| **[HyMiRec: A Hybrid Multi-interest Learning Framework for LLM-based Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13738v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential for sequential recommendation. However, current LLM-based approaches face critical limitations in modeling users' long-term and diverse interests. First, due to inference latency and feature fetching bandwidth constraints, existing methods typically truncate user behavior sequences to include only the most recent interactions, resulting in the loss of valuable long-range preference signals. Second, most current methods rely on next-item prediction with a single predicted embedding, overlooking the multifaceted nature of user interests and limiting recommendation diversity. To address these challenges, we propose HyMiRec, a hybrid multi-interest sequential recommendation framework, which leverages a lightweight recommender to extracts coarse interest embeddings from long user sequences and an LLM-based recommender to captures refined interest embeddings. To alleviate the overhead of fetching features, we introduce a residual codebook based on cosine similarity, enabling efficient compression and reuse of user history embeddings. To model the diverse preferences of users, we design a disentangled multi-interest learning module, which leverages multiple interest queries to learn disentangles multiple interest signals adaptively, allowing the model to capture different facets of user intent. Extensive experiments are conducted on both benchmark datasets and a collected industrial dataset, demonstrating our effectiveness over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, online A/B testing shows that HyMiRec brings consistent improvements in real-world recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[I$^3$-MRec: Invariant Learning with Information Bottleneck for Incomplete Modality Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04247v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommender systems (MRS) improve recommendation performance by integrating complementary semantic information from multiple modalities. However, the assumption of complete multimodality rarely holds in practice due to missing images and incomplete descriptions, hindering model robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method called \textbf{I$^3$-MRec}, which uses \textbf{I}nvariant learning with \textbf{I}nformation bottleneck principle for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}odality \textbf{Rec}ommendation. To achieve robust performance in missing modality scenarios, I$^3$-MRec enforces two pivotal properties: (i) cross-modal preference invariance, ensuring consistent user preference modeling across varying modality environments, and (ii) compact yet effective multimodal representation, as modality information becomes unreliable in such scenarios, reducing the dependence on modality-specific information is particularly important. By treating each modality as a distinct semantic environment, I$^3$-MRec employs invariant risk minimization (IRM) to learn preference-oriented representations. In parallel, a missing-aware fusion module is developed to explicitly simulate modality-missing scenarios. Built upon the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, the module aims to preserve essential user preference signals across these scenarios while effectively compressing modality-specific information. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that I$^3$-MRec consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art MRS methods across various modality-missing scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM Multimedia 2025 Accepted</p></details> |
| **[MADREC: A Multi-Aspect Driven LLM Agent for Explainable and Adaptive Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13371v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent attempts to integrate large language models (LLMs) into recommender systems have gained momentum, but most remain limited to simple text generation or static prompt-based inference, failing to capture the complexity of user preferences and real-world interactions. This study proposes the Multi-Aspect Driven LLM Agent MADRec, an autonomous LLM-based recommender that constructs user and item profiles by unsupervised extraction of multi-aspect information from reviews and performs direct recommendation, sequential recommendation, and explanation generation. MADRec generates structured profiles via aspect-category-based summarization and applies Re-Ranking to construct high-density inputs. When the ground-truth item is missing from the output, the Self-Feedback mechanism dynamically adjusts the inference criteria. Experiments across multiple domains show that MADRec outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines in both precision and explainability, with human evaluation further confirming the persuasiveness of the generated explanations.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Improving Visual Recommendation on E-commerce Platforms Using Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13359v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On large-scale e-commerce platforms with tens of millions of active monthly users, recommending visually similar products is essential for enabling users to efficiently discover items that align with their preferences. This study presents the application of a vision-language model (VLM) -- which has demonstrated strong performance in image recognition and image-text retrieval tasks -- to product recommendations on Mercari, a major consumer-to-consumer marketplace used by more than 20 million monthly users in Japan. Specifically, we fine-tuned SigLIP, a VLM employing a sigmoid-based contrastive loss, using one million product image-title pairs from Mercari collected over a three-month period, and developed an image encoder for generating item embeddings used in the recommendation system. Our evaluation comprised an offline analysis of historical interaction logs and an online A/B test in a production environment. In offline analysis, the model achieved a 9.1% improvement in nDCG@5 compared with the baseline. In the online A/B test, the click-through rate improved by 50% whereas the conversion rate improved by 14% compared with the existing model. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of VLM-based encoders for e-commerce product recommendations and provide practical insights into the development of visual similarity-based recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM RecSys 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Kernel Representation and Similarity Measure for Incomplete Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13352v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measuring similarity between incomplete data is a fundamental challenge in web mining, recommendation systems, and user behavior analysis. Traditional approaches either discard incomplete data or perform imputation as a preprocessing step, leading to information loss and biased similarity estimates. This paper presents the proximity kernel, a new similarity measure that directly computes similarity between incomplete data in kernel feature space without explicit imputation in the original space. The proposed method introduces data-dependent binning combined with proximity assignment to project data into a high-dimensional sparse representation that adapts to local density variations. For missing value handling, we propose a cascading fallback strategy to estimate missing feature distributions. We conduct clustering tasks on the proposed kernel representation across 12 real world incomplete datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods while maintaining linear time complexity. All the code are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/proximity-kernel-2289.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Static LLM Policies: Imitation-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13229v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RecSys) have become critical tools for enhancing user engagement by delivering personalized content across diverse digital platforms. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential for improving RecSys, primarily due to their exceptional generalization capabilities and sophisticated contextual understanding, which facilitate the generation of flexible and interpretable recommendations. However, the direct deployment of LLMs as primary recommendation policies presents notable challenges, including persistent latency issues stemming from frequent API calls and inherent model limitations such as hallucinations and biases. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework that leverages imitation learning from LLM-generated trajectories. Specifically, inverse reinforcement learning is employed to extract robust reward models from LLM demonstrations. This approach negates the need for LLM fine-tuning, thereby substantially reducing computational overhead. Simultaneously, the RL policy is guided by the cumulative rewards derived from these demonstrations, effectively transferring the semantic insights captured by the LLM. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating superior performance when compared against state-of-the-art RL-based and in-context learning baselines.

| **[Rec-R1: Bridging Generative Large Language Models and User-Centric Recommendation Systems via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24289v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Rec-R1, a general reinforcement learning framework that bridges large language models (LLMs) with recommendation systems through closed-loop optimization. Unlike prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Rec-R1 directly optimizes LLM generation using feedback from a fixed black-box recommendation model, without relying on synthetic SFT data from proprietary models such as GPT-4o. This avoids the substantial cost and effort required for data distillation. To verify the effectiveness of Rec-R1, we evaluate it on two representative tasks: product search and sequential recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-R1 not only consistently outperforms prompting- and SFT-based methods, but also achieves significant gains over strong discriminative baselines, even when used with simple retrievers such as BM25. Moreover, Rec-R1 preserves the general-purpose capabilities of the LLM, unlike SFT, which often impairs instruction-following and reasoning. These findings suggest Rec-R1 as a promising foundation for continual task-specific adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the TMLR journal</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of Graph Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02164v4)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph unlearning emerges as a crucial advancement in the pursuit of responsible AI, providing the means to remove sensitive data traces from trained models, thereby upholding the \textit{right to be forgotten}. It is evident that graph machine learning exhibits sensitivity to data privacy and adversarial attacks, necessitating the application of graph unlearning techniques to address these concerns effectively. In this comprehensive survey paper, we present the first systematic review of graph unlearning approaches, encompassing a diverse array of methodologies and offering a detailed taxonomy and up-to-date literature overview to facilitate the understanding of researchers new to this field. To ensure clarity, we provide lucid explanations of the fundamental concepts and evaluation measures used in graph unlearning, catering to a broader audience with varying levels of expertise. Delving into potential applications, we explore the versatility of graph unlearning across various domains, including but not limited to social networks, adversarial settings, recommender systems, and resource-constrained environments like the Internet of Things, illustrating its potential impact in safeguarding data privacy and enhancing AI systems' robustness. Finally, we shed light on promising research directions, encouraging further progress and innovation within the domain of graph unlearning. By laying a solid foundation and fostering continued progress, this survey seeks to inspire researchers to further advance the field of graph unlearning, thereby instilling confidence in the ethical growth of AI systems and reinforcing the responsible application of machine learning techniques in various domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 page review paper on graph unlearning</p></details> |
| **[CTRL-Rec: Controlling Recommender Systems With Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12742v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system, they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models (LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests, and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time, we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users' sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional controls.</p></details> |  |
| **[PPA-Game: Characterizing and Learning Competitive Dynamics Among Online Content Creators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15524v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present the Proportional Payoff Allocation Game (PPA-Game), which characterizes situations where agents compete for divisible resources. In the PPA-game, agents select from available resources, and their payoffs are proportionately determined based on heterogeneous weights attributed to them. Such dynamics simulate content creators on online recommender systems like YouTube and TikTok, who compete for finite consumer attention, with content exposure reliant on inherent and distinct quality. We first conduct a game-theoretical analysis of the PPA-Game. While the PPA-Game does not always guarantee the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE), we identify prevalent scenarios ensuring its existence. Simulated experiments further prove that the cases where PNE does not exist rarely happen. Beyond analyzing static payoffs, we further discuss the agents' online learning about resource payoffs by integrating a multi-player multi-armed bandit framework. We propose an online algorithm facilitating each agent's maximization of cumulative payoffs over $T$ rounds. Theoretically, we establish that the regret of any agent is bounded by $O(\log^{1 + \eta} T)$ for any $\eta > 0$. Empirical results further validate the effectiveness of our online learning approach.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |
| **[Leveraging Language Semantics for Collaborative Filtering with TextGCN and TextGCN-MLP: Zero-Shot vs In-Domain Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12461v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, various approaches have been proposed to leverage large language models (LLMs) for incorporating textual information about items into recommender systems. Existing methods primarily focus on either fine-tuning LLMs to generate recommendations or integrating LLM-based embeddings into downstream models. In this work, we follow the latter direction and propose \textbf{TextGCN}, which applies parameter-free graph convolution layers directly over LLM-based item-title embeddings, instead of learning ID-based embeddings as in traditional methods. By combining language semantics with graph message passing, this architecture achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, significantly outperforming prior approaches. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{TextGCN-MLP}, which extends TextGCN with a trainable multilayer perceptron trained using a contrastive loss, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain performance on recommendation benchmarks. However, the zero-shot performance of TextGCN-MLP remains lower than that of TextGCN, highlighting the trade-off between in-domain specialization and zero-shot generalization. We release our code on github at \href{https://github.com/ChernovAndrey/TFCE}{github.com/ChernovAndrey/TFCE}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Inspired Multi Modal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12325v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommender systems enhance personalized recommendations in e-commerce and online advertising by integrating visual, textual, and user-item interaction data. However, existing methods often overlook two critical biases: (i) modal confounding, where latent factors (e.g., brand style or product category) simultaneously drive multiple modalities and influence user preference, leading to spurious feature-preference associations; (ii) interaction bias, where genuine user preferences are mixed with noise from exposure effects and accidental clicks. To address these challenges, we propose a Causal-inspired multimodal Recommendation framework. Specifically, we introduce a dual-channel cross-modal diffusion module to identify hidden modal confounders, utilize back-door adjustment with hierarchical matching and vector-quantized codebooks to block confounding paths, and apply front-door adjustment combined with causal topology reconstruction to build a deconfounded causal subgraph. Extensive experiments on three real-world e-commerce datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining strong interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaptJobRec: Enhancing Conversational Career Recommendation through an LLM-Powered Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13423v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems (CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However, agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency. For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while significantly improving recommendation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Preference Optimization for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12211v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally shifted recommender systems from discriminative to generative paradigms, where user behavior modeling is achieved by generating target items conditioned on historical interactions. Yet current generative recommenders still suffer from two core limitations: the lack of high-quality negative modeling and the reliance on implicit rewards. Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) offers a natural solution by enabling on-policy sampling of harder negatives and grounding optimization in explicit reward signals. However, applying RLVR to generative recommenders remains non-trivial. Its unique generation space often leads to invalid or repetitive items that undermine sampling efficiency, and ranking supervision is sparse since most items receive identical zero rewards. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforced Preference Optimization for Recommendation (ReRe), a reinforcement-based paradigm tailored to LLM-based recommenders, an important direction in generative recommendation. ReRe incorporates constrained beam search to improve sampling efficiency and diversify hard negatives, while augmenting rule-based accuracy rewards with auxiliary ranking rewards for finer-grained supervision. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that ReRe consistently outperforms both traditional and LLM-based recommenders in ranking performance. Further analysis shows that ReRe not only enhances performance across both base and SFT-initialized models but also generalizes robustly across different backbone families and scales. Beyond empirical gains, we systematically investigate the design space of RLVR in recommendation across generation, sampling strategy, reward modeling, and optimization algorithm, offering insights for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asking Clarifying Questions for Preference Elicitation With Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12015v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions and eliciting user preferences effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Knowledge Graph Embeddings through Contrastive Learning with Negative Statements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11868v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore, while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often overlooked during embedding training. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge into embedding learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Knowledge Capture (K-CAP 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Combining Euclidean and Hyperbolic Representations for Node-level Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11827v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the original features and structural features derived from random walks and degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Fast Top-K Selection for Large-Scale Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11472v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity. By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[On Inherited Popularity Bias in Cold-Start Item Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11402v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative filtering (CF) recommender systems struggle with making predictions on unseen, or 'cold', items. Systems designed to address this challenge are often trained with supervision from warm CF models in order to leverage collaborative and content information from the available interaction data. However, since they learn to replicate the behavior of CF methods, cold-start models may therefore also learn to imitate their predictive biases. In this paper, we show that cold-start systems can inherit popularity bias, a common cause of recommender system unfairness arising when CF models overfit to more popular items, thereby maximizing user-oriented accuracy but neglecting rarer items. We demonstrate that cold-start recommenders not only mirror the popularity biases of warm models, but are in fact affected more severely: because they cannot infer popularity from interaction data, they instead attempt to estimate it based solely on content features. This leads to significant over-prediction of certain cold items with similar content to popular warm items, even if their ground truth popularity is very low. Through experiments on three multimedia datasets, we analyze the impact of this behavior on three generative cold-start methods. We then describe a simple post-processing bias mitigation method that, by using embedding magnitude as a proxy for predicted popularity, can produce more balanced recommendations with limited harm to user-oriented cold-start accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ACM RecSys 2025</p></details> |
| **[Next Interest Flow: A Generative Pre-training Paradigm for Recommender Systems by Modeling All-domain Movelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11317v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a cornerstone of modern recommender systems, has been dominated by discriminative models that react to past user behavior rather than proactively modeling user intent. Existing generative paradigms attempt to address this but suffer from critical limitations: Large Language Model (LLM) based methods create a semantic mismatch by forcing e-commerce signals into a linguistic space, while ID-based generation is constrained by item memorization and cold-start issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel generative pre-training paradigm. Our model learns to predict the Next Interest Flow, a dense vector sequence representing a user's future intent, while simultaneously modeling its internal Interest Diversity and Interest Evolution Velocity to ensure the representation is both rich and coherent. However, this two-stage approach introduces a critical objective mismatch between the generative and discriminative stages. We resolve this via a bidirectional alignment strategy, which harmonizes the two stages through cross-stage weight initialization and a dynamic Semantic Alignment Module for fine-tuning. Additionally, we enhance the underlying discriminative model with a Temporal Sequential Pairwise (TSP) mechanism to better capture temporal causality. We present the All-domain Moveline Evolution Network (AMEN), a unified framework implementing our entire pipeline. Extensive offline experiments validate AMEN's superiority over strong baselines, and a large-scale online A/B test demonstrates its significant real-world impact, delivering substantial improvements in key business metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[MVIGER: Multi-View Variational Integration of Complementary Knowledge for Generative Recommender](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08686v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) have been widely used in recommender systems to incorporate textual information of items into item IDs, leveraging their advanced language understanding and generation capabilities. Recently, generative recommender systems have utilized the reasoning abilities of LMs to directly generate index tokens for potential items of interest based on the user's interaction history. To inject diverse item knowledge into LMs, prompt templates with detailed task descriptions and various indexing techniques derived from diverse item information have been explored. This paper focuses on the inconsistency in outputs generated by variations in input prompt templates and item index types, even with the same user's interaction history. Our in-depth quantitative analysis reveals that preference knowledge learned from diverse prompt templates and heterogeneous indices differs significantly, indicating a high potential for complementarity. To fully exploit this complementarity and provide consistent performance under varying prompts and item indices, we propose MVIGER, a unified variational framework that models selection among these information sources as a categorical latent variable with a learnable prior. During inference, this prior enables the model to adaptively select the most relevant source or aggregate predictions across multiple sources, thereby ensuring high-quality recommendation across diverse template-index combinations. We validate the effectiveness of MVIGER on three real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing generative recommender baselines through the effective integration of complementary knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[HoMer: Addressing Heterogeneities by Modeling Sequential and Set-wise Contexts for CTR Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11100v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which models behavior sequence and non-sequential features (e.g., user/item profiles or cross features) to infer user interest, underpins industrial recommender systems. However, most methods face three forms of heterogeneity that degrade predictive performance: (i) Feature Heterogeneity persists when limited sequence side features provide less granular interest representation compared to extensive non-sequential features, thereby impairing sequence modeling performance; (ii) Context Heterogeneity arises because a user's interest in an item will be influenced by other items, yet point-wise prediction neglects cross-item interaction context from the entire item set; (iii) Architecture Heterogeneity stems from the fragmented integration of specialized network modules, which compounds the model's effectiveness, efficiency and scalability in industrial deployments. To tackle the above limitations, we propose HoMer, a Homogeneous-Oriented TransforMer for modeling sequential and set-wise contexts. First, we align sequence side features with non-sequential features for accurate sequence modeling and fine-grained interest representation. Second, we shift the prediction paradigm from point-wise to set-wise, facilitating cross-item interaction in a highly parallel manner. Third, HoMer's unified encoder-decoder architecture achieves dual optimization through structural simplification and shared computation, ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining scalability with model size. Without arduous modification to the prediction pipeline, HoMer successfully scales up and outperforms our industrial baseline by 0.0099 in the AUC metric, and enhances online business metrics like CTR/RPM by 1.99%/2.46%. Additionally, HoMer saves 27% of GPU resources via preliminary engineering optimization, further validating its superiority and practicality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Decoupled Multimodal Fusion for User Interest Modeling in Click-Through Rate Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11066v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern industrial recommendation systems improve recommendation performance by integrating multimodal representations from pre-trained models into ID-based Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction frameworks. However, existing approaches typically adopt modality-centric modeling strategies that process ID-based and multimodal embeddings independently, failing to capture fine-grained interactions between content semantics and behavioral signals. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Multimodal Fusion (DMF), which introduces a modality-enriched modeling strategy to enable fine-grained interactions between ID-based collaborative representations and multimodal representations for user interest modeling. Specifically, we construct target-aware features to bridge the semantic gap across different embedding spaces and leverage them as side information to enhance the effectiveness of user interest modeling. Furthermore, we design an inference-optimized attention mechanism that decouples the computation of target-aware features and ID-based embeddings before the attention layer, thereby alleviating the computational bottleneck introduced by incorporating target-aware features. To achieve comprehensive multimodal integration, DMF combines user interest representations learned under the modality-centric and modality-enriched modeling strategies. Offline experiments on public and industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DMF.

However, retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model, facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems. Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically from the models via minor model refinement. Specifically, a novel TranSUN method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods across data from various domains, which have been successfully deployed in two real-world industrial recommendation scenarios, i.e. product and short video recommendation scenarios in Guess What You Like business domain in the homepage of Taobao App (a leading e-commerce platform with DAU > 300M), to serve the major online traffic.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures, NeurIPS 2025 Poster</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Node Affinity Prediction in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06940v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS - Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising, training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is available at https://github.com/orfeld415/NAVIS</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Does LLM Focus on the Right Words? Diagnosing Language Bias in LLM-based Recommenders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10978v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), owing to their extensive open-domain knowledge and semantic reasoning capabilities, have been increasingly integrated into recommender systems (RS). However, a substantial gap remains between the pre-training objectives of LLMs and the specific requirements of recommendation tasks. To address this gap, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly performed on specially curated recommendation datasets to further enhance their predictive ability. Despite its success, SFT exhibits a critical limitation: it induces Language Bias, whereby the model over-relies on auxiliary tokens-such as task descriptions and prefix-generated tokens-while underutilizing core user interaction tokens that encode user-specific preferences. This bias not only undermines recommendation accuracy but also raises unfairness concerns. To address this issue, we propose Group Distributionally Robust Optimization-based Tuning (GDRT), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that enforces consistent model performance across token groups with varying degrees of relevance to auxiliary tokens. By adaptively upweighting underperforming groups, typically those weakly correlated with auxiliary tokens, GDRT shifts the model's attention from superficial auxiliary cues to informative user interaction tokens, thereby mitigating language bias. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that GDRT effectively mitigates language bias, yielding substantial improvements in recommendation accuracy (with an average NDCG@10 gain of 24.29%) and significantly enhancing recommendation fairness.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches face three critical limitations: (i) reliance on noisy and unreliable behavioral signals; (ii) insufficient user-level information due to the lack of diverse interaction data; and (iii) a systemic training bias toward high-activity users that overshadows the needs of low-activity users. To address these challenges, we propose ChoirRec, a novel framework that leverages the semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic user groups and enhance CVR prediction for low-activity users. With a dual-channel architecture designed for robust cross-user knowledge transfer, ChoirRec comprises three components: (i) a Semantic Group Generation module that utilizes LLMs to form reliable, cross-activity user clusters, thereby filtering out noisy signals; (ii) a Group-aware Hierarchical Representation module that enriches sparse user embeddings with informative group-level priors to mitigate data insufficiency; and (iii) a Group-aware Multi-granularity Modual that employs a dual-channel architecture and adaptive fusion mechanism to ensure effective learning and utilization of group knowledge. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments on Taobao, a leading industrial-scale e-commerce platform. ChoirRec improves GAUC by 1.16\% in offline evaluations, while online A/B testing reveals a 7.24\% increase in order volume, highlighting its substantial practical value in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Historical interaction sequences often contain irrelevant noisy items, which significantly hinders the performance of recommendation systems. Existing research employs unsupervised methods that indirectly identify item-granularity irrelevant noise by predicting the ground truth item. Since these methods lack explicit noise labels, they are prone to misidentify users' interested items as noise. Additionally, while these methods focus on removing item-granularity noise driven by the ground truth item, they overlook interest-granularity noise, limiting their ability to perform broader denoising based on user interests. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Granularity Sequence Denoising with Weakly Supervised Signal for Sequential Recommendation(MGSD-WSS). MGSD-WSS first introduces the Multiple Gaussian Kernel Perceptron module to map the original and enhance sequence into a common representation space and utilizes weakly supervised signals to accurately identify noisy items in the historical interaction sequence. Subsequently, it employs the item-granularity denoising module with noise-weighted contrastive learning to obtain denoised item representations. Then, it extracts target interest representations from the ground truth item and applies noise-weighted contrastive learning to obtain denoised interest representations. Finally, based on the denoised item and interest representations, MGSD-WSS predicts the next item. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sequence recommendation and denoising models. Our code is available at https://github.com/lalunex/MGSD-WSS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Long-Term User Welfare in Recommender Systems via Creator-Oriented Information Revelation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10511v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the long-term user welfare (e.g., sustained user engagement) has become a central objective of recommender systems (RS). In real-world platforms, the creation behaviors of content creators plays a crucial role in shaping long-term welfare beyond short-term recommendation accuracy, making the effective steering of creator behavior essential to foster a healthier RS ecosystem. Existing works typically rely on re-ranking algorithms that heuristically adjust item exposure to steer creators' behavior. However, when embedded within recommendation pipelines, such a strategy often conflicts with the short-term objective of improving recommendation accuracy, leading to performance degradation and suboptimal long-term welfare. The well-established economics studies offer us valuable insights for an alternative approach without relying on recommendation algorithmic design: revealing information from an information-rich party (sender) to a less-informed party (receiver) can effectively change the receiver's beliefs and steer their behavior. Inspired by this idea, we propose an information-revealing framework, named Long-term Welfare Optimization via Information Revelation (LoRe). In this framework, we utilize a classical information revelation method (i.e., Bayesian persuasion) to map the stakeholders in RS, treating the platform as the sender and creators as the receivers. To address the challenge posed by the unrealistic assumption of traditional economic methods, we formulate the process of information revelation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a learning algorithm trained and inferred in environments with boundedly rational creators. Extensive experiments on two real-world RS datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively outperform existing fair re-ranking methods and information revealing strategies in improving long-term user welfare.</p></details> |  |

When implemented on implicit feedback data (such as clicks), a common heuristic is to upweight the observed interactions. This strategy has been shown to improve performance for certain algorithms. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of various weighting schemes and matrix factorization algorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that training with unweighted data can perform comparably to, and sometimes outperform, training with weighted data, especially for large models. This observation challenges the conventional wisdom. Nevertheless, we identify cases where weighting can be beneficial, particularly for models with lower capacity and specific regularization schemes. We also derive efficient algorithms for exactly minimizing several weighted objectives that were previously considered computationally intractable. Our work provides a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between weighting, regularization, and model capacity in matrix factorization for recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the proceedings of the Web Conference (WWW) 2025 (11 pages)</p></details> |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Retrieval Methods in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21022v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era dominated by information overload, effective recommender systems are essential for managing the deluge of data across digital platforms. Multi-stage cascade ranking systems are widely used in the industry, with retrieval and ranking being two typical stages. Retrieval methods sift through vast candidates to filter out irrelevant items, while ranking methods prioritize these candidates to present the most relevant items to users. Unlike studies focusing on the ranking stage, this survey explores the critical yet often overlooked retrieval stage of recommender systems. To achieve precise and efficient personalized retrieval, we summarize existing work in three key areas: improving similarity computation between user and item, enhancing indexing mechanisms for efficient retrieval, and optimizing training methods of retrieval. We also provide a comprehensive set of benchmarking experiments on three public datasets. Furthermore, we highlight current industrial applications through a case study on retrieval practices at a specific company, covering the entire retrieval process and online serving, along with practical implications and challenges. By detailing the retrieval stage, which is fundamental for effective recommendation, this survey aims to bridge the existing knowledge gap and serve as a cornerstone for researchers interested in optimizing this critical component of cascade recommender systems.</p></details> | 41 pages |

It plays a crucial role in determining the final exposure, directly influencing user experience. Recently, generative reranking has gained increasing attention for its strong ability to model complex dependencies among items. However, most existing methods suffer from the "likelihood trap", where high-likelihood sequences are often perceived as low-quality by humans. These models tend to repeatedly recommend a set of high-frequency items, resulting in list homogeneity, thereby limiting user engagement. In this work, we propose Consistent Graph-structured Generative Recommendation (Congrats), a novel generative reranking framework. To break the likelihood trap, we introduce a novel graph-structured decoder that can capture diverse sequences along multiple paths. This design not only expands the decoding space to promote diversity, but also improves prediction accuracy by implicit item dependencies derived from vertex transitions. Furthermore, we design a differentiable cascade system that incorporates an evaluator, enabling the model to learn directly from user preferences as the training objective. Extensive offline experiments validate the superior performance of Congrats over state-of-the-art reranking methods. Moreover, Congrats has been evaluated on a large-scale video-sharing app, Kuaishou, with over 300 million daily active users, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves both recommendation quality and diversity, validating our effectiveness in practical industrial environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Structure-Aware Attention and Knowledge Graphs in Explainable Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10109v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper designs and implements an explainable recommendation model that integrates knowledge graphs with structure-aware attention mechanisms. The model is built on graph neural networks and incorporates a multi-hop neighbor aggregation strategy. By integrating the structural information of knowledge graphs and dynamically assigning importance to different neighbors through an attention mechanism, the model enhances its ability to capture implicit preference relationships. In the proposed method, users and items are embedded into a unified graph structure. Multi-level semantic paths are constructed based on entities and relations in the knowledge graph to extract richer contextual information. During the rating prediction phase, recommendations are generated through the interaction between user and target item representations. The model is optimized using a binary cross-entropy loss function. Experiments conducted on the Amazon Books dataset validate the superior performance of the proposed model across various evaluation metrics. The model also shows good convergence and stability. These results further demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of structure-aware attention mechanisms in knowledge graph-enhanced recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lighter-X: An Efficient and Plug-and-play Strategy for Graph-based Recommendation through Decoupled Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10105v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose \textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters, identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.</p></details> |  |

However, using personal information in machine learning applications has sparked significant security and privacy concerns about user data. To address these challenges, different privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) frameworks have been developed to protect sensitive information in machine learning applications. These frameworks generally attempt to balance design trade-offs such as computational efficiency, communication overhead, security guarantees, and scalability. Despite the advancements, selecting the optimal framework and parameters for specific deployment scenarios remains a complex and critical challenge for privacy and security application developers. We present Prismo, an open-source recommendation system designed to aid in selecting optimal parameters and frameworks for different PPML application scenarios. Prismo enables users to explore a comprehensive space of PPML frameworks through various properties based on user-defined objectives. It supports automated filtering of suitable candidate frameworks by considering parameters such as the number of parties in multi-party computation or federated learning and computation cost constraints in homomorphic encryption. Prismo models every use case into a Linear Integer Programming optimization problem, ensuring tailored solutions are recommended for each scenario. We evaluate Prismo's effectiveness through multiple use cases, demonstrating its ability to deliver best-fit solutions in different deployment scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAWRMAC: A Novel Dynamic Graph Representation Learning Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09884v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graph representation learning has become essential for analyzing evolving networks in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and traffic analysis. However, existing continuous-time methods face three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations. Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable, generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning.

Due to the fact that there are multiple optimization tasks depending on the ad domain, e.g., Click Through Rate (CTR) for click ads and Conversion Rate (CVR) for conversion ads, as well as multiple surfaces where an ad is served (home feed, search, or related item recommendation) with diverse ad products (shopping or standard ad); it is an essentially challenging problem in industry on how to do joint holistic optimization in the lightweight ranker, such that the overall platform's value, advertiser's value, and user's value are maximized. Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based multitask learning (MTL) can handle multiple goals naturally, with each prediction head mapping to a particular optimization goal. However, in practice, it is unclear how to unify data from different surfaces and ad products into a single model. It is critical to learn domain-specialized knowledge and explicitly transfer knowledge between domains to make MTL effective. We present a Multi-Task Multi-Domain (MTMD) architecture under the classic Two-Tower paradigm, with the following key contributions: 1) handle different prediction tasks, ad products, and ad serving surfaces in a unified framework; 2) propose a novel mixture-of-expert architecture to learn both specialized knowledge each domain and common knowledge shared between domains; 3) propose a domain adaption module to encourage knowledge transfer between experts; 4) constrain the modeling of different prediction tasks. MTMD improves the offline loss value by 12% to 36%, mapping to 2% online reduction in cost per click. We have deployed this single MTMD framework into production for Pinterest ad recommendation replacing 9 production models.</p></details> | AdKDD 2025 |
| **[From Entity Reliability to Clean Feedback: An Entity-Aware Denoising Framework Beyond Interaction-Level Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10851v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit feedback is central to modern recommender systems but is inherently noisy, often impairing model training and degrading user experience. At scale, such noise can mislead learning processes, reducing both recommendation accuracy and platform value. Existing denoising strategies typically overlook the entity-specific nature of noise while introducing high computational costs and complex hyperparameter tuning. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{EARD} (\textbf{E}ntity-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}eliability-\textbf{D}riven Denoising), a lightweight framework that shifts the focus from interaction-level signals to entity-level reliability. Motivated by the empirical observation that training loss correlates with noise, EARD quantifies user and item reliability via their average training losses as a proxy for reputation, and integrates these entity-level factors with interaction-level confidence. The framework is \textbf{model-agnostic}, \textbf{computationally efficient}, and requires \textbf{only two intuitive hyperparameters}. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate that EARD yields substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., up to 27.01\% gain in NDCG@50), while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Comprehensive ablation studies and mechanism analyses further confirm EARD's robustness to hyperparameter choices and its practical scalability. These results highlight the importance of entity-aware reliability modeling for denoising implicit feedback and pave the way for more robust recommendation research.</p></details> |  |

These systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations. A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics 2025</p></details> |

While most existing approaches optimize for short-term engagement, recent work has begun to explore reinforcement learning (RL) to model long-term user value. However, these efforts face significant challenges due to the vast, dynamic action spaces inherent in recommendation, which hinder stable policy learning. To resolve this bottleneck, we introduce Hierarchical Semantic RL (HSRL), which reframes RL-based recommendation over a fixed Semantic Action Space (SAS). HSRL encodes items as Semantic IDs (SIDs) for policy learning, and maps SIDs back to their original items via a fixed, invertible lookup during execution. To align decision-making with SID generation, the Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN) operates in a coarse-to-fine manner, employing hierarchical residual state modeling to refine each level's context from the previous level's residual, thereby stabilizing training and reducing representation-decision mismatch. In parallel, a Multi-level Critic (MLC) provides token-level value estimates, enabling fine-grained credit assignment. Across public benchmarks and a large-scale production dataset from a leading Chinese short-video advertising platform, HSRL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In online deployment over a seven-day A/B testing, it delivers an 18.421% CVR lift with only a 1.251% increase in cost, supporting HSRL as a scalable paradigm for RL-based recommendation. Our code is released at https://github.com/MinmaoWang/HSRL.</p></details> |  |

A fundamental challenge in this domain is learning effective embeddings from sparse user-item interactions. While contrastive learning has recently emerged as a promising solution to this issue, generating augmented views for contrastive learning through most existing random data augmentation methods often leads to the alteration of original semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, GDA4Rec (Generative Data Augmentation in graph contrastive learning for Recommendation) to generate high-quality augmented views and provide robust self-supervised signals. Specifically, we employ a noise generation module that leverages deep generative models to approximate the distribution of original data for data augmentation. Additionally, GDA4Rec further extracts an item complement matrix to characterize the latent correlations between items and provide additional self-supervised signals. Lastly, a joint objective that integrates recommendation, data augmentation and contrastive learning is used to enforce the model to learn more effective and informative embeddings. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the model.

We observe that in complex tasks such as dexterous manipulation and restricted locomotion with mobility constraints, the Q-function exhibits many local optima, making gradient ascent prone to getting stuck. To address this, we introduce SAVO, an actor architecture that (i) generates multiple action proposals and selects the one with the highest Q-value, and (ii) approximates the Q-function repeatedly by truncating poor local optima to guide gradient ascent more effectively. We evaluate tasks such as restricted locomotion, dexterous manipulation, and large discrete-action space recommender systems and show that our actor finds optimal actions more frequently and outperforms alternate actor architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Outst...</summary><p>Outstanding Paper Award on Empirical Reinforcement Learning Research, RLC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Generative Recommendation with Continuous Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12007v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhancing recommender systems (RecSys). Most existing LLM-based RecSys approaches operate in a discrete space, using vector-quantized tokenizers to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, these quantization methods often result in lossy tokenization and suboptimal learning, primarily due to inaccurate gradient propagation caused by the non-differentiable argmin operation in standard vector quantization. Inspired by the emerging trend of embracing continuous tokens in language models, we propose ContRec, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates continuous tokens into LLM-based RecSys. Specifically, ContRec consists of two key modules: a sigma-VAE Tokenizer, which encodes users/items with continuous tokens; and a Dispersive Diffusion module, which captures implicit user preference. The tokenizer is trained with a continuous Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) objective, where three effective techniques are adopted to avoid representation collapse. By conditioning on the previously generated tokens of the LLM backbone during user modeling, the Dispersive Diffusion module performs a conditional diffusion process with a novel Dispersive Loss, enabling high-quality user preference generation through next-token diffusion. Finally, ContRec leverages both the textual reasoning output from the LLM and the latent representations produced by the diffusion model for Top-K item retrieval, thereby delivering comprehensive recommendation results. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that \ourname{} consistently outperforms both traditional and SOTA LLM-based recommender systems. Our results highlight the potential of continuous tokenization and generative modeling for advancing the next generation of recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WWW 2026.

Building on this foundation, we introduce a human-AI collaborative profile for a movie recommender system that presents editable personalized interest summaries of a user's movie history. Unlike static profiles, this design invites users to directly inspect, modify, and reflect on the system's inferences. In an eight-week online field deployment with 1775 active movie recommender users, we find persistent gaps between user-perceived and system-inferred interests, show how the profile encourages engagement and reflection, and identify design directions for leveraging imperfect AI-powered user profiles to stimulate more user intervention and build more transparent and trustworthy recommender experiences.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing large language model (LLM)-based recommenders often fall short of mimicking the flexible, context-aware decision strategies humans exhibit, neglecting the structured, dynamic, and context-aware mechanisms fundamental to human behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose RecPO, a preference optimization framework that models structured feedback and contextual delay to emulate human-like prioritization in sequential recommendation. RecPO exploits adaptive reward margins based on inferred preference hierarchies and temporal signals, enabling the model to favor immediately relevant items and to distinguish between varying degrees of preference and aversion. Extensive experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate that RecPO not only yields performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines, but also mirrors key characteristics of human decision-making: favoring timely satisfaction, maintaining coherent preferences, and exercising discernment under shifting contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Learning Augmented Social Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15695v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are essential for modern content platforms, yet traditional behavior-based models often struggle with cold users who have limited interaction data. Engaging these users is crucial for platform growth. To bridge this gap, we propose leveraging the social-relation graph to enrich interest representations from behavior-based models. However, extracting value from social graphs is challenging due to relation noise and cross-domain inconsistency. To address the noise propagation and obtain accurate social interest, we employ a dual-view denoising strategy, employing low-rank SVD to the user-item interaction matrix for a denoised social graph and contrastive learning to align the original and reconstructed social graphs. Addressing the interest inconsistency between social and behavioral interests, we adopt a "mutual distillation" technique to isolate the original interests into aligned social/behavior interests and social/behavior specific interests, maximizing the utility of both. Experimental results on widely adopted industry datasets verify the method's effectiveness, particularly for cold users, offering a fresh perspective for future research. The implementation can be accessed at https://github.com/WANGLin0126/CLSRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Panorama: Fast-Track Nearest Neighbors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00566v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space, aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns. Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generation and annotation of item usage scenarios in e-commerce using large language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07885v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complementary recommendations suggest combinations of useful items that play important roles in e-commerce. However, complementary relationships are often subjective and vary among individuals, making them difficult to infer from historical data. Unlike conventional history-based methods that rely on statistical co-occurrence, we focus on the underlying usage context that motivates item combinations. We hypothesized that people select complementary items by imagining specific usage scenarios and identifying the needs in such situations. Based on this idea, we explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate item usage scenarios as a starting point for constructing complementary recommendation systems. First, we evaluated the plausibility of LLM-generated scenarios through manual annotation. The results demonstrated that approximately 85% of the generated scenarios were determined to be plausible, suggesting that LLMs can effectively generate realistic item usage scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Maximum In-Support Return Modeling for Dynamic Recommendation with Language Model Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12816v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning-based recommender systems (RLRS) offer an effective way to handle sequential recommendation tasks but often face difficulties in real-world settings, where user feedback data can be sub-optimal or sparse. In this paper, we introduce MDT4Rec, an offline RLRS framework that builds on the Decision Transformer (DT) to address two major challenges: learning from sub-optimal histories and representing complex user-item interactions. First, MDT4Rec shifts the trajectory stitching procedure from the training phase to action inference, allowing the system to shorten its historical context when necessary and thereby ignore negative or unsuccessful past experiences. Second, MDT4Rec initializes DT with a pre-trained large language model (LLM) for knowledge transfer, replaces linear embedding layers with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for more flexible representations, and employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently fine-tune only a small subset of parameters. We evaluate MDT4Rec on five public datasets and in an online simulation environment, demonstrating that it outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |
| **[Energy-Guided Diffusion Sampling for Long-Term User Behavior Prediction in Reinforcement Learning-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12815v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning-based recommender systems (RL4RS) have gained attention for their ability to adapt to dynamic user preferences. However, these systems face challenges, particularly in offline settings, where data inefficiency and reliance on pre-collected trajectories limit their broader applicability. While offline reinforcement learning methods leverage extensive datasets to address these issues, they often struggle with noisy data and fail to capture long-term user preferences, resulting in suboptimal recommendation policies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diffusion-enhanced Actor-Critic for Offline RL4RS (DAC4Rec), a novel framework that integrates diffusion processes with reinforcement learning to model complex user preferences more effectively. DAC4Rec leverages the denoising capabilities of diffusion models to enhance the robustness of offline RL algorithms and incorporates a Q-value-guided policy optimization strategy to better handle suboptimal trajectories. Additionally, we introduce an energy-based sampling strategy to reduce randomness during recommendation generation, ensuring more targeted and reliable outcomes. We validate the effectiveness of DAC4Rec through extensive experiments on six real-world offline datasets and in an online simulation environment, demonstrating its ability to optimize long-term user preferences. Furthermore, we show that the proposed diffusion policy can be seamlessly integrated into other commonly used RL algorithms in RL4RS, highlighting its versatility and wide applicability.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |

Recommendation systems are a critical application domain poised to benefit significantly from the sequence modeling capabilities and world knowledge inherent in these large models. In this paper, we introduce PLUM, a framework designed to adapt pre-trained LLMs for industry-scale recommendation tasks. PLUM consists of item tokenization using Semantic IDs, continued pre-training (CPT) on domain-specific data, and task-specific fine-tuning for recommendation objectives. For fine-tuning, we focus particularly on generative retrieval, where the model is directly trained to generate Semantic IDs of recommended items based on user context. We conduct comprehensive experiments on large-scale internal video recommendation datasets. Our results demonstrate that PLUM achieves substantial improvements for retrieval compared to a heavily-optimized production model built with large embedding tables. We also present a scaling study for the model's retrieval performance, our learnings about CPT, a few enhancements to Semantic IDs, along with an overview of the training and inference methods that enable launching this framework to billions of users in YouTube.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Safely Exploring Novel Actions in Recommender Systems via Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07635v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time. The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data, however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions. Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retentive Relevance: Capturing Long-Term User Value in Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07621v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems have traditionally relied on short-term engagement signals, such as clicks and likes, to personalize content. However, these signals are often noisy, sparse, and insufficient for capturing long-term user satisfaction and retention. We introduce Retentive Relevance, a novel content-level survey-based feedback measure that directly assesses users' intent to return to the platform for similar content. Unlike other survey measures that focus on immediate satisfaction, Retentive Relevance targets forward-looking behavioral intentions, capturing longer term user intentions and providing a stronger predictor of retention. We validate Retentive Relevance using psychometric methods, establishing its convergent, discriminant, and behavioral validity. Through large-scale offline modeling, we show that Retentive Relevance significantly outperforms both engagement signals and other survey measures in predicting next-day retention, especially for users with limited historical engagement. We develop a production-ready proxy model that integrates Retentive Relevance into the final stage of a multi-stage ranking system on a social media platform. Calibrated score adjustments based on this model yield substantial improvements in engagement, and retention, while reducing exposure to low-quality content, as demonstrated by large-scale A/B experiments. This work provides the first empirically validated framework linking content-level user perceptions to retention outcomes in production systems. We offer a scalable, user-centered solution that advances both platform growth and user experience. Our work has broad implications for responsible AI development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enjoying Non-linearity in Multinomial Logistic Bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05306v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the multinomial logistic bandit problem, a variant of where a learner interacts with an environment by selecting actions to maximize expected rewards based on probabilistic feedback from multiple possible outcomes. In the binary setting, recent work has focused on understanding the impact of the non-linearity of the logistic model (Faury et al., 2020; Abeille et al., 2021). They introduced a problem-dependent constant $\kappa_* \geq 1$, that may be exponentially large in some problem parameters and which is captured by the derivative of the sigmoid function. It encapsulates the non-linearity and improves existing regret guarantees over $T$ rounds from $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T})}$ to $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the parameter space. We extend their analysis to the multinomial logistic bandit framework, making it suitable for complex applications with more than two choices, such as reinforcement learning or recommender systems. To achieve this, we extend the definition of $\kappa_*$ to the multinomial setting and propose an efficient algorithm that leverages the problem's non-linearity. Our method yields a problem-dependent regret bound of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( R d \sqrt{{KT}/{\kappa_*}})} $, where $R$ is the norm of the vector of rewards and $K$ is the number of outcomes. This improves upon the best existing guarantees of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( RdK \sqrt{T} )} $. Moreover, we provide a $\smash{ \Omega(Rd\sqrt{KT/\kappa_*})}$ lower-bound, showing that our algorithm is minimax-optimal and that our definition of $\kappa_*$ is optimal.</p></details> |  |

| **[OneVision: An End-to-End Generative Framework for Multi-view E-commerce Vision Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05759v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems, follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation. In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and +3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric, generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while simplifying the serving pathway.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some of the online experimental results in the paper are significantly different from the actual results, and need to be re-experimented and revised before submission.

We propose an LLM-based music recommendation system with tool calling to serve as a unified retrieval-reranking pipeline. Our system positions an LLM as an end-to-end recommendation system that interprets user intent, plans tool invocations, and orchestrates specialized components: boolean filters (SQL), sparse retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (embedding similarity), and generative retrieval (semantic IDs). Through tool planning, the system predicts which types of tools to use, their execution order, and the arguments needed to find music matching user preferences, supporting diverse modalities while seamlessly integrating multiple database filtering methods. We demonstrate that this unified tool-calling framework achieves competitive performance across diverse recommendation scenarios by selectively employing appropriate retrieval methods based on user queries, envisioning a new paradigm for conversational music recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at The Workshop on AI for Music, Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS-AI4Music)</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Powered Nuanced Video Attribute Annotation for Enhanced Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06657v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a case study on deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) as an advanced "annotation" mechanism to achieve nuanced content understanding (e.g., discerning content "vibe") at scale within a large-scale industrial short-form video recommendation system. Traditional machine learning classifiers for content understanding face protracted development cycles and a lack of deep, nuanced comprehension. The "LLM-as-annotators" approach addresses these by significantly shortening development times and enabling the annotation of subtle attributes. This work details an end-to-end workflow encompassing: (1) iterative definition and robust evaluation of target attributes, refined by offline metrics and online A/B testing; (2) scalable offline bulk annotation of video corpora using LLMs with multimodal features, optimized inference, and knowledge distillation for broad application; and (3) integration of these rich annotations into the online recommendation serving system, for example, through personalized restrict retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, with LLMs outperforming human raters in offline annotation quality for nuanced attributes and yielding significant improvements of user participation and satisfied consumption in online A/B tests. The study provides insights into designing and scaling production-level LLM pipelines for rich content evaluation, highlighting the adaptability and benefits of LLM-generated nuanced understanding for enhancing content discovery, user satisfaction, and the overall effectiveness of modern recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>RecSy...</summary><p>RecSys 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.</p></details> | <details><summary>this ...</summary><p>this paper is under review</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear Bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00602v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters). Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves regret $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$ with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and $|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.</p></details> |  |

Over the past decade, researchers have extensively critiqued recommender systems that prioritise news based on user engagement. To offer an alternative, researchers have analysed how recommender systems could support the media's ability to fulfil its role in democratic society by recommending news based on editorial values, particularly diversity. However, there continues to be a large gap between normative theory on how news recommender systems should incorporate diversity, and technical literature that designs such systems. We argue that to realise diversity-aware recommender systems in practice, it is crucial to pay attention to the datasets that are needed to train modern news recommenders. We aim to make two main contributions. First, we identify the information a dataset must include to enable the development of the diversity-aware news recommender systems proposed in normative literature. Based on this analysis, we assess the limitations of currently available public datasets, and show what potential they do have to expand research into diversity-aware recommender systems. Second, we analyse why and how European law and policy can be used to provide researchers with structural access to the data they need to develop diversity-aware news recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

Although federated learning offers a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving recommendations, its impact on diversity remains unclear. We introduce FedFlex, a two-stage framework that combines local, on-device fine-tuning of matrix factorization models (SVD and BPR) with a lightweight Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) re-ranking step to promote diversity. We conducted the first live user study of a federated recommender, collecting behavioral data and feedback during a two-week online deployment. Our results show that FedFlex successfully engages users, with BPR outperforming SVD in click-through rate. Re-ranking with MMR consistently improved ranking quality (nDCG) across both models, with statistically significant gains, particularly for BPR. Diversity effects varied: MMR increased coverage for both models and improved intra-list diversity for BPR, but slightly reduced it for SVD, suggesting different interactions between personalization and diversification across models. Our exit questionnaire responses indicated that most users expressed no clear preference between re-ranked and unprocessed lists, implying that increased diversity did not substantially reduce user satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

We challenge the dominant autoregressive paradigm and investigate whether explicitly modeling the future distribution or order-invariant multi-token approaches outperform order-preserving methods. We analyze local order invariance and introduce a KL-based metric to quantify temporal drift. We find that a simple explicit distribution forecasting objective consistently surpasses complex implicit baselines. We further demonstrate that mode collapse of predicted categories is primarily driven by distributional imbalance. This work provides a principled framework for selecting modeling strategies and offers practical guidance for building more accurate and robust forecasting systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages main text + 2 pages references + 6 pages appendix, 10 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear Graph Embedding with Latent Pattern Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05719v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis, social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However, current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood, effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the interactive nature of these systems poses significant challenges for automatic evaluation. This paper critically examines current evaluation practices and identifies two key limitations: the over-reliance on static test collections and the inadequacy of existing evaluation metrics. To substantiate this critique, we analyze real user interactions with nine existing CRSs and demonstrate a striking disconnect between self-reported user satisfaction and performance scores reported in prior literature. To address these limitations, this work explores the potential of user simulation to generate dynamic interaction data, offering a departure from static datasets. Furthermore, we propose novel evaluation metrics, based on a general reward/cost framework, designed to better align with real user satisfaction. Our analysis of different simulation approaches provides valuable insights into their effectiveness and reveals promising initial results, showing improved correlation with system rankings compared to human evaluation. While these findings indicate a significant step forward in CRS evaluation, we also identify areas for future research and refinement in both simulation techniques and evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 2025 Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval in the Asia Pacific Region (SIGIR-AP 2025), December 7--10, 2025, Xi'an, China</p></details> |

Our approach builds on generative diffusion models, which are well established in vision and graph generation but remain underexplored for graph signals. Existing methods lack generality, either ignoring the graph structure in the forward process or designing graph-aware mechanisms tailored to specific domains. We adopt a forward process that incorporates the graph through the heat equation. Rather than relying on the standard formulation, we consider a time-warped coefficient to mitigate the exponential decay of the drift term, yielding a graph-aware generative diffusion model (GAD). We analyze its forward dynamics, proving convergence to a Gaussian Markov random field with covariance parametrized by the graph Laplacian, and interpret the backward dynamics as a sequence of graph-signal denoising problems. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of GAD on synthetic data, real traffic speed measurements, and a temperature sensor network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compressed Concatenation of Small Embedding Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04626v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedding models are central to dense retrieval, semantic search, and recommendation systems, but their size often makes them impractical to deploy in resource-constrained environments such as browsers or edge devices. While smaller embedding models offer practical advantages, they typically underperform compared to their larger counterparts. To bridge this gap, we demonstrate that concatenating the raw embedding vectors of multiple small models can outperform a single larger baseline on standard retrieval benchmarks. To overcome the resulting high dimensionality of naive concatenation, we introduce a lightweight unified decoder trained with a Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) loss. This decoder maps the high-dimensional joint representation to a low-dimensional space, preserving most of the original performance without fine-tuning the base models. We also show that while concatenating more base models yields diminishing gains, the robustness of the decoder's representation under compression and quantization improves. Our experiments show that, on a subset of MTEB retrieval tasks, our concat-encode-quantize pipeline recovers 89\% of the original performance with a 48x compression factor when the pipeline is applied to a concatenation of four small embedding models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARCO: A Cooperative Knowledge Transfer Framework for Personalized Cross-domain Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04508v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems frequently encounter data sparsity issues, particularly when addressing cold-start scenarios involving new users or items. Multi-source cross-domain recommendation (CDR) addresses these challenges by transferring valuable knowledge from multiple source domains to enhance recommendations in a target domain. However, existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based CDR methods typically rely on a single-agent framework, leading to negative transfer issues caused by inconsistent domain contributions and inherent distributional discrepancies among source domains. To overcome these limitations, MARCO, a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based Cross-Domain recommendation framework, is proposed. It leverages cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, where each agent is dedicated to estimating the contribution from an individual source domain, effectively managing credit assignment and mitigating negative transfer. In addition, an entropy-based action diversity penalty is introduced to enhance policy expressiveness and stabilize training by encouraging diverse agents' joint actions. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate MARCO's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its robustness and strong generalization capabilities.

Existing graph-based debiasing solutions refine the aggregation process with attempts such as edge reconstruction or weight adjustment. However, these methods remain inadequate in fully alleviating popularity bias. Specifically, this is because 1) they provide no insights into graph aggregation rationality, thus lacking an optimality guarantee; 2) they fail to well balance the training and debiasing process, which undermines the effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mitigate popularity bias through rational modeling of the graph aggregation process. We reveal that graph aggregation is a special form of backdoor adjustment in causal inference, where the aggregation weight corresponds to the historical interaction likelihood distribution. Based on this insight, we devise an encoder-decoder architecture, namely Causality-aware Graph Aggregation Weight Estimator for Debiasing (CAGED), to approximate the unbiased aggregation weight by optimizing the evidence lower bound of the interaction likelihood. In order to enhance the debiasing effectiveness during early training stages, we further design a momentum update strategy that incrementally refines the aggregation weight matrix. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that CAGED outperforms existing graph-based debiasing methods.

Although transformer-based models have proven to be effective in sequential recommendations, their state growth is proportional to the length of the sequence that is being processed, which makes them expensive in terms of memory and inference costs. Our research focused on three promising directions in sequential recommendations: enhancing speed through the use of State Space Models (SSM), as they can achieve SOTA results in the sequential recommendations domain with lower latency, memory, and inference costs, as proposed by arXiv:2403.03900 improving the quality of recommendations with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Monolithic Preference Optimization without Reference Model (ORPO); and implementing adaptive batch- and step-size algorithms to reduce costs and accelerate training processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.07691 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Empowering Denoising Sequential Recommendation with Large Language Model Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04239v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation aims to capture user preferences by modeling sequential patterns in user-item interactions. However, these models are often influenced by noise such as accidental interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. Therefore, to reduce the effect of noise, some works propose explicitly identifying and removing noisy items. However, we find that simply relying on collaborative information may result in an over-denoising problem, especially for cold items. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework: Interest Alignment for Denoising Sequential Recommendation (IADSR) which integrates both collaborative and semantic information. Specifically, IADSR is comprised of two stages: in the first stage, we obtain the collaborative and semantic embeddings of each item from a traditional sequential recommendation model and an LLM, respectively. In the second stage, we align the collaborative and semantic embeddings and then identify noise in the interaction sequence based on long-term and short-term interests captured in the collaborative and semantic modalities. Our extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and its compatibility with different sequential recommendation systems.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM2025 |

However, LLMs face challenges like unstable instruction compliance, modality gaps, and high inference latency, leading to textual noise and limiting their effectiveness in recommender systems. To address these challenges, we propose UserIP-Tuning, which uses prompt-tuning to infer user profiles. It integrates the causal relationship between user profiles and behavior sequences into LLMs' prompts. It employs Expectation Maximization (EM) to infer the embedded latent profile, minimizing textual noise by fixing the prompt template. Furthermore, a profile quantization codebook bridges the modality gap by categorizing profile embeddings into collaborative IDs pre-stored for online deployment. This improves time efficiency and reduces memory usage. Experiments show that UserIP-Tuning outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. An industry application confirms its effectiveness, robustness, and transferability. The presented solution has been deployed in Huawei AppGallery's Explore page since May 2025, serving 2 million daily active users, delivering significant improvements in real-world recommendation scenarios.

However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

However, negative transfer and the seesaw phenomenon pose challenges to MTL models due to the complex and often contradictory task correlations in real-world recommendations. To address the problem while making better use of personalized information, we propose a personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad), which consists of three key components: router, updater and personalized gate network. DRGrad judges the stakes between tasks in the training process, which can leverage all valid gradients for the respective task to reduce conflicts. We evaluate the efficiency of DRGrad on complex MTL using a real-world recommendation dataset with 15 billion samples. The results show that DRGrad's superior performance over competing state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in terms of AUC (Area Under the Curve) metrics, indicating that it effectively manages task conflicts in multi-task learning environments without increasing model complexity, while also addressing the deficiencies in noise processing. Moreover, experiments on the public Census-income dataset and Synthetic dataset, have demonstrated the capability of DRGrad in judging and routing the stakes between tasks with varying degrees of correlation and personalization.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios, allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[C2AL: Cohort-Contrastive Auxiliary Learning for Large-scale Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02215v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns, neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models. Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16% reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on targeted minority cohorts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, implicit feedback, such as clicks, does not always reflect users' real preferences. For example, a user might click on a news article because of its attractive headline, but end up feeling uncomfortable after reading the content. In the absence of explicit feedback, such erroneous implicit signals may severely mislead recommender systems. In this paper, we propose MTRec, a novel sequential recommendation framework designed to align with real user preferences by uncovering their internal satisfaction on recommended items. Specifically, we introduce a mental reward model to quantify user satisfaction and propose a distributional inverse reinforcement learning approach to learn it. The learned mental reward model is then used to guide recommendation models to better align with users' real preferences. Our experiments show that MTRec brings significant improvements to a variety of recommendation models. We also deploy MTRec on an industrial short video platform and observe a 7 percent increase in average user viewing time.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Review on Harnessing Large Language Models to Overcome Recommender System Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21117v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have traditionally followed modular architectures comprising candidate generation, multi-stage ranking, and re-ranking, each trained separately with supervised objectives and hand-engineered features. While effective in many domains, such systems face persistent challenges including sparse and noisy interaction data, cold-start problems, limited personalization depth, and inadequate semantic understanding of user and item content. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new paradigm for addressing these limitations through unified, language-native mechanisms that can generalize across tasks, domains, and modalities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive technical survey of how LLMs can be leveraged to tackle key challenges in modern recommender systems. We examine the use of LLMs for prompt-driven candidate retrieval, language-native ranking, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendation, illustrating how these approaches enhance personalization, semantic alignment, and interpretability without requiring extensive task-specific supervision. LLMs further enable zero- and few-shot reasoning, allowing systems to operate effectively in cold-start and long-tail scenarios by leveraging external knowledge and contextual cues. We categorize these emerging LLM-driven architectures and analyze their effectiveness in mitigating core bottlenecks of conventional pipelines. In doing so, we provide a structured framework for understanding the design space of LLM-enhanced recommenders, and outline the trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance. Our goal is to demonstrate that LLMs are not merely auxiliary components but foundational enablers for building more adaptive, semantically rich, and user-centric recommender systems</p></details> |  |

Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AgenticRAG achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with NDCG@10 improvements of 0.4\% on Amazon Electronics, 0.8\% on MovieLens-1M, and 1.6\% on Yelp datasets.

Existing systems often rely on dense retrieval (DR), which struggles to interpret challenging queries that express broad (e.g., "cities for youth friendly activities") or indirect (e.g., "cities for a high school graduation trip") user intents. While query reformulation (QR) has been widely adopted to improve such systems, existing QR methods tend to focus only on expanding the range of query subtopics (breadth) or elaborating on the potential meaning of a query (depth), but not both. In this paper, we propose EQR (Elaborative Subtopic Query Reformulation), a large language model-based QR method that combines both breadth and depth by generating potential query subtopics with information-rich elaborations. We also introduce three new natural language recommendation benchmarks in travel, hotel, and restaurant domains to establish evaluation of NL recommendation with challenging queries. Experiments show EQR substantially outperforms state-of-the-art QR methods in various evaluation metrics, highlighting that a simple yet effective QR approach can significantly improve NL recommender systems for queries with broad and indirect user intents.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Understanding Generative Recommendation with Semantic IDs from a Model-scaling View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25522v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs), which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders (e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks. Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information, showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from 44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge lies in jointly modeling multi-view representations of news articles and capturing the dynamic, dual-scale nature of user interests-encompassing both short- and long-term preferences. Prior methods often rely on single-view features or insufficiently model user behavior across time. In this work, we introduce Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news encoding and LSTUR for hierarchical user modeling, designed for training on limited data resources. Our approach leverages BERT-based embeddings to enhance semantic representation. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Results show that our model significantly outperforms strong baselines, achieving improvements over NRMS by 1.55% in AUC and 1.15% in MRR, and over NAML by 2.45% in AUC and 1.71% in MRR. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our efficiency-focused hybrid model, which combines multi-view news modeling with dual-scale user representations for practical, resource-limited resources rather than a claim to absolute state-of-the-art (SOTA). The implementation of our model is publicly available at https://github.com/MinhNguyenDS/Co-NAML-LSTUR</p></details> | MIWAI 2025 |

Specifically, LLMs lack key pieces of information crucial for sequential recommendations, such as user behavior patterns. To address this critical gap, we propose IDLE-Adapter, a novel framework that integrates pre-trained ID embeddings, rich in domain-specific knowledge, into LLMs to improve recommendation accuracy. IDLE-Adapter acts as a bridge, transforming sparse user-item interaction data into dense, LLM-compatible representations through a Pre-trained ID Sequential Model, Dimensionality Alignment, Layer-wise Embedding Refinement, and Layer-wise Distribution Alignment. Furthermore, IDLE-Adapter demonstrates remarkable flexibility by seamlessly integrating ID embeddings from diverse ID-based sequential models and LLM architectures. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the superiority of IDLE-Adapter, achieving over 10\% and 20\% improvements in HitRate@5 and NDCG@5 metrics, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing shilling methods can generate effective and stealthy fake profiles when training data only contain rating matrix, but they lack comprehensive solutions for scenarios where side features are present and utilized by the recommender. To address this gap, we extend the Leg-UP framework by enhancing the generator architecture to incorporate side features, enabling the generation of side-feature-aware fake user profiles. Experiments on benchmarks show that our method achieves strong attack performance while maintaining stealthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ranking Items from Discrete Ratings: The Cost of Unknown User Thresholds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01871v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ranking items is a central task in many information retrieval and recommender systems. User input for the ranking task often comes in the form of ratings on a coarse discrete scale. We ask whether it is possible to recover a fine-grained item ranking from such coarse-grained ratings. We model items as having scores and users as having thresholds; a user rates an item positively if the item's score exceeds the user's threshold. Although all users agree on the total item order, estimating that order is challenging when both the scores and the thresholds are latent. Under our model, any ranking method naturally partitions the $n$ items into bins; the bins are ordered, but the items inside each bin are still unordered. Users arrive sequentially, and every new user can be queried to refine the current ranking. We prove that achieving a near-perfect ranking, measured by Spearman distance, requires $\Theta(n^2)$ users (and therefore $\Omega(n^2)$ queries). This is significantly worse than the $O(n\log n)$ queries needed to rank from comparisons; the gap reflects the additional queries needed to identify the users who have the appropriate thresholds. Our bound also quantifies the impact of a mismatch between score and threshold distributions via a quadratic divergence factor. To show the tightness of our results, we provide a ranking algorithm whose query complexity matches our bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our work reveals a tension in online ranking: diversity in thresholds is necessary to merge coarse ratings from many users into a fine-grained ranking, but this diversity has a cost if the thresholds are a priori unknown.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Explainability in CRSs is crucial as it enables users to understand the reasoning behind recommendations, increasing system transparency and trustworthiness. However, current CRSs often leverage knowledge graphs (KGs) or language models to extract and represent user preferences as latent vectors, which limits their explainability. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities that can bridge this gap by generating human-understandable preference summaries. However, effectively reasoning over user preferences in CRSs remains challenging as LLMs pre-trained on large-scale corpora may not be well-suited for analyzing user preferences. While KGs provide rich domain knowledge, integrating them with LLMs encounters a significant modality gap between structured KG information and unstructured conversations. In this paper, we propose COMPASS, a plug-and-play framework that synergizes LLMs and KGs to reason over user preferences, enhancing the performance and explainability of existing CRSs. COMPASS employs a two-stage training approach: first, it bridges the gap between the structured KG and natural language through novel graph entity captioning pre-training. Next, COMPASS optimizes user preference reasoning via knowledge-aware instruction fine-tuning, where the LLM learns to reason and summarize user preferences from dialogue histories and KG-augmented context. This enables COMPASS to perform knowledge-aware reasoning and generate interpretable user preferences that can seamlessly integrate with existing CRS models for improving recommendation performance and explainability. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of COMPASS in improving various CRS models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |

However, existing approaches face substantial challenges in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with 2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent coordination.</p></details> |  |

Target-free User Simulation for Evaluating Conversational Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16160v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have tried to simulate real-world users engaging in conversations with CRSs to create more realistic testing environments that reflect the complexity of human-agent dialogue. Despite the significant advancements, reliably evaluating the capability of CRSs to elicit user preferences still faces a significant challenge. Existing evaluation metrics often rely on target-biased user simulators that assume users have predefined preferences, leading to interactions that devolve into simplistic guessing game. These simulators typically guide the CRS toward specific target items based on fixed attributes, limiting the dynamic exploration of user preferences and struggling to capture the evolving nature of real-user interactions. Additionally, current evaluation metrics are predominantly focused on single-turn recall of target items, neglecting the intermediate processes of preference elicitation. To address this, we introduce PEPPER, a novel CRS evaluation protocol with target-free user simulators constructed from real-user interaction histories and reviews. PEPPER enables realistic user-CRS dialogues without falling into simplistic guessing games, allowing users to gradually discover their preferences through enriched interactions, thereby providing a more accurate and reliable assessment of the CRS's ability to elicit personal preferences. Furthermore, PEPPER presents detailed measures for comprehensively evaluating the preference elicitation capabilities of CRSs, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative measures that capture four distinct aspects of the preference elicitation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the validity of PEPPER as a simulation environment and conduct a thorough analysis of how effectively existing CRSs perform in preference elicitation and recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations themselves. To evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary insights beyond the quantitative results.</p></details> |  |

This adaptive UI framework addresses the limitations of traditional static interfaces by integrating digital image processing, face recognition, and emotion detection techniques. Face2Feel analyzes user expressions utilizing a webcam or pre-installed camera as the primary data source to personalize the UI in real-time. Although dynamically changing user interfaces based on emotional states are not yet widely implemented, their advantages and the demand for such systems are evident. This research contributes to the development of emotion-aware applications, particularly in recommendation systems and feedback mechanisms. A case study, "Shresta: Emotion-Based Book Recommendation System," demonstrates the practical implementation of this framework, the technologies employed, and the system's usefulness. Furthermore, a user survey conducted after presenting the working model reveals a strong demand for such adaptive interfaces, emphasizing the importance of user satisfaction and comfort in human-computer interaction.

| **[Reinforced Strategy Optimization for Conversational Recommender Systems via Network-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26093v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations through multi-turn natural language interactions with users. Given the strong interaction and reasoning skills of Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging LLMs for CRSs has recently emerged as a promising direction. However, existing LLM-based methods often lack explicit optimization of interaction strategies, instead relying on unified prompts and the LLM's internal knowledge to decide how to interact, which can lead to suboptimal outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO) method for CRS, which decomposes the process of generating strategy-driven response decisions into the macro-level strategy planning and micro-level strategy adaptation through a network-of-experts architecture. At the macro level, a Planner expert selects macro-level interaction strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage). At the micro level, an Actor expert generates detailed responses conditioned on the selected macro-level strategy, guided by auxiliary experts that provide complementary information such as user preferences and factual grounding. This hierarchical decomposition disentangles the optimization of different sub-tasks involved in CRS response generation, enabling more tractable learning at each level. To address the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn training data, we formulate strategy learning as a reinforcement learning problem, guided by an LLM-based reward model to achieve automatic strategy exploration. Extensive experiments show that RSO significantly improves interaction performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit hierarchical strategy optimization for CRS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive Recommendation Agent with Active User Commands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21317v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes.</p></details> | Under Review |

Analyzing Content Creator Earnings Across Large Social Media Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26523v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines whether monthly content creator earnings follow a power law distribution, driven by compounding 'rich-get-richer' dynamics (Barabasi and Albert 1999). Patreon creator earnings data for 2018, 2021, and 2024 for Instagram, Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Patreon exhibit a power law exponent around $\alpha = 2$. This suggests that algorithmic systems generate unequalizing returns closer to highly concentrated capital income and wealth, rather than labor income. Platforms governed by powerful and compounding recommendation systems, such as Instagram and YouTube, exhibit both a stronger power law relation (lower $\alpha$) and lower mean, median, and interquartile earnings, indicating algorithms that disproportionately favor top earners at the expense of a 'middle class' of creators. In contrast, Twitter and Patreon have a more moderate $\alpha$, with less earnings inequality and higher middle class earnings. Policies which incentivize the algorithmic promotion of longer-tail content (to explore more and exploit less) may help creator ecosystems become more equitable and sustainable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Informed Dataset Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26448v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The selection of datasets in recommender systems research lacks a systematic methodology. Researchers often select datasets based on popularity rather than empirical suitability. We developed the APS Explorer, a web application that implements the Algorithm Performance Space (APS) framework for informed dataset selection. The system analyzes 96 datasets using 28 algorithms across three metrics (nDCG, Hit Ratio, Recall) at five K-values. We extend the APS framework with a statistical based classification system that categorizes datasets into five difficulty levels based on quintiles. We also introduce a variance-normalized distance metric based on Mahalanobis distance to measure similarity. The APS Explorer was successfully developed with three interactive modules for visualizing algorithm performance, direct comparing algorithms, and analyzing dataset metadata. This tool shifts the process of selecting datasets from intuition-based to evidence-based practices, and it is publicly available at datasets.recommender-systems.com.</p></details> | 45 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Catalog-Native LLM: Speaking Item-ID Dialect with Less Entanglement for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05125v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While collaborative filtering delivers predictive accuracy and efficiency, and Large Language Models (LLMs) enable expressive and generalizable reasoning, modern recommendation systems must bring these strengths together. Growing user expectations, such as natural-language queries and transparent explanations, further highlight the need for a unified approach. However, doing so is nontrivial. Collaborative signals are often token-efficient but semantically opaque, while LLMs are semantically rich but struggle to model implicit user preferences when trained only on textual inputs. This paper introduces Item-ID + Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts Language Model (IDIOMoE), which treats item interaction histories as a native dialect within the language space, enabling collaborative signals to be understood in the same way as natural language. By splitting the Feed Forward Network of each block of a pretrained LLM into a separate text expert and an item expert with token-type gating, our method avoids destructive interference between text and catalog modalities. IDIOMoE demonstrates strong recommendation performance across both public and proprietary datasets, while preserving the text understanding of the pretrained model.</p></details> |  |

The cold start problem is a common issue in recommender systems, and many methods have been proposed to address the problem on the service provider's side. However, when the service provider does not take action, users are left with poor recommendations and no means to improve their experience. We propose an algorithm, Pretender, that allows end users to proactively solve the cold start problem on their own. Pretender does not require any special support from the service provider and can be deployed independently by users. We formulate the problem as minimizing the distance between the source and target distributions and optimize item selection from the target service accordingly. Furthermore, we establish theoretical guarantees for Pretender based on a discrete quadrature problem. We conduct experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of Pretender.</p></details> | TMLR 2025 |

To address this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation, proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware video generation and broader applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sihuiji.github.io/PhysMaster-Page/</p></details> |

To this end, we introduce GRALE, a novel graph autoencoder that encodes and decodes graphs of varying sizes into a shared embedding space. GRALE is trained using an Optimal Transport-inspired loss that compares the original and reconstructed graphs and leverages a differentiable node matching module, which is trained jointly with the encoder and decoder. The proposed attention-based architecture relies on Evoformer, the core component of AlphaFold, which we extend to support both graph encoding and decoding. We show, in numerical experiments on simulated and molecular data, that GRALE enables a highly general form of pre-training, applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks, from classification and regression to more complex tasks such as graph interpolation, editing, matching, and prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Predictive Representations for Combinatorial Generalization in Behavioral Cloning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10137v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally correlated states are properly encoded to similar latent representations, then the out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. We formalize this notion by demonstrating how encouraging long-range temporal consistency via successor representations (SR) can facilitate generalization. We then propose a simple yet effective representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ for GCBC, which theoretically approximates the successor representation in the finite MDP case through self-predictive representations, and achieves competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSL4Eco: A Global Seasonal Dataset for Geospatial Foundation Models in Ecology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18256v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the exacerbation of the biodiversity and climate crises, macroecological pursuits such as global biodiversity mapping become more urgent. Remote sensing offers a wealth of Earth observation data for ecological studies, but the scarcity of labeled datasets remains a major challenge. Recently, self-supervised learning has enabled learning representations from unlabeled data, triggering the development of pretrained geospatial models with generalizable features. However, these models are often trained on datasets biased toward areas of high human activity, leaving entire ecological regions underrepresented. Additionally, while some datasets attempt to address seasonality through multi-date imagery, they typically follow calendar seasons rather than local phenological cycles. To better capture vegetation seasonality at a global scale, we propose a simple phenology-informed sampling strategy and introduce corresponding SSL4Eco, a multi-date Sentinel-2 dataset, on which we train an existing model with a season-contrastive objective. We compare representations learned from SSL4Eco against other datasets on diverse ecological downstream tasks and demonstrate that our straightforward sampling method consistently improves representation quality, highlighting the importance of dataset construction. The model pretrained on SSL4Eco reaches state of the art performance on 7 out of 8 downstream tasks spanning (multi-label) classification and regression. We release our code, data, and model weights to support macroecological and computer vision research at https://github.com/PlekhanovaElena/ssl4eco.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, EarthVision workshop</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model. Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Simple Framework for Open-Vocabulary Zero-Shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16085v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot classification capabilities naturally arise in models trained within a vision-language contrastive framework. Despite their classification prowess, these models struggle in dense tasks like zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation. This deficiency is often attributed to the absence of localization cues in captions and the intertwined nature of the learning process, which encompasses both image representation learning and cross-modality alignment. To tackle these issues, we propose SimZSS, a Simple framework for open-vocabulary Zero-Shot Segmentation. The method is founded on two key principles: i) leveraging frozen vision-only models that exhibit spatial awareness while exclusively aligning the text encoder and ii) exploiting the discrete nature of text and linguistic knowledge to pinpoint local concepts within captions. By capitalizing on the quality of the visual representations, our method requires only image-caption pairs datasets and adapts to both small curated and large-scale noisy datasets. When trained on COCO Captions across 8 GPUs, SimZSS achieves state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 8 benchmark datasets in less than 15 minutes.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Most existing deep learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals, neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding 97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94, demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework. Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately 58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Generalizing WiFi Gesture Recognition via Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13390v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios. Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0 benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world AIoT applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ICPADS 2025</p></details> |

This separation hinders the joint representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing, we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data, particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models (MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing audio representations neglect this embodied dimension, limiting their ability to capture rhythmic and structural cues that drive movement. We propose MotionBeat, a framework for motion-aligned music representation learning. MotionBeat is trained with two newly proposed objectives: the Embodied Contrastive Loss (ECL), an enhanced InfoNCE formulation with tempo-aware and beat-jitter negatives to achieve fine-grained rhythmic discrimination, and the Structural Rhythm Alignment Loss (SRAL), which ensures rhythm consistency by aligning music accents with corresponding motion events. Architecturally, MotionBeat introduces bar-equivariant phase rotations to capture cyclic rhythmic patterns and contact-guided attention to emphasize motion events synchronized with musical accents. Experiments show that MotionBeat outperforms state-of-the-art audio encoders in music-to-dance generation and transfers effectively to beat tracking, music tagging, genre and instrument classification, emotion recognition, and audio-visual retrieval.

| **[A Matter of Representation: Towards Graph-Based Abstract Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13163v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most large language models (LLMs) today excel at generating raw, sequential code with minimal abstractions and custom structures. However, there has been little work on graph-based abstract code generation, where significant logic is encapsulated in predefined nodes and execution flow is determined by edges. This is relevant for visual programming languages, and in cases where raw source code is inaccessible to users and LLM training sets. In this work, we propose and evaluate JSON representations for graphs to enable high accuracy graph-based abstract code generation. We evaluate these representations on ScratchTest, a mini-benchmark based on our custom Python re-implementation of Scratch, which tests the LLM in code graph space. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can indeed perform the aforementioned generation task in a single pass without relying on specialized or complex pipelines, given the correct graph representations. We also show that different representations induce significantly different accuracies, highlighting the instrumental role of representations in this generation task. All in all, this work establishes the first steps towards representation learning for graph-based abstract code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAIL-Embedding Technical Report: Omni-modal Embedding Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12709v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal embedding models aim to yield informative unified representations that empower diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite promising developments in the evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support, unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning. Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.5% in the Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.1% AUC gain.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[TMT: Cross-domain Semantic Segmentation with Region-adaptive Transferability Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05774v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced semantic segmentation performance. However, their adaptation to new target domains remains challenged by distribution shifts, which often disrupt global attention mechanisms. While existing global and patch-level adaptation methods offer some improvements, they overlook the spatially varying transferability inherent in different image regions. To address this, we propose the Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a region-adaptive framework designed to enhance cross-domain representation learning through transferability guidance. First, we dynamically partition the image into coherent regions, grouped by structural and semantic similarity, and estimates their domain transferability at a localized level. Then, we incorporate region-level transferability maps directly into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, allowing the model to adaptively focus attention on areas with lower transferability and higher semantic uncertainty. Extensive experiments across 20 diverse cross-domain settings demonstrate that TMT not only mitigates the performance degradation typically associated with domain shift but also consistently outperforms existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage Brain-to-Population Graph Learning (B2P-GL) framework that integrates the semantic similarity of brain regions and condition-based population graph modeling. In the first stage, termed brain representation learning, we leverage brain atlas knowledge from GPT-4 to enrich the graph representation and refine the brain graph through an adaptive node reassignment graph attention network. In the second stage, termed population disorder diagnosis, phenotypic data is incorporated into population graph construction and feature fusion to mitigate confounding effects and enhance diagnosis performance. Experiments on the ABIDE I, ADHD-200, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets show that B2P-GL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy while enhancing interpretability. Overall, our proposed framework offers a reliable and personalized approach to brain disorder diagnosis, advancing clinical applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>this ...</summary><p>this paper has been submitted for possible publication</p></details> |

Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM) centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i) multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and multimodal biosignal integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Shapes Koopman Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13025v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community. However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning, where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma: constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive. Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast, expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel multimodal Explainable AI (XAI) framework that unifies attention-augmented feature fusion, Grad-CAM++-based local explanations, and a Reveal-to-Revise feedback loop for bias detection and mitigation. Evaluated on multimodal extensions of MNIST, our approach achieves 93.2% classification accuracy, 91.6% F1-score, and 78.1% explanation fidelity (IoU-XAI), outperforming unimodal and non-explainable baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that integrating interpretability with bias-aware learning enhances robustness and human alignment.

| **[FedGTEA: Federated Class-Incremental Learning with Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12927v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning, called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings, aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting, consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriveVLA-W0: World Models Amplify Data Scaling Law in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12796v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However, VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose \textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment. We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a 680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fast Coarse-graining and Equation Discovery with Foundation Inference Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12618v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g., the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple, simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Representations through Heterogeneous Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05108v4)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating heterogeneous representations from different architectures has facilitated various vision tasks, e.g., some hybrid networks combine transformers and convolutions. However, complementarity between such heterogeneous architectures has not been well exploited in self-supervised learning. Thus, we propose Heterogeneous Self-Supervised Learning (HSSL), which enforces a base model to learn from an auxiliary head whose architecture is heterogeneous from the base model. In this process, HSSL endows the base model with new characteristics in a representation learning way without structural changes. To comprehensively understand the HSSL, we conduct experiments on various heterogeneous pairs containing a base model and an auxiliary head. We discover that the representation quality of the base model moves up as their architecture discrepancy grows. This observation motivates us to propose a search strategy that quickly determines the most suitable auxiliary head for a specific base model to learn and several simple but effective methods to enlarge the model discrepancy. The HSSL is compatible with various self-supervised methods, achieving superior performances on various downstream tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection.

| **[LayerSync: Self-aligning Intermediate Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12581v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient, plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at https://github.com/vita-epfl/LayerSync.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Design in Nanophotonics via Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00546v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact, latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management, geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints, and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.</p></details> |  |

SPECTRUM comprises three core components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration. (3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

However, high-dimensional embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements, thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression (SMEC). This framework introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation Learning(SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings. Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance. For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025</p></details> |
| **[Riemannian generative decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19133v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Riemannian representation learning typically relies on an encoder to estimate densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing numerically brittle objectives, potentially harming model training and quality. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce the Riemannian generative decoder, a unifying approach for finding manifold-valued latents on any Riemannian manifold. Latents are learned with a Riemannian optimizer while jointly training a decoder network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds. We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure. Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures, and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

| **[A Hierarchical Quantized Tokenization Framework for Task-Adaptive Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12369v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in language and vision foundation models demonstrates the importance of discrete token interfaces that transform complex inputs into compact sequences for large-scale modeling. Extending this paradigm to graphs requires a tokenization scheme that handles non-Euclidean structures and multi-scale dependencies efficiently. Existing approaches to graph tokenization, linearized, continuous, and quantized, remain limited in adaptability and efficiency. In particular, most current quantization-based tokenizers organize hierarchical information in fixed or task-agnostic ways, which may either over-represent or under-utilize structural cues, and lack the ability to dynamically reweight contributions from different levels without retraining the encoder. This work presents a hierarchical quantization framework that introduces a self-weighted mechanism for task-adaptive aggregation across multiple scales. The proposed method maintains a frozen encoder while modulating information flow through a lightweight gating process, enabling parameter-efficient adaptation to diverse downstream tasks. Experiments on benchmark datasets for node classification and link prediction demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines under comparable computational budgets.</p></details> |  |

We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep" analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, 17 pages appendix (excluding references)</p></details> |

By integrating large language models (LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs, offering valuable insights for improving their resilience.

| **[DE3S: Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning for Medical Early Time-Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12214v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units (ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens, and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies confirming component efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE BIBM 2025</p></details> |
| **[SDGraph: Multi-Level Sketch Representation Learning by Sparse-Dense Graph Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12192v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Freehand sketches exhibit unique sparsity and abstraction, necessitating learning pipelines distinct from those designed for images. For sketch learning methods, the central objective is to fully exploit the effective information embedded in sketches. However, there is limited research on what constitutes effective sketch information, which in turn constrains the performance of existing approaches. To tackle this issue, we first proposed the Multi-Level Sketch Representation Scheme to systematically identify the effective information. The scheme organizes sketch representation into three levels: sketch-level, stroke-level, and point-level. This design is based on the granularity of analytical elements, from coarse (sketch-level) to fine (point-level), thereby ensuring more comprehensive coverage of the sketch information. For each level, we conducted theoretical analyses and experimental evaluations to identify and validate the effective information. Building on the above studies, we developed SDGraph, a deep learning architecture designed to exploit the identified effective information across the three levels. SDGraph comprises two complementary modules: a Sparse Graph that treats strokes as nodes for sketch-level and stroke-level representation learning, and a Dense Graph that treats points as nodes for sketch-level and point-level representation learning. Both modules employ graph convolution along with down-sampling and up-sampling operations, enabling them to function as both encoder and decoder. Besides that, an information fusion module bridges the two graphs to further enhance feature extraction. SDGraph supports a wide range of sketch-related downstream tasks, achieving accuracy improvements of 1.15\% and 1.70\% over the state-of-the-art in classification and retrieval, respectively, and 36.58\% improvement in vector sketch generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRL: Discriminative Representation Learning with Parallel Adapters for Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12107v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs), remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference phases.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Can Representation Gaps Be the Key to Enhancing Robustness in Graph-Text Alignment?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12087v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrates structural connectivity with rich textual semantics, enabling applications in diverse domains. Current methods largely rely on contrastive learning to maximize cross-modal similarity, assuming tighter coupling between graph and text representations improves transfer performance. However, our empirical analysis reveals that both natural gap expansion and forced gap reduction result in performance degradation by disrupting pre-trained knowledge structures and impairing generalization. This arises from the geometric incompatibility between encoders, where graph encoders capture topological patterns, while text encoders capture semantic structures. Over-alignment compresses these distinct spaces into shared subspaces, causing structure collapse that diminishes both topological reasoning and semantic understanding. We propose \textbf{LLM4GTA}, a gap-aware alignment framework that preserves representation gaps as geometric necessities for maintaining modality-specific knowledge and improving transfer performance. LLM4GTA includes an adaptive gap preservation module to prevent over-alignment by monitoring similarity evolution and an intra-modal compensation mechanism that boosts discriminative power using auxiliary classifiers in graph space. Extensive experiments show significant improvements over existing methods in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MEASURE: Multi-scale Minimal Sufficient Representation Learning for Domain Generalization in Sleep Staging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12070v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS, our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods.

In this work, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a series of versatile and compact embedding models, systematically incentivizing advanced embedding capability in LLMs by superior training techniques and high-quality data. For model architecture, we implement the models on a 0.5B compact size with simple mean-pooling to produce fixed-length embeddings and remove the causal attention mask to enable fully bidirectional representation learning. For training techniques, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline: pre-training on weakly supervised large-scale datasets, fine-tuning with supervised high-quality datasets, and contrastive distillation with fine-grained soft signals, integrated with focal-style reweighting and online hard-negative mixing to emphasize difficult samples and enrich hard negatives, respectively. For training data, we curate over 20 categories for pre-training and 100 categories for fine-tuning and contrastive distillation, to improve both performance and generalization, leveraging task-specific instructions, hard-negative mining, and example-based multi-class labeling to ensure high quality. Combining these techniques, our KaLM-Embedding-V2 series achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark, outperforming models of comparable size and rivaling models 3-26x larger, setting a new standard for versatile and compact embedding models under 1B parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 16 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

Among various recommendation methodologies, graph-based approaches have garnered attention by effectively exploiting the structural characteristics inherent in scholarly networks. However, these methods often overlook the asymmetric academic influence that is prevalent in scholarly networks when learning graph representations. To address this limitation, this study proposes the Mutual-Influence-Aware Recommendation (MIARec) model, which employs a gravity-based approach to measure the mutual academic influence between scholars and incorporates this influence into the feature aggregation process during message propagation in graph representation learning. Additionally, the model utilizes a multi-channel aggregation method to capture both individual embeddings of distinct single relational sub-networks and their interdependent embeddings, thereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous scholarly network. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that the MIARec model outperforms baseline models across three primary evaluation metrics, indicating its effectiveness in scientific paper recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, they often produce biased predictions caused by sensitive attributes, such as religion or gender, an issue that has been largely overlooked in existing methods. Recently, numerous studies have focused on reducing biases in GNNs. However, these approaches often rely on training with partial data (e.g., using either node features or graph structure alone), which can enhance fairness but frequently compromises model utility due to the limited utilization of available graph information. To address this tradeoff, we propose an effective strategy to balance fairness and utility in knowledge distillation. Specifically, we introduce FairDTD, a novel Fair representation learning framework built on Dual-Teacher Distillation, leveraging a causal graph model to guide and optimize the design of the distillation process. Specifically, FairDTD employs two fairness-oriented teacher models: a feature teacher and a structure teacher, to facilitate dual distillation, with the student model learning fairness knowledge from the teachers while also leveraging full data to mitigate utility loss. To enhance information transfer, we incorporate graph-level distillation to provide an indirect supplement of graph information during training, as well as a node-specific temperature module to improve the comprehensive transfer of fair knowledge. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairDTD achieves optimal fairness while preserving high model utility, showcasing its effectiveness in fair representation learning for GNNs.</p></details> |  |

While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

While Knowledge Components (KCs) provide a foundation for such modeling, automated KC extraction from student code is inherently challenging due to insufficient explainability of discovered KCs and the open-endedness of programming problems with significant structural variability across student solutions and complex interactions among programming concepts. In this work, we propose a novel, explainable framework for automated KC discovery through pattern-based KCs: recurring structural patterns within student code that capture the specific programming patterns and language constructs that students must master. Toward this, we train a Variational Autoencoder to generate important representative patterns from student code guided by an explainable, attention-based code representation model that identifies important correct and incorrect pattern implementations from student code. These patterns are then clustered to form pattern-based KCs. We evaluate our KCs using two well-established methods informed by Cognitive Science: learning curve analysis and Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). Experimental results demonstrate meaningful learning trajectories and significant improvements in DKT predictive performance over traditional KT methods. This work advances knowledge modeling in CS education by providing an automated, scalable, and explainable framework for identifying granular code patterns and algorithmic constructs, essential for student learning.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS) tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000} of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable supervised fine-tuning of classification models.

To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles, facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance accessibility and encourage research.

This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities. Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL), showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding capabilities.

| **[Query-Specific GNN: A Comprehensive Graph Representation Learning Method for Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11541v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources. However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network (QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at: https://github.com/Jerry2398/QSGNN.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, despite their superior performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters and inference time.</p></details> |  |

Yet, while self-supervised speech representation learning from raw waveforms has been remarkably successful, these approaches have not achieved similar feats for general-purpose audio representation learning from waveforms. Here, we propose WavJEPA, a waveform-based version of the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture. WavJEPA leverages high-level semantic representation learning to tackle the shortcomings of representation learning at the speech unit or token level. We show that this approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art time-domain audio foundation models across a wide variety of downstream benchmark tasks, while requiring considerably fewer computational resources. Additionally, to overcome the performance drop that time-domain models typically exhibit in noisy and reverberant real-world acoustic environments, we present WavJEPA-Nat. WavJEPA-Nat is a multi-channel extension of the WavJEPA architecture trained on simulated naturalistic scenes. We find that WavJEPA-Nat is highly robust to reverberation and noise. These results highlight the feasibility and computational efficiency of general-purpose audio representation learning from raw waveforms, showcasing the potential for low-latency, robust time-domain audio foundation models for real-world applications.</p></details> | Still under review |

We present a self-supervised framework for learning hierarchical manipulation concepts that encode these invariant patterns through cross-modal sensory correlations and multi-level temporal abstractions without requiring human annotation. Our approach combines a cross-modal correlation network that identifies persistent patterns across sensory modalities with a multi-horizon predictor that organizes representations hierarchically across temporal scales. Manipulation concepts learned through this dual structure enable policies to focus on transferable relational patterns while maintaining awareness of both immediate actions and longer-term goals. Empirical evaluation across simulated benchmarks and real-world deployments demonstrates significant performance improvements with our concept-enhanced policies. Analysis reveals that the learned concepts resemble human-interpretable manipulation primitives despite receiving no semantic supervision. This work advances both the understanding of representation learning for manipulation and provides a practical approach to enhancing robotic performance in complex scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Shared Representations from Unpaired Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21524v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning shared representations is a primary area of multimodal representation learning. The current approaches to achieve a shared embedding space rely heavily on paired samples from each modality, which are significantly harder to obtain than unpaired ones. In this work, we demonstrate that shared representations can be learned almost exclusively from unpaired data. Our arguments are grounded in the spectral embeddings of the random walk matrices constructed independently from each unimodal representation. Empirical results in computer vision and natural language processing domains support its potential, revealing the effectiveness of unpaired data in capturing meaningful cross-modal relations, demonstrating high capabilities in retrieval tasks, generation, arithmetics, zero-shot, and cross-domain classification. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate these capabilities almost exclusively from unpaired samples, giving rise to a cross-modal embedding that could be viewed as universal, i.e., independent of the specific modalities of the data.

| **[Enhancing Self-Supervised Learning with Semantic Pairs A New Dataset and Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08722v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning paradigm wherein individual instances within a dataset are treated as distinct classes. This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance by applying stochastic transformations, encouraging the model to learn representations invariant to the common underlying object across these views. While this approach facilitates the acquisition of invariant representations for dataset instances under various handcrafted transformations (e.g., random cropping, colour jittering), an exclusive reliance on such data transformations for achieving invariance may inherently limit the model's generalizability to unseen datasets and diverse downstream tasks. The inherent limitation stems from the fact that the finite set of transformations within the data processing pipeline is unable to encompass the full spectrum of potential data variations. In this study, we provide the technical foundation for leveraging semantic pairs to enhance the generalizability of the model's representation and empirically demonstrate that incorporating semantic pairs mitigates the issue of limited transformation coverage. Specifically, we propose that by exposing the model to semantic pairs (i.e., two instances belonging to the same semantic category), we introduce varied real-world scene contexts, thereby fostering the development of more generalizable object representations. To validate this hypothesis, we constructed and released a novel dataset comprising curated semantic pairs and conducted extensive experimentation to empirically establish that their inclusion enables the model to learn more general representations, ultimately leading to improved performance across diverse downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Representation Regularization for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01711v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning, while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen, through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Causal Disentanglement Learning for Accurate Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11084v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the root causes of anomalies.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 Figures, |

However, existing approaches typically adopt modality-centric modeling strategies that process ID-based and multimodal embeddings independently, failing to capture fine-grained interactions between content semantics and behavioral signals. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Multimodal Fusion (DMF), which introduces a modality-enriched modeling strategy to enable fine-grained interactions between ID-based collaborative representations and multimodal representations for user interest modeling. Specifically, we construct target-aware features to bridge the semantic gap across different embedding spaces and leverage them as side information to enhance the effectiveness of user interest modeling. Furthermore, we design an inference-optimized attention mechanism that decouples the computation of target-aware features and ID-based embeddings before the attention layer, thereby alleviating the computational bottleneck introduced by incorporating target-aware features. To achieve comprehensive multimodal integration, DMF combines user interest representations learned under the modality-centric and modality-enriched modeling strategies. Offline experiments on public and industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DMF. Moreover, DMF has been deployed on the product recommendation system of the international e-commerce platform Lazada, achieving relative improvements of 5.30% in CTCVR and 7.43% in GMV with negligible computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

We present InstructUE, an instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations. InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space, thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Diffusion Models with Flexible Representation Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08980v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image, protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in $23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA.

| **[Unify Variables in Neural Scaling Laws for General Audio Representations via Embedding Effective Rank](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10948v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling laws have profoundly shaped our understanding of model performance in computer vision and natural language processing, yet their application to general audio representation learning remains underexplored. A key challenge lies in the multifactorial nature of general audio representation-representation quality is jointly influenced by variables such as audio length, embedding dimensionality, model depth, model architecture, data volume, etc., many of which are difficult to isolate or express analytically. In this work, we present a systematic study of scaling laws for general audio representations by utilizing embedding effective rank (RankMe) as a unifying metric that encapsulates the impact of diverse variables on representation quality. RankMe enables a label-free, information-theoretic quantification of audio embeddings, allowing us to examine scaling behaviors across a wide hyper-parameter space, including model size, training data volume, computational budget, architectural configurations, etc. Our empirical findings reveal a consistent power-law relationship between RankMe and representation quality, suggesting that embedding effective rank serves as a reliable proxy for assessing and predicting model performance in audio representation learning. This work not only validates the applicability of classical scaling principles to the general audio domain but also offers a theoretically grounded and empirically robust framework for guiding future model scaling strategies in audio foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[GapDNER: A Gap-Aware Grid Tagging Model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10927v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In biomedical fields, one named entity may consist of a series of non-adjacent tokens and overlap with other entities. Previous methods recognize discontinuous entities by connecting entity fragments or internal tokens, which face challenges of error propagation and decoding ambiguity due to the wide variety of span or word combinations. To address these issues, we deeply explore discontinuous entity structures and propose an effective Gap-aware grid tagging model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition, named GapDNER. Our GapDNER innovatively applies representation learning on the context gaps between entity fragments to resolve decoding ambiguity and enhance discontinuous NER performance. Specifically, we treat the context gap as an additional type of span and convert span classification into a token-pair grid tagging task. Subsequently, we design two interactive components to comprehensively model token-pair grid features from both intra- and inter-span perspectives. The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine mechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of each span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes criss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At the inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each entity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all valid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that our GapDNER achieves new state-of-the-art performance on discontinuous NER and exhibits remarkable advantages in recognizing complex entity structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological alignment into representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |

Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space. To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as high ID classification accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

To leverage knowledge from large-scale pretraining, prior work has typically built generalist policies either on top of vision-language understanding models (VLMs) or generative models. However, both semantic understanding from vision-language pretraining and visual dynamics modeling from visual-generation pretraining are crucial for embodied robots. Recent unified models of generation and understanding have demonstrated strong capabilities in both comprehension and generation through large-scale pretraining. We posit that robotic policy learning can likewise benefit from the combined strengths of understanding, planning and continuous future representation learning. Building on this insight, we introduce UniCoD, which acquires the ability to dynamically model high-dimensional visual features through pretraining on over 1M internet-scale instructional manipulation videos. Subsequently, UniCoD is fine-tuned on data collected from the robot embodiment, enabling the learning of mappings from predictive representations to action tokens. Extensive experiments show our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of 9\% and 12\% across simulation environments and real-world out-of-distribution tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings. To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices in contrastive learning.

Content-based sequential recommendation has recently emerged as a promising direction that exploits items' textual and visual features to enhance preference learning. However, there are still three key challenges: (i) how to reduce the semantic gap between different content modality representations; (ii) how to jointly model user behavior preferences and content preferences; and (iii) how to design an effective training strategy to align ID representations and content representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model, self-supervised representation learning with ID-Content modality alignment, named SICSRec. Firstly, we propose a LLM-driven sample construction method and develop a supervised fine-tuning approach to align item-level modality representations. Secondly, we design a novel Transformer-based sequential model, where an ID-modality sequence encoder captures user behavior preferences, a content-modality sequence encoder learns user content preferences, and a mix-modality sequence decoder grasps the intrinsic relationship between these two types of preferences. Thirdly, we propose a two-step training strategy with a content-aware contrastive learning task to align modality representations and ID representations, which decouples the training process of content modality dependency and item collaborative dependency. Extensive experiments conducted on four public video streaming datasets demonstrate our SICSRec outperforms the state-of-the-art ID-modality sequential recommenders and content-modality sequential recommenders by 8.04% on NDCG@5 and 6.62% on NDCD@10 on average, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Unlike standard GNNs that rely on shallow, fixed-hop aggregation, DRTR leverages both static preprocessing and dynamic resampling to capture deeper structural dependencies. A \emph{Distance Recomputator} prunes semantically weak edges using adaptive attention, while a \emph{Topology Reconstructor} establishes latent connections among distant but relevant nodes. This joint mechanism enables more expressive and robust representation learning across evolving graph structures.

COSINE exploits foundation models to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies, divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved generalization over single-modality approaches.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |
| **[Mesh-Gait: A Unified Framework for Gait Recognition Through Multi-Modal Representation Learning from 2D Silhouettes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10406v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers, and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

However, in real deployment, feature distribution changes may degrade the performance of AI models and lead to undesired behaviors. To counter for undetected model degradation, we propose ALERT; a method that can detect feature distribution changes and trigger model re-training that works well on two wireless network use cases: wireless fingerprinting and link anomaly detection. ALERT includes three components: representation learning, statistical testing and utility assessment. We rely on MLP for designing the representation learning component, on Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Population Stability Index tests for designing the statistical testing and a new function for utility assessment. We show the superiority of the proposed method against ten standard drift detection methods available in the literature on two wireless network use cases.</p></details> |  |

A recent empirical study finds that the high-quality representation aligns with the key token of the input text, uncovering the potential connection between representation space and vocabulary space. Inspired by the findings, we revisit the generative tasks and develop an unsupervised generative framework for TRL, Text2Token. The framework is based on the token target prediction task, utilizing carefully constructed target token distribution as supervisory signals. To construct the high-quality target token distribution, we analyze the token-alignment properties with advanced embedders and identify two essential categories of key tokens: (1) the meaningful tokens in the text and (2) semantically derived tokens beyond the text. Based on these insights, we propose two methods -- data-driven and model-derived -- to construct synthetic token targets from data or the LLM backbone. Experiments on the MTEB v2 benchmark demonstrate that Text2Token achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art embedder with unsupervised contrastive learning, LLM2Vec.

| **[PANTHER: Generative Pretraining Beyond Language for Sequential User Behavior Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10102v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown that generative pretraining can distill vast world knowledge into compact token representations. While LLMs encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference. PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1 gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable, high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative Pseudo Labeling for Unsupervised Federated Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10100v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP) have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative \underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}). Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to baseline methods.

| **[Latent Reasoning via Sentence Embedding Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22202v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive language models (LMs) generate one token at a time, yet human reasoning operates over higher-level abstractions - sentences, propositions, and concepts. This contrast raises a central question- Can LMs likewise learn to reason over structured semantic units rather than raw token sequences? In this work, we investigate whether pretrained LMs can be lifted into such abstract reasoning spaces by building on their learned representations. We present a framework that adapts a pretrained token-level LM to operate in sentence space by autoregressively predicting continuous embeddings of next sentences. We explore two embedding paradigms inspired by classical representation learning: 1) semantic embeddings, learned via autoencoding to preserve surface meaning; and 2) contextual embeddings, trained via next-sentence prediction to encode anticipatory structure. We evaluate both under two inference regimes: Discretized, which decodes each predicted embedding into text before re-encoding; and Continuous, which reasons entirely in embedding space for improved efficiency. Across four domains - mathematics, logic, commonsense, and planning - contextual embeddings under continuous inference show competitive performance with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while reducing inference-time FLOPs on average by half. We also present early signs of scalability and modular adaptation. Finally, to visualize latent trajectories, we introduce SentenceLens, a diagnostic tool that decodes intermediate model states into interpretable sentences. Together, our results indicate that pretrained LMs can effectively transition to abstract, structured reasoning within latent embedding spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Previ...</summary><p>Previously titled "Let's Predict Sentence by Sentence"; Presented @ COLM RAM 2 Workshop (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Translution: Unifying Self-attention and Convolution for Adaptive and Relative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10060v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words) to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively. Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast, convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper, we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named {\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution) achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at https://github.com/hehefan/Translution.</p></details> | technical report |

Analysis and Ingredients for Mutual Information Skill Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08021v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has the potential of lifting several of the key challenges in reinforcement learning today, such as exploration, representation learning, and reward design. Recent work (METRA) has effectively argued that moving away from mutual information and instead optimizing a certain Wasserstein distance is important for good performance. In this paper, we argue that the benefits seen in that paper can largely be explained within the existing framework of mutual information skill learning (MISL). Our analysis suggests a new MISL method (contrastive successor features) that retains the excellent performance of METRA with fewer moving parts, and highlights connections between skill learning, contrastive representation learning, and successor features. Finally, through careful ablation studies, we provide further insight into some of the key ingredients for both our method and METRA.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 (Oral < 1.8%).

Among them, the AlphaEarth Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that integrate both physical form and functional meaning.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAWRMAC: A Novel Dynamic Graph Representation Learning Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09884v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graph representation learning has become essential for analyzing evolving networks in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and traffic analysis. However, existing continuous-time methods face three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations. Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable, generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning.

The method, called *temporal lifting*, introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow architectures used in AI systems.

By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS, MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton, Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This work advances scalable HAB monitoring in label-scarce environments while enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic biogeochemistry.</p></details> |  |

In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is capable of combining temperature information from different molecular simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.</p></details> |  |
| **[HeSRN: Representation Learning On Heterogeneous Graphs via Slot-Aware Retentive Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09767v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Shared Prototypes for a Multimodal Pulse Motion Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09764v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA, and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives, resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model with ProtoMM and demonstrate that our approach outperforms contrastive-only and prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while offering improved interpretability of learned features.</p></details> |  |
| **[STaTS: Structure-Aware Temporal Sequence Summarization via Statistical Window Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09593v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness, and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+ datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30 archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity, demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware time series modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Orthogonal Representation Learning for Estimating Causal Quantities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04274v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end representation learning has become a powerful tool for estimating causal quantities from high-dimensional observational data, but its efficiency remained unclear. Here, we face a central tension: End-to-end representation learning methods often work well in practice but lack asymptotic optimality in the form of the quasi-oracle efficiency. In contrast, two-stage Neyman-orthogonal learners provide such a theoretical optimality property but do not explicitly benefit from the strengths of representation learning. In this work, we step back and ask two research questions: (1) When do representations strengthen existing Neyman-orthogonal learners? and (2) Can a balancing constraint - commonly proposed technique in the representation learning literature - provide improvements to Neyman-orthogonality? We address these two questions through our theoretical and empirical analysis, where we introduce a unifying framework that connects representation learning with Neyman-orthogonal learners (namely, OR-learners). In particular, we show that, under the low-dimensional manifold hypothesis, the OR-learners can strictly improve the estimation error of the standard Neyman-orthogonal learners. At the same time, we find that the balancing constraint requires an additional inductive bias and cannot generally compensate for the lack of Neyman-orthogonality of the end-to-end approaches. Building on these insights, we offer guidelines for how users can effectively combine representation learning with the classical Neyman-orthogonal learners to achieve both practical performance and theoretical guarantees.</p></details> |  |

Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks: causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning abilities of LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025 Main)</p></details> |
| **[What Do Temporal Graph Learning Models Learn?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09416v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density, temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Receiver Generalization for RF Fingerprint Identification via Feature Disentanglement and Adversarial Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09405v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver, as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (BMSE) and balanced softmax cross-entropy (BSCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the $R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification.

However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery, particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals. Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models.

Spoofing, one of the most covert and deceptive TBM strategies, exhibits complex anomaly patterns across multilevel prices, while often being simplified as a single-level manipulation. These patterns are usually concealed within the rich, hierarchical information of the Limit Order Book (LOB), which is challenging to leverage due to high dimensionality and noise. To address this, we propose a representation learning framework combining a cascaded LOB representation architecture with supervised contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently improves detection performance across diverse models, with Transformer-based architectures achieving state-of-the-art results. In addition, we conduct systematic analyses and ablation studies to investigate multilevel manipulation and the contributions of key components for detection, offering broader insights into representation learning and anomaly detection for complex time series data.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a two-step approach to enhance the robustness and generalization of speech emotion recognition models through improved representation learning. First, our model employs EDRL (Emotion-Disentangled Representation Learning) to extract class-specific discriminative features while preserving shared similarities across emotion categories. Next, MEA (Multiblock Embedding Alignment) refines these representations by projecting them into a joint discriminative latent subspace that maximizes covariance with the original speech input. The learned EDRL-MEA embeddings are subsequently used to train an emotion classifier using clean samples from publicly available datasets, and are evaluated on unseen noisy and cross-corpus speech samples. Improved performance under these challenging conditions demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 13 pages, 1 figure |

| **[Progressive Uncertainty-Guided Evidential U-KAN for Trustworthy Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08949v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthy medical image segmentation aims at deliver accurate and reliable results for clinical decision-making. Most existing methods adopt the evidence deep learning (EDL) paradigm due to its computational efficiency and theoretical robustness. However, the EDL-based methods often neglect leveraging uncertainty maps rich in attention cues to refine ambiguous boundary segmentation. To address this, we propose a progressive evidence uncertainty guided attention (PEUA) mechanism to guide the model to focus on the feature representation learning of hard regions. Unlike conventional approaches, PEUA progressively refines attention using uncertainty maps while employing low-rank learning to denoise attention weights, enhancing feature learning for challenging regions. Concurrently, standard EDL methods suppress evidence of incorrect class indiscriminately via Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization, impairing the uncertainty assessment in ambiguous areas and consequently distorts the corresponding attention guidance. We thus introduce a semantic-preserving evidence learning (SAEL) strategy, integrating a semantic-smooth evidence generator and a fidelity-enhancing regularization term to retain critical semantics. Finally, by embedding PEUA and SAEL with the state-of-the-art U-KAN, we proposes Evidential U-KAN, a novel solution for trustworthy medical image segmentation.

However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family (e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP, which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the $\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the embedding space.</p></details> | 23 pages |

In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via extensive experiments.

| **[From Moments to Models: Graphon Mixture-Aware Mixup and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03690v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graph datasets often consist of mixtures of populations, where graphs are generated from multiple distinct underlying distributions. However, modern representation learning approaches, such as graph contrastive learning (GCL) and augmentation methods like Mixup, typically overlook this mixture structure. In this work, we propose a unified framework that explicitly models data as a mixture of underlying probabilistic graph generative models represented by graphons. To characterize these graphons, we leverage graph moments (motif densities) to cluster graphs arising from the same model. This enables us to disentangle the mixture components and identify their distinct generative mechanisms. This model-aware partitioning benefits two key graph learning tasks: 1) It enables a graphon-mixture-aware mixup (GMAM), a data augmentation technique that interpolates in a semantically valid space guided by the estimated graphons, instead of assuming a single graphon per class. 2) For GCL, it enables model-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally, by introducing a new model-aware objective, our proposed approach (termed MGCL) improves negative sampling by restricting negatives to graphs from other models. We establish a key theoretical guarantee: a novel, tighter bound showing that graphs sampled from graphons with small cut distance will have similar motif densities with high probability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong empirical performance. In unsupervised learning, MGCL achieves state-of-the-art results, obtaining the top average rank across eight datasets. In supervised learning, GMAM consistently outperforms existing strategies, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in 6 out of 7 datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, an overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image and audio.

The substantial computational demands required for training conventional CL frameworks pose a set of challenges, particularly in terms of energy consumption, data availability, and memory usage. We conduct an evaluation of four widely used CL frameworks: SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow Twins. We focus on the practical feasibility of these CL frameworks for edge and fog deployment, and introduce a systematic benchmarking strategy that includes energy profiling and reduced training data conditions. Our findings reveal that SimCLR, contrary to its perceived computational cost, demonstrates the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes. Finally, we also extend our analysis by evaluating lightweight neural architectures when paired with CL frameworks. Our study aims to provide insights into the resource implications of deploying CL in edge/fog environments with limited processing capabilities and opens several research directions for its future optimization.</p></details> |  |

Generic embedding models often struggle to represent telecom-specific semantics, limiting their utility in retrieval and downstream tasks. We present T-VEC (Telecom Vectorization Model), a domain-adapted embedding model fine-tuned from the gte-Qwen2-1.5B-instruct backbone using a triplet loss objective. Fine-tuning was performed on T-Embed, a high-quality, large-scale dataset covering diverse telecom concepts, standards, and operational scenarios. Although T-Embed contains some proprietary material and cannot be fully released, we open source 75% of the dataset to support continued research in domain-specific representation learning. On a custom benchmark comprising 1500 query-passage pairs from IETF RFCs and vendor manuals, T-VEC surpasses MPNet, BGE, Jina and E5, demonstrating superior domain grounding and semantic precision in telecom-specific retrieval. Embedding visualizations further showcase tight clustering of telecom-relevant concepts. We release T-VEC and its tokenizer to support semantically faithful NLP applications within the telecom domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Industry Track)</p></details> |

Although humans can solve these tasks with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges. Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First, the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework, called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over 10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku and Maze tasks over the recent advances.</p></details> |  |

The general chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT) significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes. Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference in industrial drug discovery workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphTARIF: Linear Graph Transformer with Augmented Rank and Improved Focus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10631v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However, existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map. Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.</p></details> |  |

However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Functional awareness Transformer-based graph archetype contrastive learning for Decoding Visual Neural Representations from EEG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24761v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a formidable challenge due to their high-dimensional, noisy, and non-Euclidean nature. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG) framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics. To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more generalizable and robust neural representations.</p></details> |  |

A Unified Empirical Study on Atomistic Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05583v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN - that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model development.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 8 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Quantifying Long-Range Interactions in Graph Machine Learning: a Large Graph Dataset and a Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09008v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-range dependencies are critical for effective graph representation learning, yet most existing datasets focus on small graphs tailored to inductive tasks, offering limited insight into long-range interactions. Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city road networks. This dataset features graphs with over 100k nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs based on local node eccentricities, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement-particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution-which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Inferring Pluggable Types with Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15676v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pluggable type systems allow programmers to extend the type system of a programming language to enforce semantic properties defined by the programmer. Pluggable type systems are difficult to deploy in legacy codebases because they require programmers to write type annotations manually. This paper investigates how to use machine learning to infer type qualifiers automatically. We propose a novel representation, NaP-AST, that encodes minimal dataflow hints for the effective inference of type qualifiers. We evaluate several model architectures for inferring type qualifiers, including Graph Transformer Network, Graph Convolutional Network and Large Language Model. We further validated these models by applying them to 12 open-source programs from a prior evaluation of the NullAway pluggable typechecker, lowering warnings in all but one unannotated project. We discovered that GTN shows the best performance, with a recall of .89 and precision of 0.6. Furthermore, we conduct a study to estimate the number of Java classes needed for good performance of the trained model. For our feasibility study, performance improved around 16k classes, and deteriorated due to overfitting around 22k classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Representation of Stiffened Panels with Non-Uniform Boundary Conditions and Loads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02472v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surrogate models are essential in structural analysis and optimization. We propose a heterogeneous graph representation of stiffened panels that accounts for geometrical variability, non-uniform boundary conditions, and diverse loading scenarios, using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The structure is partitioned into multiple structural units, such as stiffeners and the plates between them, with each unit represented by three distinct node types: geometry, boundary, and loading nodes. Edge heterogeneity is introduced by incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting nodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees of heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are implemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises stress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and degrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams composed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The heterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart, demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, an ablation analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of graph heterogeneity on HGT performance. The results show strong predictive accuracy for both displacement and von Mises stress, effectively capturing structural behavior patterns and maximum values.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint and has been submitted to Engineering with Computers</p></details> |

These reviews pose significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets, a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era.

This paper presents the first attempt to estimate 3D human body mesh from sparse LiDAR point clouds. We found that the major challenge in estimating human pose and mesh from point clouds lies in the sparsity, noise, and incompletion of LiDAR point clouds. Facing these challenges, we propose an effective sparse-to-dense reconstruction scheme to reconstruct 3D human mesh. This involves estimating a sparse representation of a human (3D human pose) and gradually reconstructing the body mesh. To better leverage the 3D structural information of point clouds, we employ a cascaded graph transformer (graphormer) to introduce point cloud features during sparse-to-dense reconstruction. Experimental results on three publicly available databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

First-principles approaches are accurate but computationally intensive. Recent years, machine learning (ML) has been extensively applied to this field, while existing ML models predominantly focus on band gap predictions or indirect band structure estimation via solving predicted Hamiltonians. An end-to-end model to predict band structure accurately and efficiently is still lacking. Here, we introduce a graph Transformer-based end-to-end approach that directly predicts band structures from crystal structures with high accuracy. Our method leverages the continuity of the k-path and treat continuous bands as a sequence. We demonstrate that our model not only provides accurate band structure predictions but also can derive other properties (such as band gap, band center, and band dispersion) with high accuracy. We verify the model performance on large and diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Integrated Multimodal Concept Bottleneck Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00701v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning. MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEIST: A Graph Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics and Proteomics Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11152v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics have become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and gene expression at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Graph Neural Networks are Incomplete on Graphs with a Simple Spectrum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05530v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet, these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on graphs from ZINC.</p></details> | 10 pages main text |
| **[AI-Enhanced Multi-Dimensional Measurement of Technological Convergence through Heterogeneous Graph and Semantic Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21187v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technological convergence refers to the phenomenon where boundaries between technological areas and disciplines are increasingly blurred. It enables the integration of previously distinct domains and has become a mainstream trend in today's innovation process. However, accurately measuring technological convergence remains a persistent challenge due to its inherently multidimensional and evolving nature. This study designs an Technological Convergence Index (TCI) that comprehensively measures convergence along two fundamental dimensions: depth and breadth. For depth calculation, we use IPC textual descriptions as the analytical foundation and enhance this assessment by incorporating supplementary patent metadata into a heterogeneous graph structure. This graph is then modeled using Heterogeneous Graph Transformers in combination with Sentence-BERT, enabling a precise representation of knowledge integration across technological boundaries. Complementing this, the breadth dimension captures the diversity of technological fields involved, quantified through the Shannon Diversity Index to measure the variety of technological combinations within patents. Our final TCI is constructed using the Entropy Weight Method, which objectively assigns weights to both dimensions based on their information entropy. To validate our approach, we compare the proposed TCI against established convergence measures, demonstrating its comparative advantages. We further establish empirical reliability through a novel robustness test that regresses TCI against indicators of patent quality. These findings are further substantiated through comprehensive robustness checks. Our multidimensional approach provides valuable practical insights for innovation policy and industry strategies in managing emerging cross-domain technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphUniverse: Enabling Systematic Evaluation of Inductive Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21097v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph, transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure. Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at https://graphuniverse.streamlit.app.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Graph-Transformer Out-of-Distribution Generalization Abilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20575v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID) benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts. Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without specialized DG algorithms (on four out of six benchmarks). Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets, specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Highlighting its model-agnostic design, the method yielded valuable insights into both GT and MPNN backbones and appears well suited for broader DG applications beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.</p></details> |  |

Accurate classification of ncRNAs is essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis. To address existing limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion, we propose HGMamba-ncRNA, a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model, which integrates sequence, secondary structure, and optionally available expression features of ncRNAs to enhance classification performance. Specifically, the sequence of ncRNA is modeled using a parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM architecture (MKC-L) to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies of nucleotides. The structure modality employs a multi-scale graph transformer (MSGraphTransformer) to represent the multi-level topological characteristics of ncRNA secondary structures. The expression modality utilizes a Chebyshev Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CPKAN) to effectively model and interpret high-dimensional expression profiles. Finally, by incorporating virtual nodes to facilitate efficient and comprehensive multimodal interaction, HyperGraphMamba is proposed to adaptively align and integrate multichannel heterogeneous modality features. Experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Extensive empirical studies further confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong transferability, offering a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA functional classification. Code and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HGMamba-ncRNA-94D0.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 17 figures (including subfigures), 1 table.

| **[Local equivalence of stabilizer states: a graphical characterisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20183v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stabilizer states form a ubiquitous family of quantum states that can be graphically represented through the graph state formalism. A fundamental property of graph states is that applying a local complementation - a well-known and extensively studied graph transformation - results in a graph that represents the same entanglement as the original. In other words, the corresponding graph states are LU-equivalent. This property served as the cornerstone for capturing non-trivial quantum properties in a simple graphical manner, in the study of quantum entanglement but also for developing protocols and models based on graph states and stabilizer states, such as measurement-based quantum computing, secret sharing, error correction, entanglement distribution... However, local complementation fails short to fully characterise entanglement: there exist pairs of graph states that are LU-equivalent but cannot be transformed one into the other using local complementations. Only few is known about the equivalence of graph states beyond local complementation. We introduce a generalisation of local complementation which graphically characterises the LU-equivalence of graph states. We use this characterisation to show the existence of a strict infinite hierarchy of equivalences of graph states. Our approach is based on minimal local sets, which are subsets of vertices that are known to cover any graph, and to be invariant under local complementation and even LU-equivalence. We use these structures to provide a type to each vertex of a graph, leading to a natural standard form in which the LU-equivalence can be exhibited and captured by means of generalised local complementation.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method, IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology. The code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IPGPhormer-6EEB.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

We present SolarCAST, a causally informed model predicting future global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a target site using only historical GHI from site X and nearby stations S - unlike prior work that relies on sky-camera or satellite imagery requiring specialized hardware and heavy preprocessing. To deliver high accuracy with only public sensor data, SolarCAST models three classes of confounding factors behind X-S correlations using scalable neural components: (i) observable synchronous variables (e.g., time of day, station identity), handled via an embedding module; (ii) latent synchronous factors (e.g., regional weather patterns), captured by a spatio-temporal graph neural network; and (iii) time-lagged influences (e.g., cloud movement across stations), modeled with a gated transformer that learns temporal shifts. It outperforms leading time-series and multimodal baselines across diverse geographical conditions, and achieves a 25.9% error reduction over the top commercial forecaster, Solcast. SolarCAST offers a lightweight, practical, and generalizable solution for localized solar forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2025</p></details> |

The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer, featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping linear complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12694v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural architecture designed for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages with 3 figures and 2 tables, submitted to IEEE for a possible publication</p></details> |
| **[State Space Models over Directed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13735v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed graphs are ubiquitous across numerous domains, where the directionality of edges encodes critical causal dependencies. However, existing GNNs and graph Transformers tailored for directed graphs face two major challenges: (1) effectively capturing long-range causal dependencies derived from directed edges; (2) balancing accuracy and training efficiency when processing large-scale graph datasets. In recent years, state space models (SSMs) have achieved substantial progress in causal sequence tasks, and their variants designed for graphs have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining high efficiency across various graph learning benchmarks. However, existing graph state space models are exclusively designed for undirected graphs, which limits their performance in directed graph learning. To this end, we propose an innovative approach DirEgo2Token which sequentializes directed graphs via k-hop ego graphs. This marks the first systematic extension of state space models to the field of directed graph learning. Building upon this, we develop DirGraphSSM, a novel directed graph neural network architecture that implements state space models on directed graphs via the message-passing mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that DirGraphSSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three representative directed graph learning tasks while attaining competitive performance on two additional tasks with 1.5$\times $ to 2$\times $ training speed improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently undergoing review by IEEE Transactions on Big Data</p></details> |

Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approaches typically formulate ARE as a sequential decision-making problem defined on a collision-free informative graph. However, these methods often demonstrate limited reasoning ability over graph-structured data. Moreover, due to the insufficient consideration of robot motion, the resulting RL policies are generally optimized to minimize travel distance, while neglecting time efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRATE, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approach that leverages a Graph Transformer to effectively capture both local structure patterns and global contextual dependencies of the informative graph, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning capability across the entire environment. In addition, we deploy a Kalman filter to smooth the waypoint outputs, ensuring that the resulting path is kinodynamically feasible for the robot to follow. Experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits better exploration efficiency (up to 21.5% in distance and 21.3% in time to complete exploration) than state-of-the-art conventional and learning-based baselines in various simulation benchmarks. We also validate our planner in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Homophily Booster: Rethinking the Role of Discrete Features on Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12530v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs.</p></details> | 14 pages |

In this work, we design and benchmark an NQS impurity solver for the quantum embedding methods, focusing on the ghost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA) framework. We introduce a graph transformer-based NQS framework able to represent arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and develop an error control mechanism to stabilise iterative updates throughout the quantum embedding loops. We validate the accuracy of our approach with benchmark gGA calculations of the Anderson Lattice Model, yielding results in excellent agreement with the exact diagonalisation impurity solver. Finally, our analysis of the computational budget reveals the method's principal bottleneck to be the high-accuracy sampling of physical observables required by the embedding loop, rather than the NQS variational optimisation, directly highlighting the critical need for more efficient inference techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, and 4 figures.

| **[GTHNA: Local-global Graph Transformer with Memory Reconstruction for Holistic Node Anomaly Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10869v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in graph-structured data is an inherently challenging problem, as it requires the identification of rare nodes that deviate from the majority in both their structural and behavioral characteristics. Existing methods, such as those based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), often suffer from over-smoothing, which causes the learned node representations to become indistinguishable. Furthermore, graph reconstruction-based approaches are vulnerable to anomalous node interference during the reconstruction process, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a novel and holistic anomaly evaluation framework that integrates three key components: a local-global Transformer encoder, a memory-guided reconstruction mechanism, and a multi-scale representation matching strategy. These components work synergistically to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and global structural dependencies, suppress the influence of anomalous nodes, and assess anomalies from multiple levels of granularity. Anomaly scores are computed by combining reconstruction errors and memory matching signals, resulting in a more robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering a comprehensive and generalizable solution for anomaly detection across various graph domains.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Database Views as Explanations for Relational Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09482v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash, Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSRFormer: Road Network Representation Learning using Multi-scale Feature Fusion of Heterogeneous Spatial Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05685v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer, MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections, which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow heterogeneity of spatial interactions.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective cross-lingual generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Found...</summary><p>Found some issues and need to correct them</p></details> |

However, in tasks involving natural language and programming language (NL-PL) artifacts, relying solely on textual similarity is limited by their semantic gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical evaluation across various types of TLR tasks, revealing the limitations of textual similarity in NL-PL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an approach that incorporates multiple domain-specific auxiliary strategies, identified through empirical analysis, into two models: the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via edge types and the prompt-based Gemini 2.5 Pro via additional input information. We then evaluated our approach using the widely studied requirements-to-code TLR task, a representative case of NL-PL TLR. Experimental results show that both the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models outperformed their original counterparts without strategy integration. Furthermore, compared to the current state-of-the-art method HGNNLink, the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models achieved average F1-score improvements of 3.68% and 8.84%, respectively, across twelve open-source projects, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy integration in enhancing overall model performance for the requirements-code TLR task.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 5 images, 11 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |

While traditional machine learning (ML) approaches are widely used, they struggle to capture spatial dependencies and poor boundary delineation between susceptibility classes. This study introduces the first application of a graph transformer (GT) architecture for flood susceptibility mapping to the flood-prone French Riviera (e.g., 2020 Storm Alex) using topography, hydrology, geography, and environmental data. GT incorporates watershed topology using Laplacian positional encoders (PEs) and attention mechanisms. The developed GT model has an AUC-ROC (0.9739), slightly lower than XGBoost (0.9853). However, the GT model demonstrated better clustering and delineation with a higher Moran's I value (0.6119) compared to the random forest (0.5775) and XGBoost (0.5311) with p-value lower than 0.0001. Feature importance revealed a striking consistency across models, with elevation, slope, distance to channel, and convergence index being the critical factors. Dimensionality reduction on Laplacian PEs revealed partial clusters, indicating they could capture spatial information; however, their importance was lower than flood factors. Since climate and land use changes aggravate flood risk, susceptibility maps are developed for the 2050 year under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and railway track vulnerability is assessed. All RCP scenarios revealed increased area across susceptibility classes, except for the very low category. RCP 8.5 projections indicate that 17.46% of the watershed area and 54% of railway length fall within very-high susceptible zones, compared to 6.19% and 35.61%, respectively, under current conditions. The developed maps can be integrated into a multi-hazard framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained, local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance. Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.</p></details> |  |

Graph Transformers (GTs) mitigate this via global self-attention, yet their quadratic cost in the number of nodes limits scalability. We propose Graph Elimination Networks (GENs), an MPNN variant that approximates GT-like long-range modeling while maintaining high efficiency. GENs combine edge-wise and hop-wise self-attention in parallel; their multiplicative composition yields an attention kernel separable across edge and hop factors within a bounded K-hop receptive field. To enable hop-wise attention, we introduce the Graph Elimination Algorithm (GEA), which prevents double counting across hops, ensuring that each round injects the k-hop incremental contribution exactly once. Taking differences between successive rounds recovers the k-hop increment and yields disentangled multi-hop features as inputs for hop-wise attention. This preserves clearer structural distinctions across hop distances and enables more faithful modeling of pairwise dependencies between distant nodes within the K-hop neighborhood. On the Long-Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB), GENs outperform strong MPNN baselines by 7.7 and 6.0 percentage points (pp) on PascalVOC-SP and COCO-SP, and achieve performance on par with or better than state-of-the-art Graph Transformers. On OGBN-Products, GENs support full-batch training/inference, while sparse-attention baselines like Exphormer struggle with memory limits under comparable budgets, highlighting GENs as a practical alternative for large, sparse graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inclu...</summary><p>Includes 11 pages of main text and 6 pages of appendices</p></details> |

Graph transformers have become increasingly important in graph learning for their ability to utilize long-range node communication explicitly, addressing limitations such as oversmoothing and oversquashing found in message-passing graph networks. However, their dense attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of nodes, limiting their applicability to large-scale graphs. ReHub draws inspiration from the airline industry's hub-and-spoke model, where flights are assigned to optimize operational efficiency. In our approach, graph nodes (spokes) are dynamically reassigned to a fixed number of virtual nodes (hubs) at each model layer. Recent work, Neural Atoms (Li et al., 2024), has demonstrated impressive and consistent improvements over GNN baselines by utilizing such virtual nodes; their findings suggest that the number of hubs strongly influences performance. However, increasing the number of hubs typically raises complexity, requiring a trade-off to maintain linear complexity. Our key insight is that each node only needs to interact with a small subset of hubs to achieve linear complexity, even when the total number of hubs is large. To leverage all hubs without incurring additional computational costs, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive reassignment technique based on hub-hub similarity scores, eliminating the need for expensive node-hub computations. Our experiments on LRGB indicate a consistent improvement in results over the base method, Neural Atoms, while maintaining a linear complexity. Remarkably, our sparse model achieves performance on par with its non-sparse counterpart. Furthermore, ReHub outperforms competitive baselines and consistently ranks among top performers across various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025.

These architectures have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size, adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller. The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while having a similar training speed.

In addition, we incorporate molecular fingerprints as a complementary modality and introduce a mechanism of interaction between attention to adaptively fuse information across representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MLFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both classification and regression tasks. Interpretability analysis further reveals that the model effectively captures task-relevant chemical patterns, supporting the usefulness of multi-level and multi-modal fusion in molecular representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Graph Transformers: A Comparative Study of Sparse and Dense Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17175v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs have become a central representation in machine learning for capturing relational and structured data across various domains. Traditional graph neural networks often struggle to capture long-range dependencies between nodes due to their local structure. Graph transformers overcome this by using attention mechanisms that allow nodes to exchange information globally. However, there are two types of attention in graph transformers: dense and sparse. In this paper, we compare these two attention mechanisms, analyze their trade-offs, and highlight when to use each. We also outline current challenges and problems in designing attention for graph transformers.</p></details> |  |
| **[DegDiT: Controllable Audio Generation with Dynamic Event Graph Guided Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13786v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable text-to-audio generation aims to synthesize audio from textual descriptions while satisfying user-specified constraints, including event types, temporal sequences, and onset and offset timestamps. This enables precise control over both the content and temporal structure of the generated audio. Despite recent progress, existing methods still face inherent trade-offs among accurate temporal localization, open-vocabulary scalability, and practical efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose DegDiT, a novel dynamic event graph-guided diffusion transformer framework for open-vocabulary controllable audio generation. DegDiT encodes the events in the description as structured dynamic graphs. The nodes in each graph are designed to represent three aspects: semantic features, temporal attributes, and inter-event connections. A graph transformer is employed to integrate these nodes and produce contextualized event embeddings that serve as guidance for the diffusion model. To ensure high-quality and diverse training data, we introduce a quality-balanced data selection pipeline that combines hierarchical event annotation with multi-criteria quality scoring, resulting in a curated dataset with semantic diversity. Furthermore, we present consensus preference optimization, facilitating audio generation through consensus among multiple reward signals. Extensive experiments on AudioCondition, DESED, and AudioTime datasets demonstrate that DegDiT achieves state-of-the-art performances across a variety of objective and subjective evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreqDGT: Frequency-Adaptive Dynamic Graph Networks with Transformer for Cross-subject EEG Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22807v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a reliable and objective signal for emotion recognition in affective brain-computer interfaces, offering unique advantages through its high temporal resolution and ability to capture authentic emotional states that cannot be consciously controlled. However, cross-subject generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to individual variability, cognitive traits, and emotional responses. We propose FreqDGT, a frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer that systematically addresses these limitations through an integrated framework. FreqDGT introduces frequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant frequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic graph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and implements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines hierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to capture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of integrating frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical modeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences.

Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived graph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or anomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805 without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches. With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to 0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.</p></details> |  |

However, searching for prior art is challenging due to the large number of patent documents and the need for nuanced comparisons to determine novelty. An accurate search engine is therefore invaluable for speeding up the process. We present a Graph Transformer-based dense retrieval method for patent searching where each invention is represented by a graph describing its features and their relationships. Our model processes these invention graphs and is trained using prior art citations from patent office examiners as relevance signals. Using graphs as input significantly improves the computational efficiency of processing long documents, while leveraging examiner citations allows the model to learn domain-specific similarities beyond simple text-based matching. The result is a search engine that emulates how professional patent examiners identify relevant documents. We compare our approach against publicly available text embedding models and show substantial improvements in both prior art retrieval quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the PatentSemTech 2025 workshop, held in conjunction with SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a graph neural network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity. Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation. To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Omics Analysis for Cancer Subtype Inference via Unrolling Graph Smoothness Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06257v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating multi-omics datasets through data-driven analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of the complex biological processes underlying various diseases, particularly cancer. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently demonstrated remarkable ability to exploit relational structures in biological data, enabling advances in multi-omics integration for cancer subtype classification. Existing approaches often neglect the intricate coupling between heterogeneous omics, limiting their capacity to resolve subtle cancer subtype heterogeneity critical for precision oncology. To address these limitations, we propose a framework named Graph Transformer for Multi-omics Cancer Subtype Classification (GTMancer). This framework builds upon the GNN optimization problem and extends its application to complex multi-omics data. Specifically, our method leverages contrastive learning to embed multi-omics data into a unified semantic space. We unroll the multiplex graph optimization problem in that unified space and introduce dual sets of attention coefficients to capture structural graph priors both within and among multi-omics data. This approach enables global omics information to guide the refining of the representations of individual omics. Empirical experiments on seven real-world cancer datasets demonstrate that GTMancer outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Bottleneck-Guided Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Interpretable Neurodevelopmental Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20769v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing interpretable models for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) diagnosis presents significant challenges in effectively encoding, decoding, and integrating multimodal neuroimaging data. While many existing machine learning approaches have shown promise in brain network analysis, they typically suffer from limited interpretability, particularly in extracting meaningful biomarkers from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and establishing clear relationships between imaging features and demographic characteristics. Besides, current graph neural network methodologies face limitations in capturing both local and global functional connectivity patterns while simultaneously achieving theoretically principled multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a unified framework that applies information bottleneck principles to guide both brain connectivity modeling and cross-modal feature integration. This framework comprises two complementary components. The first is the Information Bottleneck Graph Transformer (IBGraphFormer), which combines transformer-based global attention mechanisms with graph neural networks through information bottleneck-guided pooling to identify sufficient biomarkers. The second is the Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (IB-HGAN), which employs meta-path-based heterogeneous graph learning with structural consistency constraints to achieve interpretable fusion of neuroimaging and demographic data. The experimental results demonstrate that I2B-HGNN achieves superior performance in diagnosing NDDs, exhibiting both high classification accuracy and the ability to provide interpretable biomarker identification while effectively analyzing non-imaging data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual Graph Transformer: A Small Language Model for Enhanced Engineering Document Information Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02532v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text, often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering. CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram, and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical domains often require specialized language models with stronger contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7% higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented responses in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Generative Modeling of Grounded Scene Graphs and Images via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01130v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a framework for joint grounded scene graph - image generation, a challenging task involving high-dimensional, multi-modal structured data. To effectively model this complex joint distribution, we adopt a factorized approach: first generating a grounded scene graph, followed by image generation conditioned on the generated grounded scene graph. While conditional image generation has been widely explored in the literature, our primary focus is on the generation of grounded scene graphs from noise, which provides efficient and interpretable control over the image generation process. This task requires generating plausible grounded scene graphs with heterogeneous attributes for both nodes (objects) and edges (relations among objects), encompassing continuous attributes (e.g., object bounding boxes) and discrete attributes (e.g., object and relation categories). To address this challenge, we introduce DiffuseSG, a novel diffusion model that jointly models the heterogeneous node and edge attributes. We explore different encoding strategies to effectively handle the categorical data. Leveraging a graph transformer as the denoiser, DiffuseSG progressively refines grounded scene graph representations in a continuous space before discretizing them to generate structured outputs. Additionally, we introduce an IoU-based regularization term to enhance empirical performance. Our model outperforms existing methods in grounded scene graph generation on the VG and COCO-Stuff datasets, excelling in both standard and newly introduced metrics that more accurately capture the task's complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the broader applicability of DiffuseSG in two important downstream tasks: 1) achieving superior results in a range of grounded scene graph completion tasks, and 2) enhancing grounded scene graph detection models by leveraging additional training samples generated by DiffuseSG.</p></details> |  |

We study the expressive power of graph transformers (GTs) by Dwivedi and Bresson (2020) and GPS-networks by Ramp\'asek et al. (2022), both under soft-attention and average hard-attention. Our study covers two scenarios: the theoretical setting with real numbers and the more practical case with floats. With reals, we show that in restriction to vertex properties definable in first-order logic (FO), GPS-networks have the same expressive power as graded modal logic (GML) with the global modality. With floats, GPS-networks turn out to be equally expressive as GML with the counting global modality. The latter result is absolute, not restricting to properties definable in a background logic. We also obtain similar characterizations for GTs in terms of propositional logic with the global modality (for reals) and the counting global modality (for floats).</p></details> |  |
| **[Invariant Graph Transformer for Out-of-Distribution Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00304v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated great effectiveness across various graph analytical tasks. However, the existing GTs focus on training and testing graph data originated from the same distribution, but fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Graph invariant learning, aiming to capture generalizable graph structural patterns with labels under distribution shifts, is potentially a promising solution, but how to design attention mechanisms and positional and structural encodings (PSEs) based on graph invariant learning principles remains challenging. To solve these challenges, we introduce Graph Out-Of-Distribution generalized Transformer (GOODFormer), aiming to learn generalized graph representations by capturing invariant relationships between predictive graph structures and labels through jointly optimizing three modules. Specifically, we first develop a GT-based entropy-guided invariant subgraph disentangler to separate invariant and variant subgraphs while preserving the sharpness of the attention function. Next, we design an evolving subgraph positional and structural encoder to effectively and efficiently capture the encoding information of dynamically changing subgraphs during training. Finally, we propose an invariant learning module utilizing subgraph node representations and encodings to derive generalizable graph representations that can to unseen graphs. We also provide theoretical justifications for our method. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using weakest application conditions to rank graph transformations for graph repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08788v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When using graphs and graph transformations to model systems, consistency is an important concern. While consistency has primarily been viewed as a binary property, i.e., a graph is consistent or inconsistent with respect to a set of constraints, recent work has presented an approach to consistency as a graduated property. This allows living with inconsistencies for a while and repairing them when necessary. For repairing inconsistencies in a graph, we use graph transformation rules with so-called {\em impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions} to understand how much repair gain certain rule applications would bring. Both types of conditions can be derived from given graph constraints. Our main theorem shows that the difference between the number of actual constraint violations before and after a graph transformation step can be characterized by the difference between the numbers of violated impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions. This theory forms the basis for algorithms with look-ahead that rank graph transformations according to their potential for graph repair. An evaluation shows that graph repair can be well supported by rules with these new types of application conditions in terms of effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 25 Figures, new, more efficient method for constructing application conditions, theoretical comparison to other concepts of consistency, extended evaluation</p></details> |

Traditional OCD methods can be broadly divided into node clustering and link clustering approaches, both of which rely solely on link information to identify overlapping communities. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have made significant advancements for this task. However, existing GNN-based approaches often face difficulties in effectively integrating link, attribute, and prior information, along with challenges like limited receptive fields and over-smoothing, which hinder their performance on complex overlapping community detection. In this paper, we propose a Weak-clique based Overlapping Community Detection method, namely WOCD, which incorporates prior information and optimizes the use of link information to improve detection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce pseudo-labels within a semi-supervised framework to strengthen the generalization ability, making WOCD more versatile. Furthermore, we initialize pseudo-labels using weak cliques to fully leverage link and prior information, leading to better detection accuracy. Additionally, we employ a single-layer Graph Transformer combined with GNN, which achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining efficiency. We evaluate WOCD on eight real-world attributed datasets, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised OCD method by a significant margin in terms of accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Obfuscation: Cluster-Aware Graph with LLM-Aided Recovery for Malicious JavaScript Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22447v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid expansion of web-based applications and cloud services, malicious JavaScript code continues to pose significant threats to user privacy, system integrity, and enterprise security. But, detecting such threats remains challenging due to sophisticated code obfuscation techniques and JavaScript's inherent language characteristics, particularly its nested closure structures and syntactic flexibility. In this work, we propose DeCoda, a hybrid defense framework that combines large language model (LLM)-based deobfuscation with code graph learning: (1) We first construct a sophisticated prompt-learning pipeline with multi-stage refinement, where the LLM progressively reconstructs the original code structure from obfuscated inputs and then generates normalized Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representations; (2) In JavaScript ASTs, dynamic typing scatters semantically similar nodes while deeply nested functions fracture scope capturing, introducing structural noise and semantic ambiguity. To address these challenges, we then propose to learn hierarchical code graph representations via a Cluster-wise Graph that synergistically integrates graph transformer network, node clustering, and node-to-cluster attention to simultaneously capture both local node-level semantics and global cluster-induced structural relationships from AST graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves F1-scores of 94.64% and 97.71% on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating absolute improvements of 10.74% and 13.85% over state-of-the-art baselines. In false-positive control evaluation at fixed FPR levels (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01), our approach delivers 4.82, 5.91, and 2.53 higher TPR respectively compared to the best-performing baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-based deobfuscation and underscore the importance of modeling cluster-level relationships in detecting malicious code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rule-Based Graph Programs Matching the Time Complexity of Imperative Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09144v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on recent advances in rule-based graph programming, which allow us to match the time complexity of some fundamental imperative graph algorithms. In general, achieving the time complexity of graph algorithms implemented in conventional languages using a rule-based graph-transformation language is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be implemented in the graph programming language GP 2 such that their runtime matches the time complexity of imperative implementations. However, this required input graphs to have a bounded node degree and (for some algorithms) to be connected. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies: the first program checks whether input graphs are connected, the second program checks whether input graphs are acyclic, and the third program solves the single-source shortest-paths problem for graphs with integer edge-weights. The first two programs run in linear time on (possibly disconnected) input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. The third program runs in time $O(nm)$ on arbitrary input graphs, matching the time complexity of imperative implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. For each program, we formally prove its correctness and time complexity, and provide runtime experiments on various graph classes.</p></details> |  |

This study systematically benchmarked classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN)) for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data. This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version; a revised version will be uploaded later</p></details> |

However, the dynamic traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various real-world traffic networks.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges such as over-smoothing and over-compression remain when handling large-scale and complex graph datasets, leading to a decline in clustering quality. Although the Graph Transformer architecture has mitigated some of these issues, its performance is still limited when processing heterogeneous graph data. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep clustering framework that comprising GCN, Autoencoder (AE), and Graph Transformer, termed the Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network (Tri-GFN). This framework enhances the differentiation and consistency of global and local information through a unique tri-learning mechanism and feature fusion enhancement strategy. The framework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer modules. These components are meticulously fused by a triple-channel enhancement module, which maximizes the use of both node attributes and topological structures, ensuring robust clustering representation. The tri-learning mechanism allows mutual learning among these modules, while the feature fusion strategy enables the model to capture complex relationships, yielding highly discriminative representations for graph clustering. It surpasses many state-of-the-art methods, achieving an accuracy improvement of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14 % on the Reuters dataset, and 7.58 % on the USPS dataset. Due to its outstanding performance on the Reuters dataset, Tri-GFN can be applied to automatic news classification, topic retrieval, and related fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code for this study is available at https://github.com/YF-W/Tri-GFN</p></details> |

Here, we propose MGT, a multi-view graph transformer framework that synergistically fuses SE3 invariant and SO3 equivariant graph representations, which respectively captures rotation-translation invariance and rotation equivariance in crystal geometries. To strategically incorporate these complementary geometric representations, we employ a lightweight mixture of experts router in MGT to adaptively adjust the weight assigned to SE3 and SO3 embeddings based on the specific target task. Compared with previous state-of-the-art models, MGT reduces the mean absolute error by up to 21% on crystal property prediction tasks through multi-task self-supervised pretraining. Ablation experiments and interpretable investigations confirm the effectiveness of each technique implemented in our framework. Additionally, in transfer learning scenarios including crystal catalyst adsorption energy and hybrid perovskite bandgap prediction, MGT achieves performance improvements of up to 58% over existing baselines, demonstrating domain-agnostic scalability across diverse application domains. As evidenced by the above series of studies, we believe that MGT can serve as useful model for crystal material property prediction, providing a valuable tool for the discovery of novel materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taint Analysis for Graph APIs Focusing on Broken Access Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08947v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis for Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes in the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use critical pair analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the CPA is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>Intermediate preprint (revision #1) for submission to ICGT 24 Special Issue in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |

While it conventionally relies on meticulous feature engineering, deep learning techniques have recently shown a great promise in learning effective player and team representations directly for soccer outcome prediction. However, existing methods often overlook the heterogeneous nature of interactions among players and teams, which is crucial for accurately modeling match dynamics. To address this gap, we propose HIGFormer (Heterogeneous Interaction Graph Transformer), a novel graph-augmented transformer-based deep learning model for soccer outcome prediction. HIGFormer introduces a multi-level interaction framework that captures both fine-grained player dynamics and high-level team interactions. Specifically, it comprises (1) a Player Interaction Network, which encodes player performance through heterogeneous interaction graphs, combining local graph convolutions with a global graph-augmented transformer; (2) a Team Interaction Network, which constructs interaction graphs from a team-to-team perspective to model historical match relationships; and (3) a Match Comparison Transformer, which jointly analyzes both team and player-level information to predict match outcomes. Extensive experiments on the WyScout Open Access Dataset, a large-scale real-world soccer dataset, demonstrate that HIGFormer significantly outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we provide valuable insights into leveraging our model for player performance evaluation, offering a new perspective on talent scouting and team strategy analysis.</p></details> |  |

We present HedraRAG, a runtime system built on a graph-based abstraction that exposes optimization opportunities across stage-level parallelism, intra-request similarity, and inter-request skewness. These opportunities are realized through dynamic graph transformations, such as node splitting, reordering, edge addition, and dependency rewiring, applied to wavefronts of subgraphs spanning concurrent requests. The resulting execution plans are mapped onto hybrid CPU-GPU pipelines to improve resource utilization and reduce latency. Evaluations across a wide range of RAG workflows demonstrate speedups exceeding 1.5x and reaching up to 5x over existing frameworks, showcasing the effectiveness of coordinated generation and retrieval in serving environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SOSP 2025</p></details> |

These changes are inherently discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete spaces for reaction prediction.</p></details> | 22pages, 2 figures |

Radar sensors, capable of penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks, including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and effective approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)</p></details> |

We prepend a lightweight Riemannian mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold, mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure. These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space. Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured. Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making graph representations more interpretable.</p></details> |  |

However, training deep learning models for AMS designs is severely limited by the scarcity of integrated circuit design data. In this work, we present CircuitGPS, a few-shot learning method for parasitic effect prediction in AMS circuits. The circuit netlist is represented as a heterogeneous graph, with the coupling capacitance modeled as a link. CircuitGPS is pre-trained on link prediction and fine-tuned on edge regression. The proposed method starts with a small-hop sampling technique that converts a link or a node into a subgraph. Then, the subgraph embeddings are learned with a hybrid graph Transformer. Additionally, CircuitGPS integrates a low-cost positional encoding that summarizes the positional and structural information of the sampled subgraph. CircuitGPS improves the accuracy of coupling existence by at least 20\% and reduces the MAE of capacitance estimation by at least 0.067 compared to existing methods. Our method demonstrates strong inherent scalability, enabling direct application to diverse AMS circuit designs through zero-shot learning. Furthermore, the ablation studies provide valuable insights into graph models for representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of DAC2025</p></details> |

Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork) framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2) spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries. Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[NTSFormer: A Self-Teaching Graph Transformer for Multimodal Cold-Start Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04870v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because cold-start nodes are isolated (i.e., no edges) and often have missing modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However, this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student" prediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature data into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion. Experimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior performance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer and decouples dynamic-static objects optimization for 3D Gaussian Splatting-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarsegrained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. On the other hand, we decouple dynamic and static objects by leveraging semantic probability distributions and design a Dynamic-Static Decoupled Gaussian Attention mechanism to optimize the prediction performance for both dynamic objects and static scenes. GraphGSOcc achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, OpenOcc and KITTI occupancy benchmarks. Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 25.20%, reducing GPU memory to 6.8 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple Approximations for General Spanner Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23638v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider a graph with n nodes and m edges, independent edge weights and lengths, and arbitrary distance demands for node pairs. The spanner problem asks for a minimum-weight subgraph that satisfies these demands via sufficiently short paths w.r.t. the edge lengths. For multiplicative alpha-spanners (where demands equal alpha times the original distances) and assuming that each edge's weight equals its length, the simple Greedy heuristic by Alth\"ofer et al. (1993) is known to yield strong solutions, both in theory and practice. To obtain guarantees in more general settings, recent approximations typically abandon this simplicity and practicality. Still, so far, there is no known non-trivial approximation algorithm for the spanner problem in its most general form. We provide two surprisingly simple approximations algorithms. In general, our Augmented Greedy achieves the first unconditional approximation ratio of m, which is non-trivial due to the independence of weights and lengths. Crucially, it maintains all size and weight guarantees Greedy is known for, i.e., in the aforementioned multiplicative alpha-spanner scenario and even for additive +beta-spanners. Further, it generalizes some of these size guarantees to derive new weight guarantees. Our second approach, Randomized Rounding, establishes a graph transformation that allows a simple rounding scheme over a standard multicommodity flow LP. It yields an O(n log n)-approximation, assuming integer lengths and polynomially bounded distance demands. The only other known approximation guarantee in this general setting requires several complex subalgorithms and analyses, yet we match it up to a factor of O(n^{1/5-eps}) using standard tools. Further, on bounded-degree graphs, we yield the first O(log n) approximation ratio for constant-bounded distance demands (beyond multiplicative 2-spanners in unit-length graphs).</p></details> |  |
| **[FoGE: Fock Space inspired encoding for graph prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02937v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based structures effortlessly.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study of Dynamic Stock Relationship Modeling and S&P500 Price Forecasting Based on Differential Graph Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18717v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock price prediction is vital for investment decisions and risk management, yet remains challenging due to markets' nonlinear dynamics and time-varying inter-stock correlations. Traditional static-correlation models fail to capture evolving stock relationships. To address this, we propose a Differential Graph Transformer (DGT) framework for dynamic relationship modeling and price prediction. Our DGT integrates sequential graph structure changes into multi-head self-attention via a differential graph mechanism, adaptively preserving high-value connections while suppressing noise. Causal temporal attention captures global/local dependencies in price sequences. We further evaluate correlation metrics (Pearson, Mutual Information, Spearman, Kendall's Tau) across global/local/dual scopes as spatial-attention priors. Using 10 years of S&P 500 closing prices (z-score normalized; 64-day sliding windows), DGT with spatial priors outperformed GRU baselines (RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87). Kendall's Tau global matrices yielded optimal results (MAE: 0.11). K-means clustering revealed "high-volatility growth" and "defensive blue-chip" stocks, with the latter showing lower errors (RMSE: 0.13) due to stable correlations. Kendall's Tau and Mutual Information excelled in volatile sectors. This study innovatively combines differential graph structures with Transformers, validating dynamic relationship modeling and identifying optimal correlation metrics/scopes. Clustering analysis supports tailored quantitative strategies. Our framework advances financial time-series prediction through dynamic modeling and cross-asset interaction analysis.</p></details> |  |

We introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight, parameter-efficient foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being pre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong multimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a unified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models structural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph transformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful, modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification, prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our model revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a unique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration). BrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can surpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and powerful research in computational neuroscience.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

For non-Euclidean data, e.g., graphs, that particularly involves topological structures, one important aspect neglected by prior studies is how machine learning models generalize under topological shifts. This paper proposes Advective Diffusion Transformer (AdvDIFFormer), a physics-inspired graph Transformer model designed to address this challenge. The model is derived from advective diffusion equations which describe a class of continuous message passing process with observed and latent topological structures. We show that AdvDIFFormer has provable capability for controlling generalization error with topological shifts, which in contrast cannot be guaranteed by graph diffusion models, i.e., the generalized formulation of common graph neural networks in continuous space. Empirically, the model demonstrates superiority in various predictive tasks across information networks, molecular screening and protein interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, these methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules. Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |

Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities. Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal data, especially when accompanied with network structures.</p></details> |  |

GITO consists of two main modules: a hybrid graph transformer (HGT) and a transformer neural operator (TNO). HGT leverages a graph neural network (GNN) to encode local spatial relationships and a transformer to capture long-range dependencies. A self-attention fusion layer integrates the outputs of the GNN and transformer to enable more expressive feature learning on graph-structured data. TNO module employs linear-complexity cross-attention and self-attention layers to map encoded input functions to predictions at arbitrary query locations, ensuring discretization invariance and enabling zero-shot super-resolution across any mesh. Empirical results on benchmark PDE tasks demonstrate that GITO outperforms existing transformer-based neural operators, paving the way for efficient, mesh-agnostic surrogate solvers in engineering applications.</p></details> |  |

Existing research has leveraged text-attributed graphs (TAGs) to tackle the heterogeneity in node features among graphs. However, they primarily focus on homogeneous TAGs (HoTAGs), leaving heterogeneous TAGs (HeTAGs), where multiple types of nodes/edges reside, underexplored. To enhance the capabilities and applications of GFM, we introduce H$^2$GFM, a novel framework designed to generalize across both HoTAGs and HeTAGs. Our model projects diverse meta-relations among graphs under a unified textual space, and employs a context encoding to capture spatial and higher-order semantic relationships. To achieve robust node representations, we propose a novel context-adaptive graph transformer (CGT), effectively capturing information from both context neighbors and their relationships. Furthermore, we employ a mixture of CGT experts to capture the heterogeneity in structural patterns among graph types. Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of HoTAGs and HeTAGs as well as learning scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Efficient and Generalizable Graph Retriever for Knowledge-Graph Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09645v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong inductive reasoning ability across various domains, but their reliability is hindered by the outdated knowledge and hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these issues by grounding LLMs with external knowledge; however, most existing RAG pipelines rely on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and structured reasoning. Knowledge graphs, which represent facts as relational triples, offer a more structured and compact alternative. Recent studies have explored integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), with a significant proportion adopting the retrieve-then-reasoning paradigm. In this framework, graph-based retrievers have demonstrated strong empirical performance, yet they still face challenges in generalization ability. In this work, we propose RAPL, a novel framework for efficient and effective graph retrieval in KGQA. RAPL addresses these limitations through three aspects: (1) a two-stage labeling strategy that combines heuristic signals with parametric models to provide causally grounded supervision; (2) a model-agnostic graph transformation approach to capture both intra- and inter-triple interactions, thereby enhancing representational capacity; and (3) a path-based reasoning strategy that facilitates learning from the injected rational knowledge, and supports downstream reasoner through structured inputs. Empirically, RAPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by $2.66\%-20.34\%$, and significantly reduces the performance gap between smaller and more powerful LLM-based reasoners, as well as the gap under cross-dataset settings, highlighting its superior retrieval capability and generalizability.

| **[Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding for Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08309v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However, the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies. Also, L-STEP obtains the leading performance in the newest large-scale TGB benchmark.

| **[HGFormer: A Hierarchical Graph Transformer Framework for Two-Stage Colonel Blotto Games via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08580v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-stage Colonel Blotto game represents a typical adversarial resource allocation problem, in which two opposing agents sequentially allocate resources in a network topology across two phases: an initial resource deployment followed by multiple rounds of dynamic reallocation adjustments. The sequential dependency between game stages and the complex constraints imposed by the graph topology make it difficult for traditional approaches to attain a globally optimal strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical graph Transformer framework called HGformer. By incorporating an enhanced graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent hierarchical decision model, our approach enables efficient policy generation in large-scale adversarial environments. Moreover, we design a layer-by-layer feedback reinforcement learning algorithm that feeds the long-term returns from lower-level decisions back into the optimization of the higher-level strategy, thus bridging the coordination gap between the two decision-making stages. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing hierarchical decision-making or graph neural network methods, HGformer significantly improves resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, achieving superior overall performance in complex dynamic game scenarios.</p></details> |  |

| **[Quantum Graph Transformer for NLP Sentiment Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07937v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum machine learning is a promising direction for building more efficient and expressive models, particularly in domains where understanding complex, structured data is critical. We present the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a hybrid graph-based architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention mechanism into the message-passing framework for structured language modeling. The attention mechanism is implemented using parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), which enable the model to capture rich contextual relationships while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to classical attention mechanisms. We evaluate QGT on five sentiment classification benchmarks. Experimental results show that QGT consistently achieves higher or comparable accuracy than existing quantum natural language processing (QNLP) models, including both attention-based and non-attention-based approaches. When compared with an equivalent classical graph transformer, QGT yields an average accuracy improvement of 5.42% on real-world datasets and 4.76% on synthetic datasets. Additionally, QGT demonstrates improved sample efficiency, requiring nearly 50% fewer labeled samples to reach comparable performance on the Yelp dataset. These results highlight the potential of graph-based QNLP techniques for advancing efficient and scalable language understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Return of ChebNet: Understanding and Improving an Overlooked GNN on Long Range Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07624v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ChebNet, one of the earliest spectral GNNs, has largely been overshadowed by Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), which gained popularity for their simplicity and effectiveness in capturing local graph structure. Despite their success, MPNNs are limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies between nodes. This has led researchers to adapt MPNNs through rewiring or make use of Graph Transformers, which compromises the computational efficiency that characterized early spatial message-passing architectures, and typically disregards the graph structure. Almost a decade after its original introduction, we revisit ChebNet to shed light on its ability to model distant node interactions. We find that out-of-box, ChebNet already shows competitive advantages relative to classical MPNNs and GTs on long-range benchmarks, while maintaining good scalability properties for high-order polynomials. However, we uncover that this polynomial expansion leads ChebNet to an unstable regime during training. To address this limitation, we cast ChebNet as a stable and non-dissipative dynamical system, which we coin Stable-ChebNet. Our Stable-ChebNet model allows for stable information propagation, and has controllable dynamics which do not require the use of eigendecompositions, positional encodings, or graph rewiring. Across several benchmarks, Stable-ChebNet achieves near state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphGPT: Generative Pre-trained Graph Eulerian Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00529v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduceGraphGPT, a novel self-supervised generative pre-trained model for graph learning based on the Graph Eulerian Transformer (GET). First, we propose GET, which combines a standard transformer encoder or decoder architecture with an innovative graph-to-sequence transformation method. This method converts graphs or sampled subgraphs into sequences of tokens representing nodes, edges, and attributes in a reversible manner using Eulerian paths. We pre-train GET using either of the two self-supervised tasks: next-token prediction (NTP) and scheduled masked-token prediction (SMTP). The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as graph-, edge-, and node-level prediction. Despite its simplicity, GraphGPT achieves performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods on multiple large-scale Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets. It demonstrates exceptional results on the molecular property prediction dataset PCQM4Mv2 and the protein-protein interaction dataset ogbl-ppa. Notably, generative pre-training enables scaling GraphGPT to 2 billion parameters while maintaining performance gains - a breakthrough that overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and prior graph transformers (GTs). To advance research in graph foundation models and facilitate scientific discovery in chemistry, materials science, and related fields, we will release the source code (https://github.com/alibaba/graph-gpt) and pre-trained checkpoints.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[OpenGT: A Comprehensive Benchmark For Graph Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04765v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel. Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at https://github.com/eaglelab-zju/OpenGT.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Usually, action coordination is represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA) module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these Transformer-based DGNNs vary significantly, highlighting the importance of properly defining the SAM on dynamic graphs and comprehensively encoding temporal and interactive dynamics without extra complex modules. In this work, we propose TIDFormer, a dynamic graph TransFormer that fully exploits Temporal and Interactive Dynamics in an efficient manner. We clarify and verify the interpretability of our proposed SAM, addressing the open problem of its uninterpretable definitions on dynamic graphs in previous works. To model the temporal and interactive dynamics, respectively, we utilize the calendar-based time partitioning information and extract informative interaction embeddings for both bipartite and non-bipartite graphs using merely the sampled first-order neighbors. In addition, we jointly model temporal and interactive features by capturing potential changes in historical interaction patterns through a simple decomposition. We conduct extensive experiments on several dynamic graph datasets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of TIDFormer. The experimental results demonstrate that TIDFormer excels, outperforming state-of-the-art models across most datasets and experimental settings. Furthermore, TIDFormer exhibits significant efficiency advantages compared to previous Transformer-based methods.</p></details> | KDD2025 |
| **[Simple Path Structural Encoding for Graph Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09365v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph transformers extend global self-attention to graph-structured data, achieving notable success in graph learning. Recently, random walk structural encoding (RWSE) has been found to further enhance their predictive power by encoding both structural and positional information into the edge representation. However, RWSE cannot always distinguish between edges that belong to different local graph patterns, which reduces its ability to capture the full structural complexity of graphs. This work introduces Simple Path Structural Encoding (SPSE), a novel method that utilizes simple path counts for edge encoding. We show theoretically and experimentally that SPSE overcomes the limitations of RWSE, providing a richer representation of graph structures, particularly for capturing local cyclic patterns. To make SPSE computationally tractable, we propose an efficient approximate algorithm for simple path counting. SPSE demonstrates significant performance improvements over RWSE on various benchmarks, including molecular and long-range graph datasets, achieving statistically significant gains in discriminative tasks. These results pose SPSE as a powerful edge encoding alternative for enhancing the expressivity of graph transformers.</p></details> |  |

Simple Architectures Meet Excellence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09263v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often criticized for their limited expressiveness, issues like over-smoothing and over-squashing, and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies. Conversely, Graph Transformers (GTs) are regarded as superior due to their employment of global attention mechanisms, which potentially mitigate these challenges. Literature frequently suggests that GTs outperform GNNs in graph-level tasks, especially for graph classification and regression on small molecular graphs. In this study, we explore the untapped potential of GNNs through an enhanced framework, GNN+, which integrates six widely used techniques: edge feature integration, normalization, dropout, residual connections, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding, to effectively tackle graph-level tasks. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of three classic GNNs (GCN, GIN, and GatedGCN) enhanced by the GNN+ framework across 14 well-known graph-level datasets. Our results reveal that, contrary to prevailing beliefs, these classic GNNs consistently match or surpass the performance of GTs, securing top-three rankings across all datasets and achieving first place in eight. Furthermore, they demonstrate greater efficiency, running several times faster than GTs on many datasets. This highlights the potential of simple GNN architectures, challenging the notion that complex mechanisms in GTs are essential for superior graph-level performance.

However, integrating the vital structural information of KGs into Large Language Models (LLMs) and outputting predictions deterministically remains challenging. To address this, we propose a new method called GLTW, which encodes the structural information of KGs and merges it with LLMs to enhance KGC performance. Specifically, we introduce an improved Graph Transformer (iGT) that effectively encodes subgraphs with both local and global structural information and inherits the characteristics of language model, bypassing training from scratch. Also, we develop a subgraph-based multi-classification training objective, using all entities within KG as classification objects, to boost learning efficiency.Importantly, we combine iGT with an LLM that takes KG language prompts as input.Our extensive experiments on various KG datasets show that GLTW achieves significant performance gains compared to SOTA baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025(Findings)</p></details> |

However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/FelixMessi/QDLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, Work in Progress</p></details> |

Aligning these models to low-resource languages is essential yet challenging due to limited high-quality data. While English alignment datasets are readily available, curating equivalent data in other languages is expensive and time-consuming. A common workaround is to translate existing English alignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve critical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured formats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective translation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable parts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence structure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this approach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the importance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated samples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on the low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by Google Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B. The results highlight the promise of selective translation as a practical and effective method for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Art of Scaling Reinforcement Learning Compute for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13786v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets, there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum, and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long achieved in pre-training.</p></details> | 28 pages, 20 figures |

In contrast, human cognition fluidly adapts between intuitive, heuristic (System 1) and analytical, deliberative (System 2) reasoning depending on the context. This difference between human cognitive flexibility and LLMs' reliance on a single reasoning style raises a critical question: while human fast heuristic reasoning evolved for its efficiency and adaptability, is a uniform reasoning approach truly optimal for LLMs, or does its inflexibility make them brittle and unreliable when faced with tasks demanding more agile, intuitive responses? To answer these questions, we explicitly align LLMs to these reasoning styles by curating a dataset with valid System 1 and System 2 answers, and evaluate their performance across reasoning benchmarks. Our results reveal an accuracy-efficiency trade-off: System 2-aligned models excel in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, while System 1-aligned models perform better in commonsense reasoning tasks. To analyze the reasoning spectrum, we interpolated between the two extremes by varying the proportion of alignment data, which resulted in a monotonic change in accuracy. A mechanistic analysis of model responses shows that System 1 models employ more definitive outputs, whereas System 2 models demonstrate greater uncertainty. Building on these findings, we further combine System 1- and System 2-aligned models based on the entropy of their generations, without additional training, and obtain a dynamic model that outperforms across nearly all benchmarks. This work challenges the assumption that step-by-step reasoning is always optimal and highlights the need for adapting reasoning strategies based on task demands.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce a suite of five Hindi LLM evaluation datasets: IFEval-Hi, MT-Bench-Hi, GSM8K-Hi, ChatRAG-Hi, and BFCL-Hi. These were created using a methodology that combines from-scratch human annotation with a translate-and-verify process. We leverage this suite to conduct an extensive benchmarking of open-source LLMs supporting Hindi, providing a detailed comparative analysis of their current capabilities. Our curation process also serves as a replicable methodology for developing benchmarks in other low-resource languages.</p></details> |  |

Confidence estimation is especially critical in high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an incorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach extends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward network (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information loss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax normalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification task, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness against noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry customer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms strong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints. Experiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the 16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency. Our results demonstrate that activation-based confidence modeling offers a scalable, architecture-aware path toward trustworthy RAG deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Uncer...</summary><p>UncertaiNLP at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, current LLM-based approaches face critical limitations in modeling users' long-term and diverse interests. First, due to inference latency and feature fetching bandwidth constraints, existing methods typically truncate user behavior sequences to include only the most recent interactions, resulting in the loss of valuable long-range preference signals. Second, most current methods rely on next-item prediction with a single predicted embedding, overlooking the multifaceted nature of user interests and limiting recommendation diversity. To address these challenges, we propose HyMiRec, a hybrid multi-interest sequential recommendation framework, which leverages a lightweight recommender to extracts coarse interest embeddings from long user sequences and an LLM-based recommender to captures refined interest embeddings. To alleviate the overhead of fetching features, we introduce a residual codebook based on cosine similarity, enabling efficient compression and reuse of user history embeddings. To model the diverse preferences of users, we design a disentangled multi-interest learning module, which leverages multiple interest queries to learn disentangles multiple interest signals adaptively, allowing the model to capture different facets of user intent. Extensive experiments are conducted on both benchmark datasets and a collected industrial dataset, demonstrating our effectiveness over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, online A/B testing shows that HyMiRec brings consistent improvements in real-world recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Don't Be Greedy, Just Relax! Pruning LLMs via Frank-Wolfe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13713v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements of Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the per-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full retraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However, finding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it to optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics that ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective. In this work, we instead consider the convex relaxation of these combinatorial constraints and solve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Our method drastically reduces the per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient. We provide theoretical justification by showing that, combined with the convergence guarantees of the FW algorithm, we obtain an approximate solution to the original combinatorial problem upon rounding the relaxed solution to integrality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative LLM-Based Generation and Refinement of Distracting Conditions in Math Word Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08615v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for the intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs) are a popular type of math problems. Most MWP datasets consist of problems containing only the necessary information, while problems with distracting and excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior works have tested popular LLMs and found a dramatic performance drop in the presence of distracting conditions. However, datasets of MWPs with distracting conditions are limited, and most suffer from lower levels of difficulty and out-of-context expressions. This makes distracting conditions easy to identify and exclude, thus reducing the credibility of benchmarking on them. Moreover, when adding distracting conditions, the reasoning and answers may also change, requiring intensive labor to check and write the solutions. To address these issues, we design an iterative framework to generate distracting conditions using LLMs. We develop a set of prompts to revise MWPs from different perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the generation of distracting conditions as well as suggestions for further revision. Another advantage is the shared solutions between original and revised problems: we explicitly guide the LLMs to generate distracting conditions that do not alter the original solutions, thus avoiding the need to generate new solutions. This framework is efficient and easy to deploy, reducing the overhead of generating MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining data quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning for Data Collection Scheduling in UAV-assisted Sensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14556v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being utilized in various private and commercial applications, e.g., traffic control, parcel delivery, and Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. Machine Learning (ML) methods used in UAV-Assisted Sensor Networks (UASNETs) and, especially, in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) face challenges such as complex and lengthy model training, gaps between simulation and reality, and low sampling efficiency, which conflict with the urgency of emergencies, such as SAR missions. In this paper, an In-Context Learning (ICL)-Data Collection Scheduling (ICLDC) system is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The UAV collects sensory data and transmits it to a Large Language Model (LLM), which creates a task description in natural language. From this description, the UAV receives a data collection schedule that must be executed. A verifier ensures safe UAV operations by evaluating the schedules generated by the LLM and overriding unsafe schedules based on predefined rules. The system continuously adapts by incorporating feedback into the task descriptions and using this for future decisions. This method is tested against jailbreaking attacks, where the task description is manipulated to undermine network performance, highlighting the vulnerability of LLMs to such attacks. The proposed ICLDC significantly reduces cumulative packet loss compared to both the DQN and Maximum Channel Gain baselines. ICLDC presents a promising direction for intelligent scheduling and control in UASNETs.</p></details> |  |

In real-world scenarios, variations in output length cause severe workload imbalance in the decode phase, particularly for long-output reasoning tasks. Existing systems, such as PD disaggregation architectures, rely on static prefill-to-decode scheduling, which often results in SLO violations and OOM failures under evolving decode workloads. In this paper, we propose ARES, an adaptive decoding rescheduling system powered by length prediction to anticipate future workloads. Our core contributions include: (1) A lightweight and continuous LLM-native prediction method that leverages LLM hidden state to model remaining generation length with high precision (reducing MAE by 49.42%) and low overhead (cutting predictor parameters by 93.28%); (2) A rescheduling solution in decode phase with : A dynamic balancing mechanism that integrates current and predicted workloads, reducing P99 TPOT by 74.77% and achieving up to 2.24 times higher goodput.</p></details> |  |

However, multi-agent collaboration faces critical safety challenges, such as hallucination amplification and error injection and propagation. This paper presents GUARDIAN, a unified method for detecting and mitigating multiple safety concerns in GUARDing Intelligent Agent collaboratioNs. By modeling the multi-agent collaboration process as a discrete-time temporal attributed graph, GUARDIAN explicitly captures the propagation dynamics of hallucinations and errors. The unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture incorporating an incremental training paradigm learns to reconstruct node attributes and graph structures from latent embeddings, enabling the identification of anomalous nodes and edges with unparalleled precision. Moreover, we introduce a graph abstraction mechanism based on the Information Bottleneck Theory, which compresses temporal interaction graphs while preserving essential patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate GUARDIAN's effectiveness in safeguarding LLM multi-agent collaborations against diverse safety vulnerabilities, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with efficient resource utilization.

| **[Closing the Gap Between Text and Speech Understanding in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13632v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to extend their text capabilities to speech inputs. However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform their text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language understanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap: the performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs relative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text. Recent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech synthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic data, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not reproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient alternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we analyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities during adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text. Based on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with Learning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines cross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment while mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves competitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain benchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training on over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates whether instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial (three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000 question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families (7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to 41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3 topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models. Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning. The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from https://huggingface.co/datasets/stefan-m-lenz/ICDOPS-QA-2024.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

These conflicts are especially problematic in real-world investment services, where a model's inherent biases can misalign with institutional objectives, leading to unreliable recommendations. Despite this risk, the intrinsic investment biases of LLMs remain underexplored. We propose an experimental framework to investigate emergent behaviors in such conflict scenarios, offering a quantitative analysis of bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract the latent biases of models and measure their persistence. Our analysis, centered on sector, size, and momentum, reveals distinct, model-specific biases. Across most models, a tendency to prefer technology stocks, large-cap stocks, and contrarian strategies is observed. These foundational biases often escalate into confirmation bias, causing models to cling to initial judgments even when faced with increasing counter-evidence. A public leaderboard benchmarking bias across a broader set of models is available at https://linqalpha.com/leaderboard</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF)</p></details> |

In this paper, we (Tu_Character_lab) report our participation in the Commonsense Persona-Grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025 Round 2, which eval- uates agents across three tracks: task-oriented dialogue, context-aware dialogue, and their integration. Our approach combines two complementary strategies: (i) lightweight prompting techniques in the API track, including a Deflanderization prompting method to suppress excessive role-play and improve task fidelity, and (ii) fine-tuned large models in the GPU track, leveraging Qwen3-14B with supervisedfinetuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA).

Automated repair of such failures is promising, but existing techniques rely on test cases, which are not available for non-compilable code. We employ an automated repair approach for compilation errors driven by large language models (LLMs). Our study encompasses the collection of more than 40000 commits from the product's source code. We assess the performance of an industrial CI system enhanced by four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing their outcomes with manual corrections provided by human programmers. LLM-equipped CI systems can resolve up to 63 % of the compilation errors in our baseline dataset. Among the fixes associated with successful CI builds, 83 % are deemed reasonable. Moreover, LLMs significantly reduce debugging time, with the majority of successful cases completed within 8 minutes, compared to hours typically required for manual debugging.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, conference: 2025 28th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)</p></details> |

Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has emphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the question of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance performance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem and study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark designed to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning ability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into TextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment, develop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a surrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we find that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative rankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of leaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware reporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that even subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Illuminates LLM Reasoning: The Preplan-and-Anchor Rhythm Enables Fine-Grained Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13554v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics: 1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, they are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions hidden in a webpage deceive the agent into unwanted actions. These attacks can bypass traditional web security boundaries, as the AI agent operates with the user privileges across sites. In this paper, we present a novel fuzzing framework that runs entirely in the browser and is guided by an LLM to automatically discover such prompt injection vulnerabilities in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages , 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs' Swarm intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04364v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict swarm-like constraints-limited local perception and communication-remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\times k$ view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of leading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent performance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our results indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust long-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty inherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like constraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized intelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built on a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive datasets. This aims to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of emergent collective behavior under severe informational decentralization. Our code repository is available at https://github.com/x66ccff/swarmbench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidence as a Reward: Transforming LLMs into Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13501v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500 and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms existing self-training methods.</p></details> |  |

Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full retraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is thus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more viable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1) representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To address these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, \hk{an enhanced benchmark with broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both single and batch edits under strict locality constraints}. We then propose MedREK, a retrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key module for precise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for informative guidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks demonstrate that our MedREK achieves superior performance across different core metrics and provides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/mylittleriver/MedREK.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Do LLM Agents Have Regret? A Case Study in Online Learning and Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16843v5)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for (interactive) decision-making, via the development of LLM-based autonomous agents. Despite their emerging successes, the performance of LLM agents in decision-making has not been fully investigated through quantitative metrics, especially in the multi-agent setting when they interact with each other, a typical scenario in real-world LLM-agent applications. To better understand the limits of LLM agents in these interactive environments, we propose to study their interactions in benchmark decision-making settings in online learning and game theory, through the performance metric of \emph{regret}. We first empirically study the {no-regret} behaviors of LLMs in canonical (non-stationary) online learning problems, as well as the emergence of equilibria when LLM agents interact through playing repeated games. We then provide some theoretical insights into the no-regret behaviors of LLM agents, under certain assumptions on the supervised pre-training and the rationality model of human decision-makers who generate the data. Notably, we also identify (simple) cases where advanced LLMs such as GPT-4 fail to be no-regret. To promote the no-regret behaviors, we propose a novel \emph{unsupervised} training loss of \emph{regret-loss}, which, in contrast to the supervised pre-training loss, does not require the labels of (optimal) actions. We then establish the statistical guarantee of generalization bound for regret-loss minimization, followed by the optimization guarantee that minimizing such a loss may automatically lead to known no-regret learning algorithms. Our further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our regret-loss, especially in addressing the above ``regrettable'' cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready version of ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, developing LLMs for Arabic presents unique challenges. This paper explores these challenges by focusing on critical aspects such as data curation, tokenizer design, and evaluation. We detail our approach to the collection and filtration of Arabic pre-training datasets, assess the impact of various tokenizer designs on model performance, and examine the limitations of existing Arabic evaluation frameworks, for which we propose a systematic corrective methodology. To promote transparency and facilitate collaborative development, we share our data and methodologies, contributing to the advancement of language modeling, particularly for the Arabic language.</p></details> |  |

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard interface for such extensions, but current implementations rely solely on semantic matching between users' requests and server function descriptions, which makes current deployments and simulation testbeds fragile under latency fluctuations or server failures. We address this gap by enhancing MCP tool routing algorithms with real-time awareness of network and server status. To provide a controlled test environment for development and evaluation, we construct a heterogeneous experimental platform, namely Network-aware MCP (NetMCP), which offers five representative network states and build a benchmark for latency sequence generation and MCP server datasets. On top of NetMCP platform, we analyze latency sequences and propose a Semantic-Oriented and Network-Aware Routing (SONAR) algorithm, which jointly optimizes semantic similarity and network Quality of Service (QoS) metrics for adaptive tool routing. Results show that SONAR consistently improves task success rate and reduces completion time and failure number compared with semantic-only, LLM-based baselines, demonstrating the value of network-aware design for production-scale LLM systems. The code for NetMCP is available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/NetMCP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing LLM Reasoning Through Implicit Causal Chain Discovery in Climate Discourse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13417v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce. Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit, mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.</p></details> |  |

With the help of LLM inference frameworks, such as llama.cpp, which support optimizations such as KV-caching and quantization, it is now easier than ever to deploy LLMs on edge devices. Quantization is fundamental to enable LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices, and llama.cpp utilizes block floating point (BFP) quantization to drastically reduce the bit width of weights and input tensors, the memory footprint, and the computational power required to run LLMs. LLMs are typically quantized with mixed BFP quantization across the model layers to reduce the loss of model accuracy due to quantization. Therefore, to efficiently accelerate across the layers of BFP-quantized LLMs, specialized accelerators need to support different BFP variants without reconfiguration. To address this issue, we propose a Flexible Block FloatingPoint Quantization (F-BFQ) accelerator, which can dynamically switch between two BFP quantization variants and perform matrix multiplication (MatMul) operations. Our initial F-BFQ accelerator design, deployed on the AMD Kria board, reduces inference time by 1.4x on average over the Arm NEON-based CPU execution across three BFP quantized LLMs while achieving 5.2 tokens per second (~3.9 words per second).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Workshop on New Approaches for Addressing the Computing Requirements of LLMs and GNNs (LG-ARC) @ ISCA 2025</p></details> |

Language Models (LLMs) presents new avenues for automating these security practices by emulating human behavior. However, a comprehensive understanding of LLMs' efficacy and limitations in performing autonomous Linux privilege-escalation attacks remains under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce hackingBuddyGPT, a fully automated LLM-driven prototype designed for autonomous Linux privilege-escalation. We curated a novel, publicly available Linux privilege-escalation benchmark, enabling controlled and reproducible evaluation. Our empirical analysis assesses the quantitative success rates and qualitative operational behaviors of various LLMs -- GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4-Turbo, and Llama3 -- against baselines of human professional pen-testers and traditional automated tools. We investigate the impact of context management strategies, different context sizes, and various high-level guidance mechanisms on LLM performance. Results show that GPT-4-Turbo demonstrates high efficacy, successfully exploiting 33-83% of vulnerabilities, a performance comparable to human pen-testers (75%). In contrast, local models like Llama3 exhibited limited success (0-33%), and GPT-3.5-Turbo achieved moderate rates (16-50%). We show that both high-level guidance and state-management through LLM-driven reflection significantly boost LLM success rates. Qualitative analysis reveals both LLMs' strengths and weaknesses in generating valid commands and highlights challenges in common-sense reasoning, error handling, and multi-step exploitation, particularly with temporal dependencies. Cost analysis indicates that GPT-4-Turbo can achieve human-comparable performance at competitive costs, especially with optimized context management.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes the Multi-Aspect Driven LLM Agent MADRec, an autonomous LLM-based recommender that constructs user and item profiles by unsupervised extraction of multi-aspect information from reviews and performs direct recommendation, sequential recommendation, and explanation generation. MADRec generates structured profiles via aspect-category-based summarization and applies Re-Ranking to construct high-density inputs. When the ground-truth item is missing from the output, the Self-Feedback mechanism dynamically adjusts the inference criteria. Experiments across multiple domains show that MADRec outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines in both precision and explainability, with human evaluation further confirming the persuasiveness of the generated explanations.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Prevailing mitigation strategies, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic working memories, improve information recall but still engage with fundamentally static knowledge sources and follow pre-defined single reasoning path. This hinders their ability to preserve factual and logical consistency of their responses in multi-turn dialogues while the context evolves over time. To address this issue, we propose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn dialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic, structured representation of the conversational context. This is achieved via two synergistic components: (1) a Dynamic Structured Memory (DSM), which incrementally constructs and maintains an authoritative, OWL-compliant knowledge graph of the conversation; and (2) a Reasoning Tree (RT), which executes inferences as an explicit and traceable multi-step search over the graph. As the popular-used quality score (judged by GPT-4) can overlook logical flaws, we introduce new NLI-based metrics to better measure multi-turn dialogue consistency. Comprehensive experiments on the MT-Bench-101 benchmark show that D-SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, elevating the dialogue consistency score by over 48\% for both proprietary and open-source models, and notably improves the quality score of the latter by up to 10.1\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures (main content); 25 pages, 18 figures (total)</p></details> |

These biases are identified by examining the output of SA models for sentences that only vary in the identity groups of the subjects. Constructing natural, linguistically rich, relevant, and diverse sets of sentences that provide sufficient coverage over the domain is expensive, especially when addressing a wide range of biases: it requires domain experts and/or crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we present a novel bias testing framework, BTC-SAM, which generates high-quality test cases for bias testing in SA models with minimal specification using Large Language Models (LLMs) for the controllable generation of test sentences. Our experiments show that relying on LLMs can provide high linguistic variation and diversity in the test sentences, thereby offering better test coverage compared to base prompting methods even for previously unseen biases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> |

However, its application faces significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights for healthcare applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Figur...</summary><p>Figure 1 updated, typos corrected, references added, under review</p></details> |

Existing solutions often struggle with real-time oversight, multi-modal data handling, and explainability -- limitations that hinder their adoption in regulated environments. Existing guardrails largely operate in isolation, focused on text alone making them inadequate for multi-modal, production-scale environments. We introduce Protect, natively multi-modal guardrailing model designed to operate seamlessly across text, image, and audio inputs, designed for enterprise-grade deployment. Protect integrates fine-tuned, category-specific adapters trained via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on an extensive, multi-modal dataset covering four safety dimensions: toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection. Our teacher-assisted annotation pipeline leverages reasoning and explanation traces to generate high-fidelity, context-aware labels across modalities. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all safety dimensions, surpassing existing open and proprietary models such as WildGuard, LlamaGuard-4, and GPT-4.1. Protect establishes a strong foundation for trustworthy, auditable, and production-ready safety systems capable of operating across text, image, and audio modalities.</p></details> |  |

Supervised and contrastive approaches rely on data with spurious correlations and often confuse style with topic. Despite their natural use in AI-generated text detection, the CLM pre-training of modern LLMs has been scarcely leveraged for general authorship problems. We propose a novel unsupervised approach based on this extensive pre-training and the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, employing the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability from one text to another. Our method significantly outperforms LLM prompting approaches of comparable scale and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively trained baselines when controlling for topical correlations. Moreover, performance scales fairly consistently with the size of the base model and, in the case of authorship verification, with an additional mechanism that increases test-time computation; enabling flexible trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization: mini-critics boost LLM reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01656v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic: conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO, achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Generative artificial intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent interaction systems to deliver efficient, personalized, and 24/7 support. In practice, intelligent interaction systems encounter several challenges: (1) Constructing high-quality data for cold-start training is difficult, hindering self-evolution and raising labor costs. (2) Multi-turn dialogue performance remains suboptimal due to inadequate intent understanding, rule compliance, and solution extraction. (3) Frequent evolution of business rules affects system operability and transferability, constraining low-cost expansion and adaptability. (4) Reliance on a single LLM is insufficient in complex scenarios, where the absence of multi-agent frameworks and effective collaboration undermines process completeness and service quality. (5) The open-domain nature of multi-turn dialogues, lacking unified golden answers, hampers quantitative evaluation and continuous optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce WOWService, an intelligent interaction system tailored for industrial applications. With the integration of LLMs and multi-agent architectures, WOWService enables autonomous task management and collaborative problem-solving. Specifically, WOWService focuses on core modules including data construction, general capability enhancement, business scenario adaptation, multi-agent coordination, and automated evaluation. Currently, WOWService is deployed on the Meituan App, achieving significant gains in key metrics, e.g., User Satisfaction Metric 1 (USM 1) -27.53% and User Satisfaction Metric 2 (USM 2) +25.51%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing user needs and advancing personalized service.</p></details> | 36 pages, 14 figures |

Benchmarking LLMs on the Board Game Concept](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13271v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved striking successes on many benchmarks, yet recent studies continue to expose fundamental weaknesses. In particular, tasks that require abstract reasoning remain challenging, often because they use representations such as grids, symbols, or visual patterns that differ from the natural language data LLMs are trained on. In this paper, we introduce Concept, a simple word-guessing board game, as a benchmark for probing abductive reasoning in a representation that is much closer to LLM pre-training data: natural language. Our results show that this game, easily solved by humans (with a success rate of over 90\%), is still very challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs (no model exceeds 40\% success rate). Specifically, we observe that LLMs struggle with interpreting other players' strategic intents, and with correcting initial hypotheses given sequential information updates. In addition, we extend the evaluation across multiple languages, and find that the LLM performance drops further in lower-resource languages (Dutch, French, and Spanish) compared to English.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRIDAI: Generating and Repairing Intrusion Detection Rules via Collaboration among Multiple LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13257v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rule-based network intrusion detection systems play a crucial role in the real-time detection of Web attacks. However, most existing works primarily focus on automatically generating detection rules for new attacks, often overlooking the relationships between new attacks and existing rules, which leads to significant redundancy within the ever-expanding ruleset. To address this issue, we propose GRIDAI, a novel end-to-end framework for the automated Generation and Repair of Intrusion Detection rules through collaboration among multiple LLM-based agents. Unlike traditional methods, GRIDAI first assesses the nature of incoming attack samples. If the sample represents a new attack type, it is used to generate a new rule. Otherwise, the sample is identified as a variant of an attack already covered by an existing rule and used to repair the rule by updating the corresponding signature, thereby enhancing its generalization capability. Additionally, to mitigate syntactic and semantic errors in rules caused by LLM hallucinations, we incorporate a tool-based real-time validation mechanism and a representative attack sample maintained for each rule, enabling fully automated rule generation and repair. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on a public dataset containing seven types of attacks and a private dataset with 43 attack types. The results demonstrate that GRIDAI accurately identifies the relationships between new attack samples and existing rules, efficiently generates and repairs rules to handle new attacks and variants, and effectively mitigates the impact of LLM hallucinations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Unlearning Meets Adversarial Robustness via Constrained Interventions on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03567v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), more customization is needed to ensure privacy-preserving and safe generation. We address this objective from two critical aspects: unlearning of sensitive information and robustness to jail-breaking attacks. We investigate various constrained optimization formulations that address both aspects in a \emph{unified manner}, by finding the smallest possible interventions on LLM weights that either make a given vocabulary set unreachable or embed the LLM with robustness to tailored attacks by shifting part of the weights to a \emph{safer} region. Beyond unifying two key properties, this approach contrasts with previous work in that it doesn't require an oracle classifier that is typically not available or represents a computational overhead. Surprisingly, we find that the simplest point-wise constraint-based intervention we propose leads to better performance than max-min interventions, while having a lower computational cost. Comparison against state-of-the-art defense methods demonstrates superior performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Network Protocol Testing with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13248v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network protocol testing is fundamental for modern network infrastructure. However, traditional network protocol testing methods are labor-intensive and error-prone, requiring manual interpretation of specifications, test case design, and translation into executable artifacts, typically demanding one person-day of effort per test case. Existing model-based approaches provide partial automation but still involve substantial manual modeling and expert intervention, leading to high costs and limited adaptability to diverse and evolving protocols. In this paper, we propose a first-of-its-kind system called NeTestLLM that takes advantage of multi-agent Large Language Models (LLMs) for end-to-end automated network protocol testing. NeTestLLM employs hierarchical protocol understanding to capture complex specifications, iterative test case generation to improve coverage, a task-specific workflow for executable artifact generation, and runtime feedback analysis for debugging and refinement. NeTestLLM has been deployed in a production environment for several months, receiving positive feedback from domain experts. In experiments, NeTestLLM generated 4,632 test cases for OSPF, RIP, and BGP, covering 41 historical FRRouting bugs compared to 11 by current national standards. The process of generating executable artifacts also improves testing efficiency by a factor of 8.65x compared to manual methods. NeTestLLM provides the first practical LLM-powered solution for automated end-to-end testing of heterogeneous network protocols.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Surface: Enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge Alignment with Human via Internal Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03550v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of automated evaluation using LLMs, a paradigm known as "LLM-as-a-judge". However, improving its alignment with human preferences without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. Previous studies mainly optimize based on shallow outputs, overlooking rich cross-layer representations. In this work, motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode semantically and task-relevant representations that are often more aligned with human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a post-hoc, plug-and-play framework for improving the alignment of LLM-as-a-Judge point-wise evaluations with human scores by leveraging internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by aggregating cross-layer score-token logits and computing the expected score from a softmax-based distribution, while keeping the LLM backbone frozen and ensuring no impact on the inference process. LAGER fully leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications, such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the generalization of LAGER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Static LLM Policies: Imitation-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13229v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RecSys) have become critical tools for enhancing user engagement by delivering personalized content across diverse digital platforms. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential for improving RecSys, primarily due to their exceptional generalization capabilities and sophisticated contextual understanding, which facilitate the generation of flexible and interpretable recommendations. However, the direct deployment of LLMs as primary recommendation policies presents notable challenges, including persistent latency issues stemming from frequent API calls and inherent model limitations such as hallucinations and biases. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework that leverages imitation learning from LLM-generated trajectories. Specifically, inverse reinforcement learning is employed to extract robust reward models from LLM demonstrations. This approach negates the need for LLM fine-tuning, thereby substantially reducing computational overhead. Simultaneously, the RL policy is guided by the cumulative rewards derived from these demonstrations, effectively transferring the semantic insights captured by the LLM. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating superior performance when compared against state-of-the-art RL-based and in-context learning baselines.

Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution. Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available: https://github.com/LongfeiYun17/falconer</p></details> |
| **[BanaServe: Unified KV Cache and Dynamic Module Migration for Balancing Disaggregated LLM Serving in AI Infrastructure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13223v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in AI infrastructure, driving the need for high throughput, resource efficient serving systems. Disaggregated LLM serving, which separates prompt prefill from auto-regressive decode, has emerged as a promising architecture by isolating their heterogeneous compute and memory demands. However, current disaggregated systems face three key limitations: (i) static resource allocation cannot adapt to highly dynamic workloads, causing over-provisioning that wastes resources or under-provisioning that violates service level objectives (SLOs); (ii) inherent load imbalance between prefill and decode stages, where prefill is compute-bound and decode is memory-bound, causes under-utilization in one tier while the other becomes a bottleneck; and (iii) prefix cache aware routing skews load distribution, as high cache hit rate prefill nodes attract disproportionately more requests, further degrading balance and efficiency. To address these issues, we present BanaServe, a dynamic orchestration framework that continuously rebalances computational and memory resources across prefill and decode instances while eliminating hotspots induced by cache. BanaServe introduces layer level weight migration, attention level Key Value Cache (KV Cache) migration, and Global KV Cache Store sharing with layer wise overlapped transmission, enabling both coarse grained (layer level) and fine grained (attention level) load redistribution with minimal latency overhead. These mechanisms allow routers to perform purely load aware scheduling, unconstrained by cache placement. Compared to vLLM, BanaServe achieves 1.2x-3.9x higher throughput with 3.9%-78.4% lower total processing time, and outperforms DistServe by 1.1x-2.8x in throughput with 1.4%-70.1% latency reduction.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[LLM-guided Hierarchical Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13217v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern IR systems are increasingly tasked with answering complex, multi-faceted queries that require deep reasoning rather than simple keyword or semantic matching. While LLM-based IR has shown great promise, the prevailing retrieve-then-rerank paradigm inherits the limitations of embedding-based retrieval; parametric generative approaches are difficult to update with new information; and long-context methods that place the entire corpus in context are computationally infeasible for large document collections. To address these challenges, we introduce LATTICE, a hierarchical retrieval framework that enables an LLM to reason over and navigate large corpora with logarithmic search complexity by imposing a semantic tree structure on the corpus. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) an offline phase that organizes the corpus into a semantic hierarchy via either a bottom-up agglomerative strategy or a top-down divisive strategy using multi-level summaries and (2) an online traversal phase where a search LLM navigates this tree. A central challenge in such LLM-guided search is that the model's relevance judgments are noisy, context-dependent, and unaware of the hierarchy, making cross-branch and cross-level comparisons difficult. To overcome this, we propose a traversal algorithm that estimates calibrated latent relevance scores from local LLM outputs and aggregates them into a global path relevance metric. Our training-free framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, demonstrating up to 9% improvement in Recall@100 and 5% in nDCG@10 over the next best zero-shot baseline. Furthermore, compared to the fine-tuned SOTA method DIVER-v2, LATTICE attains comparable results on BRIGHT subsets that use a static corpus for evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Guided Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA) for Mitigating Bias in AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13202v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bias in AI systems, especially those relying on natural language data, raises ethical and practical concerns. Underrepresentation of certain groups often leads to uneven performance across demographics. Traditional fairness methods, such as pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing, depend on protected-attribute labels, involve accuracy-fairness trade-offs, and may not generalize across datasets. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Guided Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA), which uses large language models to generate counterfactual examples for underrepresented groups while preserving label integrity. We evaluated LGSA on a controlled dataset of short English sentences with gendered pronouns, professions, and binary classification labels. Structured prompts were used to produce gender-swapped paraphrases, followed by quality control including semantic similarity checks, attribute verification, toxicity screening, and human spot checks. The augmented dataset expanded training coverage and was used to train a classifier under consistent conditions. Results show that LGSA reduces performance disparities without compromising accuracy. The baseline model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy with a 7.2 percent gender bias gap. Simple swap augmentation reduced the gap to 0.7 percent but lowered accuracy to 95.6 percent. LGSA achieved 99.1 percent accuracy with a 1.9 percent bias gap, improving performance on female-labeled examples. These findings demonstrate that LGSA is an effective strategy for bias mitigation, enhancing subgroup balance while maintaining high task accuracy and label fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 1 Table, submitted to an international conference</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal LLM: Reasoning about Environments and Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05258v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current MLLMs are challenged by "spatio-temporal" prompts, i.e., prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment encoded in a point cloud that the MLLM should consider; and simultaneously also refer to 2) actions that happened in part of the environment and are encoded in a short ego-centric video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this challenge, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent MLLMs indeed struggle to correctly answer "spatio-temporal" prompts. Building on this dataset, we study two spatio-temporal LLM (STLLM) baselines: 1) STLLM-3D, which directly fuses point cloud, video, and text representations as inputs to the LLM; and 2) STLLM-Aligner, which aligns spatial context with video and text before LLM decoding. Both baselines aim to enhance spatial understanding of environments and temporal grounding of egocentric observations. On REA, the STLLM baselines outperform existing models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.

However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution, desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, existing methods often struggle to achieve effective synergy between system effectiveness and cost efficiency, leading to neither unsatisfying performance nor excessive LLM prompt tokens and inference time. To this end, this paper proposes REMINDRAG, which employs an LLM-guided graph traversal featuring node exploration, node exploitation, and, most notably, memory replay, to improve both system effectiveness and cost efficiency. Specifically, REMINDRAG memorizes traversal experience within KG edge embeddings, mirroring the way LLMs "memorize" world knowledge within their parameters, but in a train-free manner. We theoretically and experimentally confirm the effectiveness of REMINDRAG, demonstrating its superiority over existing baselines across various benchmark datasets and LLM backbones.

With flexible few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent frameworks in biomedical informatics.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ACM-BCB'25: ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics [ACM SIGBio Best Paper Award]</p></details> |

Prior methods (Medusa, Hydra, EAGLE) partially reduce draft cost but either degrade acceptance or introduce overheads that limit scaling. We present Mirror Speculative Decoding (Mirror-SD), an inference algorithm that breaks the latency-acceptance tradeoff. Mirror-SD launches branch-complete rollouts from early-exit signals in parallel with the target model's suffix and explicitly maps computation across heterogeneous accelerators (GPU and NPU) to exploit cross-device parallelism. The draft speculates forward continuations for the target to verify, while the target simultaneously speculates correction paths for the draft, converting speculation into two complementary execution pipelines. To further cut draft latency without weakening acceptance semantics, we add speculative streaming so the draft emits multiple tokens per step. This dual strategy of parallel heterogeneous execution plus multi-token speculative streaming pushes speculative decoding toward its ideal regime of high acceptance with low overhead. On SpecBench with server-scale models from 14B to 66B parameters, Mirror-SD delivers consistent end-to-end gains, achieving 2.8x-5.8x wall-time speedups across diverse tasks and a 30% average relative improvement over the strongest baseline, EAGLE3.</p></details> |  |

MENA Values Benchmark for Evaluating Cultural Alignment and Multilingual Bias in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13154v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MENAValues, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the cultural alignment and multilingual biases of large language models (LLMs) with respect to the beliefs and values of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, an underrepresented area in current AI evaluation efforts. Drawing from large-scale, authoritative human surveys, we curate a structured dataset that captures the sociocultural landscape of MENA with population-level response distributions from 16 countries. To probe LLM behavior, we evaluate diverse models across multiple conditions formed by crossing three perspective framings (neutral, personalized, and third-person/cultural observer) with two language modes (English and localized native languages: Arabic, Persian, Turkish). Our analysis reveals three critical phenomena: "Cross-Lingual Value Shifts" where identical questions yield drastically different responses based on language, "Reasoning-Induced Degradation" where prompting models to explain their reasoning worsens cultural alignment, and "Logit Leakage" where models refuse sensitive questions while internal probabilities reveal strong hidden preferences. We further demonstrate that models collapse into simplistic linguistic categories when operating in native languages, treating diverse nations as monolithic entities. MENAValues offers a scalable framework for diagnosing cultural misalignment, providing both empirical insights and methodological tools for developing more culturally inclusive AI.</p></details> |  |

However, the accuracy and robustness of one-shot LLM predictions remain highly sensitive to the examples and the diversity among ensemble members. This study systematically investigates the effects of example representativeness (one-shot strategy) and output diversity (sampling temperature) on LLM ensemble performance. Two one-shot strategies are compared: centroid-based representative examples (proposed) and randomly sampled examples (baseline) and sampling temperature also is varied. The proposed approach with higher temperature setting significantly outperforms random selection by +7.6% (macro-F1) and -10.5% (RMSE). Furthermore, the proposed model exceeds 5-shot prompting by +21.1% (macro-F1) and -24.0% (RMSE). Our findings demonstrate that combining representative example selection with increased temperature provides the appropriate level of diversity to the ensemble. This work highlights the practical importance of both example selection and controlled diversity in designing effective one-shot LLM ensembles.</p></details> |  |

This misalignment frequently results in implementation delays or failures. Here, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs), noted for their capabilities in reasoning and simulating human decision-making, can help inform and address this alignment problem. We develop a multi-agent simulation in which LLMs, acting as agents representing residents from different communities in a city, participate in a referendum on a set of transit policy proposals. Using chain-of-thought reasoning, LLM agents provide ranked-choice or approval-based preferences, which are aggregated using instant-runoff voting (IRV) to model democratic consensus. We implement this simulation framework with both GPT-4o and Claude-3.5, and apply it for Chicago and Houston. Our findings suggest that LLM agents are capable of approximating plausible collective preferences and responding to local context, while also displaying model-specific behavioral biases and modest divergences from optimization-based benchmarks. These capabilities underscore both the promise and limitations of LLMs as tools for solving the alignment problem in transportation decision-making.</p></details> |  |

Recently, their potential for automating precise text editing tasks across specialized domains, such as programming code, LaTeX, and structured database languages, has gained attention. However, current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle with executing precise, instruction-driven edits, particularly when structural accuracy and strict adherence to domain conventions are required. To address these challenges, we introduce InstrEditBench, an automated benchmark dataset comprising over 30,000 structured editing tasks spanning diverse domains, including Wikipedia articles, LaTeX documents, source code, and database languages. Using this benchmark, we develop FineEdit, a specialized editing model explicitly trained for accurate, context-aware text modifications. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FineEdit outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving improvements of approximately 10\% over Gemini models on single-turn edits, up to 30\% over Llama-3.2-3B, and exceeding Mistral-7B-OpenOrca performance by over 40\% on direct editing tasks. FineEdit also effectively generalizes to realistic multi-turn editing scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability. To facilitate further research and reproducibility, we release FineEdit at https://github.com/StuRinDQB/FineEdit} and https://huggingface.co/datasets/YimingZeng/FineEdit_bench.</p></details> |  |

In comparison with traditional rule or small-model based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design, modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows, and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data (e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling), (iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding, programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g., data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes). Finally, we outline the remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis.</p></details> | 32 page, 11 figures |
| **[Týr-the-Pruner: Structural Pruning LLMs via Global Sparsity Distribution Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09657v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structural pruning enhances hardware-agnostic inference efficiency for large language models (LLMs) yet often fails to maintain comparable performance. Local pruning performs efficient layer-by-layer compression but ignores global topology. Although global pruning aims to identify an optimal sparse model, intuitive methods typically adopt a two-stage paradigm that first evaluates substructure saliency and then applies global pruning, which ignores inter-structure dependencies and fails to achieve end-to-end optimization. To address these limitations, we propose T\'yr-the-Pruner, an efficient end-to-end search-based global structural pruning framework. This framework constructs a supernet by repeatedly applying local pruning across a range of sparsity ratios to each layer in an LLM, with the core goal of determining the optimal sparsity distribution under a target overall sparsity ratio. Concretely, we introduce an effective local pruning and an expectation error accumulation approach to improve supernet construction. Furthermore, we employ an iterative prune-and-search strategy with coarse-to-fine sparsity granularity to ensure efficient search convergence. Experimental results show that T\'yr-the-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art structural pruning, retaining 97% of the dense model's performance while removing a challenging 50% of Llama-3.1-70B's parameters.

| **[EgoSocial: Benchmarking Proactive Intervention Ability of Omnimodal LLMs via Egocentric Social Interaction Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13105v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective. However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini 2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions, precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4 by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance. We will release the dataset and code soon.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between reasoning effectiveness and efficiency, often encouraging unnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we propose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement fine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning with fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as a hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense process reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in parameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We propose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and the Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly reduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately rewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T optimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each episode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning benchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different tasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2025</p></details> |

However, unreliable search results may also pose safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work, we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds, covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover, our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices, such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases are publicly available: https://github.com/jianshuod/SafeSearch.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, existing continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter isolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks degrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and weakening generalization.We propose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial mixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual instruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated LoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter independence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable cross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting self-evolution.Extensive experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for continual instruction tuning. In real-world A/B testing for content compliance review on the Tencent Video platform, MoE-CL reduced manual review costs by 15.3%. These results demonstrate that MoE-CL is practical for large-scale industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are critical.</p></details> |  |

While these platforms can reduce bias from traditional hiring, the personal information in user profiles raises concerns about ongoing discrimination. Past studies on this topic have mostly used existing data, which makes it hard to control for other factors and clearly see the effect of things like gender or race. To solve these problems, this paper presents a new method that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a Large Language Model (LLM) to create realistic, artificial freelancer profiles for controlled experiments. This approach effectively separates individual factors, enabling a clearer statistical analysis of how different variables influence the freelancer project process. In addition to analyzing extracted data with traditional statistical methods for post-project stage analysis, our research utilizes a dataset with highly controlled variables, generated by an RAG-LLM, to conduct a simulated hiring experiment for pre-project stage analysis. The results of our experiments show that, regarding gender, while no significant preference emerged in initial hiring decisions, female freelancers are substantially more likely to receive imperfect ratings post-project stage. Regarding regional bias, a strong and consistent preference favoring US-based freelancers shows that people are more likely to be selected in the simulated experiments, perceived as more leader-like, and receive higher ratings on the live platform.</p></details> |  |

Investigating the Role of Clinical Specialty Data in Medical LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10113v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce S-MedQA, an English medical question-answering (QA) dataset for benchmarking large language models (LLMs) in fine-grained clinical specialties. S-MedQA has over 20k examples, covers 15 medical specialties, and QA pairs can have multiple specialty annotations (e.g., when a question is cross-disciplinary), constructed with both machine and expert verification to maximize data availability. We use S-MedQA to investigate the role of clinical specialty data in the knowledge-intensive scenario of medical QA. Our results show that 1) training on data from a clinical specialty does not necessarily lead to best performance on that specialty, and 2) regardless of the specialty the LLM was fine-tuned on, token probabilities of clinically relevant terms increase consistently across all specialties. Thus, we hypothesize improvement gains are derived mostly from domain shifting (e.g., general to medical) rather than specialty-specific knowledge injection, and suggest rethinking the role of fine-tuning data in the medical domain.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating the Effectiveness of Prompted Knowledge Cutoffs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02340v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability. With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff? In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks.

What drives this consistency in the generation? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability concentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this concentration, we introduce the *Branching Factor* (BF)--a token-invariant measure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our empirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as generation progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they generate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output distribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude (e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps explain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies. Building on this insight, we find this consistency has surprising implications for complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g., DeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating longer reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic (lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that alignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead steers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., ``Sure'') that unlock low-entropy trajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by nudging experiments, which show prompting base models with such tokens can similarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful diagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how alignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how base models can be steered away from diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codeb...</summary><p>Codebase: https://github.com/yangalan123/LLMBranchingFactor.

However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e. finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems, curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills, and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our b...</summary><p>Our benchmark dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/binxingao/extrem-bench</p></details> |

While prior work has demonstrated that LLMs can generate disinformation, specific questions around persuasiveness and personalisation (generation of disinformation tailored to specific demographic attributes) remain largely unstudied. This paper presents the first large-scale, multilingual empirical study on persona-targeted disinformation generation by LLMs. Employing a red teaming methodology, we systematically evaluate the robustness of LLM safety mechanisms to persona-targeted prompts. A key novel result is AI-TRAITS (AI-generaTed peRsonAlIsed disinformaTion dataSet), a new dataset of around 1.6 million texts generated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs. AI-TRAITS is seeded by prompts that combine 324 disinformation narratives and 150 distinct persona profiles, covering four major languages (English, Russian, Portuguese, Hindi) and key demographic dimensions (country, generation, political orientation). The resulting personalised narratives are then assessed quantitatively and compared along the dimensions of models, languages, jailbreaking rate, and personalisation attributes. Our findings demonstrate that the use of even simple personalisation strategies in the prompts significantly increases the likelihood of jailbreaks for all studied LLMs. Furthermore, personalised prompts result in altered linguistic and rhetorical patterns and amplify the persuasiveness of the LLM-generated false narratives. These insights expose critical vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art LLMs and offer a foundation for improving safety alignment and detection strategies in multilingual and cross-demographic contexts.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous methods and offering insights into their failure modes.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAL: Probing Audio Encoders via LLMs - Audio Information Transfer into LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10423v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integration of audio perception into large language models (LLMs) is an emerging research area for enabling machine listening applications, yet efficient transfer of rich audio semantics from audio encoders to LLMs remains underexplored. The most widely used integration paradigm projects the audio encoder output tokens into the LLM input space (e.g., via an MLP or a Q-Former), then prepends or inserts them to the text tokens. We refer to this generic scheme as Prepend to the LLM's input token space (PLITS) integration. We propose an efficient alternative, Lightweight Audio LLM Integration (LAL). LAL introduces audio representations solely via the attention mechanism within different layers of the LLM, bypassing its feedforward module. LAL encodes rich audio semantics at an appropriate level of abstraction for integration into different blocks of LLMs. Our design significantly reduces computational overhead compared to existing integration approaches. Observing with Whisper that the speech encoder benefits from PLITS integration, we propose an audio encoder aware approach for efficiently Probing Audio encoders via LLM (PAL), which employs PLITS integration for Whisper and LAL for general audio encoders. Under an identical training curriculum, LAL consistently maintains performance or outperforms existing integration approaches across multiple base LLMs and tasks. For general audio tasks, LAL improvement is up to 30% over a strong PLITS baseline while reducing memory usage by up to 64.1% and increasing throughput by up to 247.5%. Furthermore, for general audio-music-speech LLM, PAL performs on par with a fully PLITS integration-based system but with substantially improved computational and memory efficiency.

In this work, we investigate cultural variation in curiosity using Yahoo! Answers, a real-world multi-country dataset spanning diverse topics. We introduce CUEST (CUriosity Evaluation across SocieTies), an evaluation framework that measures human-model alignment in curiosity through linguistic (style), topic preference (content) analysis and grounding insights in social science constructs. Across open- and closed-source models, we find that LLMs flatten cross-cultural diversity, aligning more closely with how curiosity is expressed in Western countries. We then explore fine-tuning strategies to induce curiosity in LLMs, narrowing the human-model alignment gap by up to 50\%. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of curiosity for LLM adaptability across cultures, showing its importance for future NLP research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint (Paper under review)</p></details> |

In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to inquiry personas, i.e. user profiles that convey attributes like identity, expertise, or belief. While prior work has primarily focused on adversarial inputs or distractors for robustness testing, we evaluate plausible, human-centered inquiry persona cues that users disclose in real-world interactions. We find that such cues can meaningfully alter QA accuracy and trigger failure modes such as refusals, hallucinated limitations, and role confusion. These effects highlight how model sensitivity to user framing can compromise factual reliability, and position inquiry persona testing as an effective tool for robustness evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs could evade monitoring through steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations. In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography: passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given additional affordances like using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes, including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities. While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed monitors at present, this could change in the future.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces NL2Flow, a fully automated pipeline for generating and evaluating workflow planning problems. NL2Flow generates problems parametrically in a structured intermediate representation, translating them into both natural language and formal PDDL. I evaluate several open-source, instruct-tuned LLMs on a dataset of 2296 low-difficulty problems generated by NL2Flow. Results demonstrate that the best-performing model achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal plans (for solvable problems). Regression analysis shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is contingent on both model and prompt design. Importantly, translating natural language problems into a structured JSON representation prior to symbolic planning significantly improved success rates, suggesting a benefit from neuro-symbolic integration. These findings underscore the importance of understanding error sources within LLM reasoning as systems scale to more complex tasks. As LLM reasoning scales to increasingly complex problems, understanding the shifting bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will be crucial.</p></details> | 30 pages, 7 figures |

Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with DRG coding due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) nature of the task: pretraining corpora rarely contain private clinical or billing data. We introduce DRG-Sapphire, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for automated DRG coding from clinical notes. Built on Qwen2.5-7B and trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using rule-based rewards, DRG-Sapphire introduces a series of RL enhancements to address domain-specific challenges not seen in previous mathematical tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MIMIC-IV benchmark and generates physician-validated reasoning for DRG assignments, significantly enhancing explainability. Our study further sheds light on broader challenges of applying RL to knowledge-intensive, OOD tasks. We observe that RL performance scales approximately linearly with the logarithm of the number of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) examples, suggesting that RL effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the domain knowledge encoded in the base model. For OOD tasks like DRG coding, strong RL performance requires sufficient knowledge infusion prior to RL. Consequently, scaling SFT may be more effective and computationally efficient than scaling RL alone for such tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from repeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical pipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full context-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to inefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution for avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes remain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to diverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify that the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents. To address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables efficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning cache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM estimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of cached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under varying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing dynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM achieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including retrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks, all without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent receives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a five-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard prefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in NeurIPS2025.

Existing approaches, such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1, the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools. Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.</p></details> |  |

Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining, and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip, execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision: using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing, and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to +3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA, AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware, accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, Under submission</p></details> |

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) overcomes this historical barrier, allowing applications developers to instantly govern model behavior by editing prompt instructions. This shift enables a new paradigm: data-model co-evolution, where a living test set and a model's instructions evolve in tandem. We operationalize this paradigm in an interactive system designed to address the critical challenge of encoding subtle, domain-specific policies into prompt instructions. The system's structured workflow guides people to discover edge cases, articulate rationales for desired behavior, and iteratively evaluate instruction revisions against a growing test set. A user study shows our workflow helps participants refine instructions systematically and specify ambiguous policies more concretely.

In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B, LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices. This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP Findings 2025</p></details> |

However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals, providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations. We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Debate for LLM Judges with Adaptive Stability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12697v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Delegates to Trustees: How Optimizing for Long-Term Interests Shapes Bias and Alignment in LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12689v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising accuracy in predicting survey responses and policy preferences, which has increased interest in their potential to represent human interests in various domains. Most existing research has focused on behavioral cloning, effectively evaluating how well models reproduce individuals' expressed preferences. Drawing on theories of political representation, we highlight an underexplored design trade-off: whether AI systems should act as delegates, mirroring expressed preferences, or as trustees, exercising judgment about what best serves an individual's interests. This trade-off is closely related to issues of LLM sycophancy, where models can encourage behavior or validate beliefs that may be aligned with a user's short-term preferences, but is detrimental to their long-term interests. Through a series of experiments simulating votes on various policy issues in the U.S. context, we apply a temporal utility framework that weighs short and long-term interests (simulating a trustee role) and compare voting outcomes to behavior-cloning models (simulating a delegate). We find that trustee-style predictions weighted toward long-term interests produce policy decisions that align more closely with expert consensus on well-understood issues, but also show greater bias toward models' default stances on topics lacking clear agreement. These findings reveal a fundamental trade-off in designing AI systems to represent human interests. Delegate models better preserve user autonomy but may diverge from well-supported policy positions, while trustee models can promote welfare on well-understood issues yet risk paternalism and bias on subjective topics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Hybrid Thinking: Can LLMs Truly Switch Between Think and No-Think?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12680v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2) using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that, compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500) and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from $5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

However, in domains aiming for carbon neutrality and high-performance renewable energy systems, current AI-assisted design automation methods face critical challenges in explainability, scalability, and practical usability. To address these limitations, we introduce PHIA (Physics-Informed Autonomous Agent), an LLM-driven system that automates modulation design for power converters in Power Electronics Systems with minimal human intervention. In contrast to traditional pipeline-based methods, PHIA incorporates an LLM-based planning module that interactively acquires and verifies design requirements via a user-friendly chat interface. This planner collaborates with physics-informed simulation and optimization components to autonomously generate and iteratively refine modulation designs. The interactive interface also supports interpretability by providing textual explanations and visual outputs throughout the design process. Experimental results show that PHIA reduces standard mean absolute error by 63.2% compared to the second-best benchmark and accelerates the overall design process by over 33 times. A user study involving 20 domain experts further confirms PHIA's superior design efficiency and usability, highlighting its potential to transform industrial design workflows in power electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 Innovative Applications of AI</p></details> |
| **[ChunkKV: Semantic-Preserving KV Cache Compression for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00299v5)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant GPU memory when processing long texts, with the key value (KV) cache consuming up to 70\% of total memory during inference. Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem.

| **[KnowledgeSmith: Uncovering Knowledge Updating in LLMs with Model Editing and Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02392v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing and machine unlearning are two popular approaches for large language models (LLMs) to stay up-to-date. However, the knowledge updating mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation, plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[StyleDecipher: Robust and Explainable Detection of LLM-Generated Texts with Stylistic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12608v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings, StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts, demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for distinguishing machine-generated text.

However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent, which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research: https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/PrefCleanBench.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, applying IBN effectively to the RAN scheduler [...] remains a significant challenge. Current approaches predominantly rely on coarse-grained network slicing, lacking the granularity for dynamic adaptation to individual user conditions and traffic patterns. Despite the existence of a vast body of scheduling algorithms [...], their practical utilization is hindered by implementation heterogeneity, insufficient systematic evaluation in production environments, and the complexity of developing high-performance scheduler implementations.[...] To address these limitations, we propose ALLSTaR (Automated LLm-driven Scheduler generation and Testing for intent-based RAN), a novel framework leveraging LLMs for automated, intent-driven scheduler design, implementation, and evaluation. ALLSTaR interprets NL intents, automatically generates functional scheduler code from the research literature using OCR and LLMs, and intelligently matches operator intents to the most suitable scheduler(s). Our implementation deploys these schedulers as O-RAN dApps, enabling on-the-fly deployment and testing on a production-grade, 5G-compliant testbed. This approach has enabled the largest-scale OTA experimental comparison of 18 scheduling algorithms automatically synthesized from the academic literature. The resulting performance profiles serve as the input for our Intent-Based Scheduling (IBS) framework, which dynamically selects and deploys appropriate schedulers that optimally satisfy operator intents. We validate our approach through multiple use cases unattainable with current slicing-based optimization techniques, demonstrating fine-grained control based on buffer status, physical layer conditions, and heterogeneous traffic types</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission to an IEEE journal, copyright may change without notice</p></details> |
| **[MooseAgent: A LLM Based Multi-agent Framework for Automating Moose Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08621v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used in engineering and scientific computing, but its pre-processing, solver configuration, and post-processing stages are often time-consuming and require specialized knowledge. This paper proposes an automated solution framework, MooseAgent, for the multi-physics simulation framework MOOSE, which combines large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs) with a multi-agent system. The framework uses LLMs to understand user-described simulation requirements in natural language and employs task decomposition and multi-round iterative verification strategies to automatically generate MOOSE input files. To improve accuracy and reduce model hallucinations, the system builds and utilizes a vector database containing annotated MOOSE input cards and function documentation. We conducted experimental evaluations on several typical cases, including heat transfer, mechanics, phase field, and multi-physics coupling. The results show that MooseAgent can automate the MOOSE simulation process to a certain extent, especially demonstrating a high success rate when dealing with relatively simple single-physics problems. The main contribution of this research is the proposal of a multi-agent automated framework for MOOSE, which validates its potential in simplifying finite element simulation processes and lowering the user barrier, providing new ideas for the development of intelligent finite element simulation software. The code for the MooseAgent framework proposed in this paper has been open-sourced and is available at https://github.com/taozhan18/MooseAgent</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 Figs |

Large language models (LLMs) introduce new dimensions to these challenges through their ability to generate persuasive content at scale and reinforcing existing biases. This study investigates the bidirectional persuasion dynamics between LLMs and humans when exposed to misinformative content. We analyze human-to-LLM influence using human-stance datasets and assess LLM-to-human influence by generating LLM-based persuasive arguments. Additionally, we use a multi-agent LLM framework to analyze the spread of misinformation under persuasion among demographic-oriented LLM agents. Our findings show that demographic factors influence susceptibility to misinformation in LLMs, closely reflecting the demographic-based patterns seen in human susceptibility. We also find that, similar to human demographic groups, multi-agent LLMs exhibit echo chamber behavior. This research explores the interplay between humans and LLMs, highlighting demographic differences in the context of misinformation and offering insights for future interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Generation of Bias-Eliciting Questions for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12857v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now widely deployed in user-facing applications, reaching hundreds of millions worldwide. As they become integrated into everyday tasks, growing reliance on their outputs raises significant concerns. In particular, users may unknowingly be exposed to model-inherent biases that systematically disadvantage or stereotype certain groups. However, existing bias benchmarks continue to rely on templated prompts or restrictive multiple-choice questions that are suggestive, simplistic, and fail to capture the complexity of real-world user interactions. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a counterfactual bias evaluation framework that automatically generates realistic, open-ended questions over sensitive attributes such as sex, race, or religion. By iteratively mutating and selecting bias-inducing questions, our approach systematically explores areas where models are most susceptible to biased behavior. Beyond detecting harmful biases, we also capture distinct response dimensions that are increasingly relevant in user interactions, such as asymmetric refusals and explicit acknowledgment of bias. Leveraging our framework, we construct CAB, a human-verified benchmark spanning diverse topics, designed to enable cross-model comparisons. Using CAB, we analyze a range of LLMs across multiple bias dimensions, revealing nuanced insights into how different models manifest bias. For instance, while GPT-5 outperforms other models, it nonetheless exhibits persistent biases in specific scenarios. These findings underscore the need for continual improvements to ensure fair model behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating and Mitigating LLM-as-a-judge Bias in Communication Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12462v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e., GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11 types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores. Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, synchronizing gradients in data parallel setups introduces communication overhead that grows with the number of workers, limiting parallelization efficiency. Local optimization algorithms reduce communications but incur high memory costs as they prevent optimizer state sharding, hindering scalability. To address this, we propose \textbf{AC}cumulate while \textbf{CO}mmunicate (ACCO), a memory-efficient optimization algorithm for distributed LLM training. By synchronizing delayed gradients while computing new ones, ACCO reduces GPU idle time and supports heterogeneous hardware. To mitigate the convergence issues caused by delayed updates, we introduce a novel technique ensuring training dynamics align with standard distributed optimization. Compared to ZeRO-1, our approach is significantly faster and scales effectively across heterogeneous hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTOS: A LLM-Driven Multi-topic Opinion Simulation Framework for Exploring Echo Chamber Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12423v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models, meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation (MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory, incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS, varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts, and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and system stability.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11figures |

Travel agencies are eager to offload this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation.

Among these reasoning tasks, graph problems stand out due to their complexity and unique structural characteristics, attracting considerable attention from researchers. Previous studies have explored LLMs' graph reasoning abilities through various techniques, such as different encoding methods for graph structures and the use of carefully designed prompts. However, a critical factor has been mostly overlooked: the prompt sequential order in which graph descriptions are presented to the models. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of how the order of graph descriptions impacts LLM performance. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate four graph description orders across six graph problems using six mainstream LLMs. The results reveal that: (1) ordered graph descriptions significantly improve LLMs' comprehension of graph structures; (2) the robustness of LLMs to graph description order varies across different tasks; and (3) the impact of graph order on performance is closely related to the inherent characteristics of tasks. This study provides a critical advancement in the application of LLMs for solving graph-related problems, paving the way for future research to optimize model performance through strategic graph description ordering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |

This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols, followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities: Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency, while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.</p></details> | 6 pages 4 figures |

While methods such as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy, GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3% reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of current state-of-the-art ViGs.

| **[Axial Neural Networks for Dimension-Free Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13665v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems. Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining for foundation models.</p></details> |  |

We adopt a task-oriented perspective to systematically review the applications and advancements of multimodal fusion methods and VLMs in the field of robot vision. For semantic scene understanding tasks, we categorize fusion approaches into encoder-decoder frameworks, attention-based architectures, and graph neural networks. Meanwhile, we also analyze the architectural characteristics and practical implementations of these fusion strategies in key tasks such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), 3D object detection, navigation, and manipulation. We compare the evolutionary paths and applicability of VLMs based on large language models (LLMs) with traditional multimodal fusion methods.Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of commonly used datasets, evaluating their applicability and challenges in real-world robotic scenarios. Building on this analysis, we identify key challenges in current research, including cross-modal alignment, efficient fusion, real-time deployment, and domain adaptation.

| **[Intelligent4DSE: Optimizing High-Level Synthesis Design Space Exploration with Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19649v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-Level Synthesis (HLS) Design Space Exploration (DSE) is essential for generating hardware designs that balance performance, power, and area (PPA). To optimize this process, existing works often employs message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to predict quality of results (QoR). These predictors serve as evaluators in the DSE process, effectively bypassing the time-consuming estimations traditionally required by HLS tools. However, existing models based on MPNNs struggle with over-smoothing and limited expressiveness. Additionally, while meta-heuristic algorithms are widely used in DSE, they typically require extensive domain-specific knowledge to design operators and time-consuming tuning. To address these limitations, we propose ECoGNNs-LLMMHs, a framework that integrates graph neural networks with task-adaptive message passing and large language model-enhanced meta-heuristic algorithms. Compared with state-of-the-art works, ECoGNN exhibits lower prediction error in the post-HLS prediction task, with the error reduced by 57.27\%. For post-implementation prediction tasks, ECoGNN demonstrates the lowest prediction errors, with average reductions of 17.6\% for flip-flop (FF) usage, 33.7\% for critical path (CP) delay, 26.3\% for power consumption, 38.3\% for digital signal processor (DSP) utilization, and 40.8\% for BRAM usage. LLMMH variants can generate superior Pareto fronts compared to meta-heuristic algorithms in terms of average distance from the reference set (ADRS) with average improvements of 87.47\%, respectively. Compared with the SOTA DSE approaches GNN-DSE and IRONMAN-PRO, LLMMH can reduce the ADRS by 68.17\% and 63.07\% respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, exact computation is intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count (5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 11-page appendix</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Teleconnections with Physics-Informed Graph Attention Networks for Long-Range Extreme Rainfall Forecasting in Thailand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12328v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Graph Domain Adaptation: A Spectral Contrastive Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13254v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover, the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Are High-Degree Representations Really Unnecessary in Equivariant Graph Neural Networks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11443v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that incorporate E(3) symmetry have achieved significant success in various scientific applications. As one of the most successful models, EGNN leverages a simple scalarization technique to perform equivariant message passing over only Cartesian vectors (i.e., 1st-degree steerable vectors), enjoying greater efficiency and efficacy compared to equivariant GNNs using higher-degree steerable vectors. This success suggests that higher-degree representations might be unnecessary. In this paper, we disprove this hypothesis by exploring the expressivity of equivariant GNNs on symmetric structures, including $k$-fold rotations and regular polyhedra. We theoretically demonstrate that equivariant GNNs will always degenerate to a zero function if the degree of the output representations is fixed to 1 or other specific values. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose HEGNN, a high-degree version of EGNN to increase the expressivity by incorporating high-degree steerable vectors while maintaining EGNN's efficiency through the scalarization trick. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HEGNN not only aligns with our theoretical analyses on toy datasets consisting of symmetric structures, but also shows substantial improvements on more complicated datasets such as $N$-body and MD17. Our theoretical findings and empirical results potentially open up new possibilities for the research of equivariant GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universally Invariant Learning in Equivariant GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13169v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and 2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining strong practical efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-hoc Popularity Bias Correction in GNN-based Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12959v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User historical interaction data is the primary signal for learning user preferences in collaborative filtering (CF). However, the training data often exhibits a long-tailed distribution, where only a few items have the majority of interactions. CF models trained directly on such imbalanced data are prone to learning popularity bias, which reduces personalization and leads to suboptimal recommendation quality. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), while effective for CF due to their message passing mechanism, can further propagate and amplify popularity bias through their aggregation process. Existing approaches typically address popularity bias by modifying training objectives but fail to directly counteract the bias propagated during GNN's neighborhood aggregation. Applying weights to interactions during aggregation can help alleviate this problem, yet it risks distorting model learning due to unstable node representations in the early stages of training. In this paper, we propose a Post-hoc Popularity Debiasing (PPD) method that corrects for popularity bias in GNN-based CF and operates directly on pre-trained embeddings without requiring retraining. By estimating interaction-level popularity and removing popularity components from node representations via a popularity direction vector, PPD reduces bias while preserving user preferences. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for popularity bias correction in GNN-based CF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rademacher Meets Colors: More Expressivity, but at What Cost ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10101v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity -- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power often comes at the cost of generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Neurodegeneration with Brain Age Gap Prediction Models: A Graph Signal Processing Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12763v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neurodegeneration, characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal structure or function, is commonly assessed in clinical practice through reductions in cortical thickness or brain volume, as visualized by structural MRI. While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical sophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy aging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age gap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain age gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's predicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The resulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with recent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and severity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their methodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical populations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces a principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in graph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the anatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong theoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust estimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP, machine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path forward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research directions in personalized medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Signal Processing Magazine</p></details> |
| **[Multi-View Graph Learning with Graph-Tuple](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10341v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges, making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs, such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and versatility of our multi-view approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to TAG workshop</p></details> |

The general chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT) significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes. Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference in industrial drug discovery workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Exact Subgraph Matching via GNN-based Path Dominance Embedding (Technical Report)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15641v5)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classic problem of exact subgraph matching returns those subgraphs in a large-scale data graph that are isomorphic to a given query graph, which has gained increasing importance in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective graph neural network (GNN)-based path embedding framework (GNN-PE), which allows efficient exact subgraph matching without introducing false dismissals. Unlike traditional GNN-based graph embeddings that only produce approximate subgraph matching results, in this paper, we carefully devise GNN-based embeddings for paths, such that: if two paths (and 1-hop neighbors of vertices on them) have the subgraph relationship, their corresponding GNN-based embedding vectors will strictly follow the dominance relationship. With such a newly designed property of path dominance embeddings, we are able to propose effective pruning strategies based on path label/dominance embeddings and guarantee no false dismissals for subgraph matching. We build multidimensional indexes over path embedding vectors, and develop an efficient subgraph matching algorithm by traversing indexes over graph partitions in parallel and applying our pruning methods. We also propose a cost-model-based query plan that obtains query paths from the query graph with low query cost. To further optimize our GNN-PE approach, we also propose a more efficient GNN-based path group embedding (GNN-PGE) technique, which performs subgraph matching over grouped path embedding vectors. We design effective pruning strategies (w.r.t. grouped path embeddings) that can significantly reduce the search space during the index traversal. Through extensive experiments, we confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed GNN-PE and GNN-PGE approaches for exact subgraph matching on both real and synthetic graph data.</p></details> |  |

Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network, Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC) 2026 - Las Vegas, NV, USA 9 - 12 January 2026</p></details> |

Promotion abuse is one of the fastest-growing types of fraud in recent years and is characterized by users exploiting promotional activities to gain financial benefits from the platform. To investigate this issue, we conduct the first study on promotion abuse fraud in e-commerce platforms MEITUAN. We find that promotion abuse fraud is a group-based fraudulent activity with two types of fraudulent activities: Stocking Up and Cashback Abuse. Unlike traditional fraudulent activities such as fake reviews, promotion abuse fraud typically involves ordinary customers conducting legitimate transactions and these two types of fraudulent activities are often intertwined. To address this issue, we propose leveraging additional information from the spatial and temporal perspectives to detect promotion abuse fraud. In this paper, we introduce PROMOGUARDIAN, a novel multi-relation fused graph neural network that integrates the spatial and temporal information of transaction data into a homogeneous graph to detect promotion abuse fraud. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world data from MEITUAN, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in promotion abuse fraud detection, achieving 93.15% precision, detecting 2.1 to 5.0 times more fraudsters, and preventing 1.5 to 8.8 times more financial losses in production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version of this paper is going to appear in IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2026</p></details> |

We extend the notion of systemic risk measures from Biagini, Fouque, Fritelli and Meyer-Brandis (2019) to graph structured data. In particular, we focus on an aggregation function that is derived from a market clearing algorithm proposed by Eisenberg and Noe (2001). In this setting, we show the existence of an optimal random allocation that distributes the overall minimal bailout capital and secures the network. We study numerical methods for the approximation of systemic risk and optimal random allocations. We propose to use permutation equivariant architectures of neural networks like graph neural networks (GNNs) and a class that we name (extended) permutation equivariant neural networks ((X)PENNs). We compare their performance to several benchmark allocations. The main feature of GNNs and (X)PENNs is that they are permutation equivariant with respect to the underlying graph data. In numerical experiments we find evidence that these permutation equivariant methods are superior to other approaches.</p></details> | 50 pages |
| **[Maximum entropy temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02098v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal networks consist of timestamped directed interactions that may appear continuously in time, yet few studies have directly tackled the continuous-time modeling of networks. Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on constraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and interpretable representation: a set of global time processes and a static maximum-entropy edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization yields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree, clustering and motif expectations, and yields a whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy derivation of an inhomogeneous Poisson edge intensity for temporal networks via functional optimization over path entropy, connecting NHPP modeling to maximum-entropy network ensembles. NHPP consistently improve log-likelihood over generic Poisson processes, while the maximum-entropy edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected unique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this framework and how it can be integrated with multivariate Hawkes calibration procedures, renewal theory, and neural kernel estimation in graph neural networks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Enhanced Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks for Million-Scale Heterogeneous Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12401v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Scaling Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning through GNN-Derived Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12840v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.</p></details> |  |

We propose an end-to-end graph neural network (GNN) based neural operator to learn PDE solution operators from data on point clouds in arbitrary domains. Our multi-scale model maps data between input/output point clouds by passing it through a downsampled regional mesh. The approach includes novel elements aimed at ensuring spatio-temporal resolution invariance. Our model, termed RIGNO, is tested on a challenging suite of benchmarks composed of various time-dependent and steady PDEs defined on a diverse set of domains. We demonstrate that RIGNO is significantly more accurate than neural operator baselines and robustly generalizes to unseen resolutions both in space and in time.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism, implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves original feature information through residual connections, which is critical for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint was submitted to IEEE TrustCom 2025.

By integrating large language models (LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs, offering valuable insights for improving their resilience.

Despite extensive training and fine-tuning efforts aimed at enhancing safety, LLMs remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Recently, the emergence of multi-turn attacks has intensified this vulnerability. Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks incrementally escalate dialogue complexity, rendering them more challenging to detect and mitigate. In this study, we introduce G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based input classifier specifically designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks targeting LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, which captures the interrelationships between queries and harmful keywords that present in multi-turn queries. Furthermore, we propose an attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most relevant single-turn query based on the ongoing multi-turn conversation. The retrieved query is incorporated as a labeled node within the graph, thereby enhancing the GNN's capacity to classify the current query as harmful or benign. Evaluation results show that G-Guard consistently outperforms all baselines across diverse datasets and evaluation metrics, demonstrating its efficacy as a robust defense mechanism against multi-turn jailbreak attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Fair Graph Neural Networks Via Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00382v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in graph representation learning across various real-world applications. However, they often produce biased predictions caused by sensitive attributes, such as religion or gender, an issue that has been largely overlooked in existing methods. Recently, numerous studies have focused on reducing biases in GNNs. However, these approaches often rely on training with partial data (e.g., using either node features or graph structure alone), which can enhance fairness but frequently compromises model utility due to the limited utilization of available graph information. To address this tradeoff, we propose an effective strategy to balance fairness and utility in knowledge distillation. Specifically, we introduce FairDTD, a novel Fair representation learning framework built on Dual-Teacher Distillation, leveraging a causal graph model to guide and optimize the design of the distillation process. Specifically, FairDTD employs two fairness-oriented teacher models: a feature teacher and a structure teacher, to facilitate dual distillation, with the student model learning fairness knowledge from the teachers while also leveraging full data to mitigate utility loss. To enhance information transfer, we incorporate graph-level distillation to provide an indirect supplement of graph information during training, as well as a node-specific temperature module to improve the comprehensive transfer of fair knowledge. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairDTD achieves optimal fairness while preserving high model utility, showcasing its effectiveness in fair representation learning for GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Estimation on Graphs with Structure Informed Stochastic Partial Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06907v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks have achieved impressive results across diverse network modeling tasks, but accurately estimating uncertainty on graphs remains difficult, especially under distributional shifts. Unlike traditional uncertainty estimation, graph-based uncertainty must account for randomness arising from both the graph's structure and its label distribution, which adds complexity. In this paper, making an analogy between the evolution of a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by Matern Gaussian Process and message passing using GNN layers, we present a principled way to design a novel message passing scheme that incorporates spatial-temporal noises motivated by the Gaussian Process approach to SPDE. Our method simultaneously captures uncertainty across space and time and allows explicit control over the covariance kernel smoothness, thereby enhancing uncertainty estimates on graphs with both low and high label informativeness. Our extensive experiments on Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection on graph datasets with varying label informativeness demonstrate the soundness and superiority of our model to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Euclidean and Hyperbolic Representations for Node-level Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11827v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the original features and structural features derived from random walks and degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.</p></details> |  |

We describe an algorithm for the satisfiability problem of that logic. It is inspired from the tableau method of vanilla modal logic, extended with reasoning in quantifier-free fragment Boolean algebra with Presburger arithmetic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query-Specific GNN: A Comprehensive Graph Representation Learning Method for Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11541v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources. However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network (QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at: https://github.com/Jerry2398/QSGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Interpretable and Effective Graph Neural Additive Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01317v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant approach for learning over graph-structured data. However, most GNNs operate as black-box models and require post-hoc explanations, which may not suffice in high-stakes scenarios where transparency is crucial. In this paper, we present a GNN that is interpretable by design. Our model, Graph Neural Additive Network (GNAN), is a novel extension of the interpretable class of Generalized Additive Models, and can be visualized and fully understood by humans. GNAN is designed to be fully interpretable, offering both global and local explanations at the feature and graph levels through direct visualization of the model. These visualizations describe exactly how the model uses the relationships between the target variable, the features, and the graph. We demonstrate the intelligibility of GNANs in a series of examples on different tasks and datasets. In addition, we show that the accuracy of GNAN is on par with black-box GNNs, making it suitable for critical applications where transparency is essential, alongside high accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-View Graph Feature Propagation for Privacy Preservation and Feature Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11347v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks. Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each propagating information independently through the graph topology. The aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Event-Aware Prompt Learning for Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11339v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks. Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.</p></details> | Under review |

We address this by proposing, to our knowledge, the first-ever SDEN (Software Defined Energy Network) for CaaS (Computations-as-a-Service) that unifies edge, fog, and cloud compute with 5G URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications), SDN (Software Defined Networking), and NFV (Network Functions Virtualization) to co-optimize energy, latency, and reliability end-to-end. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a joint task offloading formulation that couples computation placement with network capacity under explicit URLLC constraints; (ii) a feasibility preserving, lightweight greedy heuristic that scales while closely tracking optimal energy and latency trade-offs; and (iii) a tiered AI (Artificial Intelligence) pipeline-reactive at the edge, predictive in the fog, strategic in the cloud-featuring privacy-preserving, federated GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) for fault detection and microgrid coordination. Unlike prior edge-only or cloud-only schemes, SDEN turns fragmented grid compute into a single, programmable substrate that delivers dependable, energy-aware, real time analytics establishing a first-ever, software defined path to practical, grid-scale CaaS.</p></details> |  |

This task is particularly challenging in Graph Neural Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06743v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning. Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral-domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: New Perspectives in Advancing Graph Machine Learning</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Network-Based Multicast Routing for On-Demand Streaming Services in 6G Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11109v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increase of bandwidth-intensive applications in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, such as real-time volumetric streaming and multi-sensory extended reality, demands intelligent multicast routing solutions capable of delivering differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) at scale. Traditional shortest-path and multicast routing algorithms are either computationally prohibitive or structurally rigid, and they often fail to support heterogeneous user demands, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. Neural network-based approaches, while offering improved inference speed, typically lack topological generalization and scalability. To address these limitations, this paper presents a graph neural network (GNN)-based multicast routing framework that jointly minimizes total transmission cost and supports user-specific video quality requirements. The routing problem is formulated as a constrained minimum-flow optimization task, and a reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to sequentially construct efficient multicast trees by reusing paths and adapting to network dynamics. A graph attention network (GAT) is employed as the encoder to extract context-aware node embeddings, while a long short-term memory (LSTM) module models the sequential dependencies in routing decisions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method closely approximates optimal dynamic programming-based solutions while significantly reducing computational complexity. The results also confirm strong generalization to large-scale and dynamic network topologies, highlighting the method's potential for real-time deployment in 6G multimedia delivery scenarios.

| **[Revisiting Node Affinity Prediction in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06940v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS - Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising, training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is available at https://github.com/orfeld415/NAVIS</p></details> | preprint |

A significant challenge in this domain is the generalizability of preference models, particularly their efficacy in predicting preferences within environmental configurations not encountered during training. While deep learning models have shown promise in learning complex spatial and contextual dependencies, it remains unclear which neural network architectures are most effective at generalizing to unseen layouts. To address this, we conduct a comparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and standard feedforward Neural Networks using synthetic data generated from a simplified and synthetic pocket park environment. Beginning with this illustrative case study, allows for controlled analysis of each model's ability to transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios. The models are evaluated based on their capacity to predict preferences influenced by heterogeneous physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability score is calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve for the seen and unseen layouts. This generalizability score is appropriate for imbalanced data, providing insights into the suitability of each neural network architecture for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 15th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (IWSHM)</p></details> |

Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.</p></details> |  |

A novel approach that combines game-theoretic control theory with Graph Neural Networks is introduced in this work. By conceptualizing pursuer configurations as strategic arrangements and representing them as graphs, a Graph Characteristic Space is constructed via multi-objective optimization to identify Pareto-optimal configurations. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained on these Pareto-optimal graphs to generate strategically effective initial configurations, termed "hot starts". Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the GCN-generated hot starts provide a significant advantage over random configurations. In scenarios considering multiple pursuers and evaders, this method hastens the decline in evader survival rates, reduces pursuer travel distances, and enhances containment, showcasing clear strategic benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at AAMAS Workshop on Autonomous Robots and Multirobot Systems (ARMS)</p></details> |

Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing. Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.</p></details> |  |

With their growing adoption in engineering design evaluation, a wide range of neural operator architectures have been proposed for various problem settings. However, model selection remains challenging due to the absence of fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address this, we propose and standardize six representative 3D industry-scale engineering design datasets spanning thermal analysis, linear elasticity, elasto-plasticity, time-dependent plastic problems, and computational fluid dynamics. All datasets include fully preprocessed inputs and outputs for model training, making them directly usable across diverse neural operator architectures. Using these datasets, we conduct a systematic comparison of four types of neural operator variants, including Branch-Trunk-based Neural Operators inspired by DeepONet, Graph-based Neural Operators inspired by Graph Neural Networks, Grid-based Neural Operators inspired by Fourier Neural Operators, and Point-based Neural Operators inspired by PointNet. We further introduce practical enhancements to adapt these models to different engineering settings, improving the fairness of the comparison. Our benchmarking study evaluates each model strengths and limitations in terms of predictive performance, computational efficiency, memory usage, and deployment complexity. The findings provide actionable insights to guide future neural operator development.</p></details> |  |

Structure-based pre-training methods are under-explored yet crucial for downstream applications which rely on underlying graph structure. In addition, pre-training traditional message passing GNNs to capture global and regional structure is often challenging due to the risk of oversmoothing as network depth increases. We address these gaps by proposing the Laplacian Eigenvector Learning Module (LELM), a novel pre-training module for graph neural networks (GNNs) based on predicting the low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Moreover, LELM introduces a novel architecture that overcomes oversmoothing, allowing the GNN model to learn long-range interdependencies. Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform baseline models on downstream molecular property prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic features. Experiments on the large-scale MIMIC-IV cohort dataset show that S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba, Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability analyses highlight the complementary contributions of each component of our architecture and underscore the importance of principled graph construction. These results demonstrate that S$^2$G-Net provides an effective and scalable solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data.

Moreover, the complex and diverse local topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge. Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD) framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The model is built on graph neural networks and incorporates a multi-hop neighbor aggregation strategy. By integrating the structural information of knowledge graphs and dynamically assigning importance to different neighbors through an attention mechanism, the model enhances its ability to capture implicit preference relationships. In the proposed method, users and items are embedded into a unified graph structure. Multi-level semantic paths are constructed based on entities and relations in the knowledge graph to extract richer contextual information. During the rating prediction phase, recommendations are generated through the interaction between user and target item representations. The model is optimized using a binary cross-entropy loss function. Experiments conducted on the Amazon Books dataset validate the superior performance of the proposed model across various evaluation metrics. The model also shows good convergence and stability. These results further demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of structure-aware attention mechanisms in knowledge graph-enhanced recommendation.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose \textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters, identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.</p></details> |  |

However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Joint Embeddings of Function and Process Call Graphs for Malware Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09984v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation. While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318 malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face two fundamental challenges: the limited reasoning capacity of single-agent systems and the complexity of designing effective multi-agent architectures, as well as contextual overload that hinders accurate decision-making. We introduce Nutritional-Graph Router (NG-Router), a novel framework that formulates nutritional QA as a supervised, knowledge-graph-guided multi-agent collaboration problem. NG-Router integrates agent nodes into heterogeneous knowledge graphs and employs a graph neural network to learn task-aware routing distributions over agents, leveraging soft supervision derived from empirical agent performance. To further address contextual overload, we propose a gradient-based subgraph retrieval mechanism that identifies salient evidence during training, thereby enhancing multi-hop and relational reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate that NG-Router consistently outperforms both single-agent and ensemble baselines, offering a principled approach to domain-aware multi-agent reasoning for complex nutritional health tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Surrogates to leverage Mechanistic Expert Knowledge towards Reliable and Immediate Pandemic Response](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06500v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During the COVID-19 crisis, mechanistic models have guided evidence-based decision making. However, time-critical decisions in a dynamical environment limit the time available to gather supporting evidence. We address this bottleneck by developing a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate of a spatially and demographically resolved mechanistic metapopulation simulator. This combined approach advances classical machine learning approaches which are often black box. Our design of experiments spans outbreak and persistent-threat regimes, up to three contact change points, and age-structured contact matrices on a 400-node spatial graph. We benchmark multiple GNN layers and identify an ARMAConv-based architecture that offers a strong accuracy-runtime trade-off. Across 30-90 day horizons and up to three contact change points, the surrogate attains 10-27 % mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) while delivering (near) constant runtime with respect to the forecast horizon. Our approach accelerates evaluation by up to 28,670 times compared with the mechanistic model, allowing responsive decision support in time-critical scenarios and straightforward web integration. These results show how GNN surrogates can translate complex metapopulation models into immediate, reliable tools for pandemic response.</p></details> | 29 pages, 7 figures |

However,existing physics-based and data-driven models often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data. We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37 years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States, Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental monitoring and decision-making.</p></details> |  |

We build on previous work that successfully designed site-specific precoders based on a combination of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). In this paper, by utilizing a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we circumvent one of the key drawbacks of GMMs, i.e., the number of GMM components scales exponentially to the feedback bits. In addition, the deep learning architecture of the VQ-VAE allows us to jointly train the GNN together with VQ-VAE along with pilot optimization forming an end-to-end (E2E) model, resulting in considerable performance gains in sum rate for multi-user wireless systems. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed frameworks over the conventional methods involving the sub-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) pilot matrix and iterative precoder algorithms enabling the deployment of systems characterized by fewer pilots or feedback bits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[A Multimodal Approach to SME Credit Scoring Integrating Transaction and Ownership Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09407v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are known to play a vital role in economic growth, employment, and innovation. However, they tend to face significant challenges in accessing credit due to limited financial histories, collateral constraints, and exposure to macroeconomic shocks. These challenges make an accurate credit risk assessment by lenders crucial, particularly since SMEs frequently operate within interconnected firm networks through which default risk can propagate. This paper presents and tests a novel approach for modelling the risk of SME credit, using a unique large data set of SME loans provided by a prominent financial institution. Specifically, our approach employs Graph Neural Networks to predict SME default using multilayer network data derived from common ownership and financial transactions between firms. We show that combining this information with traditional structured data not only improves application scoring performance, but also explicitly models contagion risk between companies. Further analysis shows how the directionality and intensity of these connections influence financial risk contagion, offering a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. Our findings highlight the predictive power of network data, as well as the role of supply chain networks in exposing SMEs to correlated default risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey of Mamba Architectures for Medical Image Analysis: Classification, Segmentation, Restoration and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02362v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a special case of the State Space Model, is gaining popularity as an alternative to template-based deep learning approaches in medical image analysis. While transformers are powerful architectures, they have drawbacks, including quadratic computational complexity and an inability to address long-range dependencies efficiently. This limitation affects the analysis of large and complex datasets in medical imaging, where there are many spatial and temporal relationships. In contrast, Mamba offers benefits that make it well-suited for medical image analysis. It has linear time complexity, which is a significant improvement over transformers. Mamba processes longer sequences without attention mechanisms, enabling faster inference and requiring less memory. Mamba also demonstrates strong performance in merging multimodal data, improving diagnosis accuracy and patient outcomes. The organization of this paper allows readers to appreciate the capabilities of Mamba in medical imaging step by step. We begin by defining core concepts of SSMs and models, including S4, S5, and S6, followed by an exploration of Mamba architectures such as pure Mamba, U-Net variants, and hybrid models with convolutional neural networks, transformers, and Graph Neural Networks. We also cover Mamba optimizations, techniques and adaptations, scanning, datasets, applications, experimental results, and conclude with its challenges and future directions in medical imaging. This review aims to demonstrate the transformative potential of Mamba in overcoming existing barriers within medical imaging while paving the way for innovative advancements in the field. A comprehensive list of Mamba architectures applied in the medical field, reviewed in this work, is available at Github.</p></details> |  |

Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live, interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live, explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events (arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial advantage for a reliable decision support tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGSPATIAL 2025 - GeoAI Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Semantic-Condition Tuning: Fusing Graph Context with Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08966v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn, adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors, enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[When LLM Agents Meet Graph Optimization: An Automated Data Quality Improvement Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08952v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7figures |

We investigate the Set Cover Problem (SCP) and propose Graph-SCP, a graph neural network method that augments existing optimization solvers by learning to identify a smaller sub-problem that contains the solution space. Graph-SCP uses both supervised learning from prior solved instances and unsupervised learning to minimize the SCP objective. We evaluate the performance of Graph-SCP on synthetically weighted and unweighted SCP instances with diverse problem characteristics and complexities, and on instances from the OR Library, a canonical benchmark for SCP. We show that Graph-SCP reduces the problem size by 60-80% and achieves runtime speedups of up to 10x on average when compared to Gurobi (a state-of-the-art commercial solver), while maintaining solution quality. This is in contrast to fast greedy solutions that significantly compromise solution quality to achieve guaranteed polynomial runtime. We showcase Graph-SCP's ability to generalize to larger problem sizes, training on SCP instances with up to 3,000 subsets and testing on SCP instances with up to 10,000 subsets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Graph Condensation via Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02565v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph condensation reduces the size of large graphs while preserving performance, addressing the scalability challenges of Graph Neural Networks caused by computational inefficiencies on large datasets. Existing methods often rely on bi-level optimization, requiring extensive GNN training and limiting their scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph Condensation via Gaussian Process (GCGP), a novel and computationally efficient approach to graph condensation. GCGP utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP), with the condensed graph serving as observations, to estimate the posterior distribution of predictions. This approach eliminates the need for the iterative and resource-intensive training typically required by GNNs. To enhance the capability of the GCGP in capturing dependencies between function values, we derive a specialized covariance function that incorporates structural information. This covariance function broadens the receptive field of input nodes by local neighborhood aggregation, thereby facilitating the representation of intricate dependencies within the nodes. To address the challenge of optimizing binary structural information in condensed graphs, Concrete random variables are utilized to approximate the binary adjacency matrix in a continuous counterpart. This relaxation process allows the adjacency matrix to be represented in a differentiable form, enabling the application of gradient-based optimization techniques to discrete graph structures. Experimental results show that the proposed GCGP method efficiently condenses large-scale graph data while preserving predictive performance, addressing the scalability and efficiency challenges. The implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WANGLin0126/GCGP.</p></details> |  |

However, existing work on fair GNNs often assumes that either sensitive attributes are fully observed or they are missing completely at random. We show that an adversarial missingness process can inadvertently disguise a fair model through the imputation, leading the model to overestimate the fairness of its predictions. We address this challenge by proposing Better Fair than Sorry (BFtS), a fair missing data imputation model for sensitive attributes. The key principle behind BFtS is that imputations should approximate the worst-case scenario for fairness -- i.e. when optimizing fairness is the hardest. We implement this idea using a 3-player adversarial scheme where two adversaries collaborate against a GNN classifier, and the classifier minimizes the maximum bias. Experiments using synthetic and real datasets show that BFtS often achieves a better fairness x accuracy trade-off than existing alternatives under an adversarial missingness process.</p></details> |  |

While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity. Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 22 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

These solutions employ Machine Learning (ML) models for behavioral modeling and critical security tasks such as malware and anomaly detection. However, the opacity of ML-based security models limits their broader adoption, as the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes restricts explainability and verifiability. We tailored our solution towards Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based security solutions since recent studies employ GNNs to comprehensively digest system provenance graphs for security-critical tasks. To enhance the explainability of GNN-based security models, we introduce PROVEXPLAINER, a framework offering instance-level security-aware explanations using an interpretable surrogate model. PROVEXPLAINER's interpretable feature space consists of discriminant subgraph patterns and graph structural features, which can be directly mapped to the system provenance problem space, making the explanations human interpretable. We show how PROVEXPLAINER synergizes with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN explainers to deliver domain and instance-specific explanations. We measure the explanation quality using the Fidelity+/Fidelity- metric as used by traditional GNN explanation literature, we incorporate the precision/recall metric, where we consider the accuracy of the explanation against the ground truth, and we designed a human actionability metric based on graph traversal distance. On real-world Fileless and APT datasets, PROVEXPLAINER achieves up to 29%/27%/25%/1.4x higher Fidelity+, precision, recall, and actionability (where higher values are better), and 12% lower Fidelity- (where lower values are better) when compared against SOTA GNN explainers.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, deep learning models have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework (OneForecast) based on graph neural networks. By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive messaging mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that OneForecast performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.

On the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network, GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human pose.

These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.</p></details> |  |

However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI) between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures. Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442 substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112), and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) Predictive Intelligence in Medicine Workshop (MICCAI PRIME) 2025; 13 pages</p></details> |

This assumption does not hold in many real-world heterophilic graphs. Existing models for heterophilic graphs primarily rely on pairwise relationships, overlooking multi-scale information from higher-order structures. This leads to suboptimal performance, particularly under noise from conflicting class information across nodes. To address these challenges, we propose HPGNN, a novel model integrating Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks. HPGNN introduces an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture long-range and multi-scale node interactions. This approach reduces computational complexity and mitigates noise from surrounding information. By embedding higher-order structural information into convolutional networks, HPGNN effectively models key interactions across diverse graph dimensions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate HPGNN's effectiveness. The model achieves better performance than five out of seven state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining competitive performance on homophilic graphs. HPGNN's ability to balance multi-scale information and robustness to noise makes it a versatile solution for real-world graph learning challenges.

Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD), incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size, mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ARRML2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge-Driven Federated Graph Learning on Model Heterogeneity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12624v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated graph learning (FGL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative graph representation learning, enabling multiple parties to jointly train models while preserving data privacy. However, most existing approaches assume homogeneous client models and largely overlook the challenge of model-centric heterogeneous FGL (MHtFGL), which frequently arises in practice when organizations employ graph neural networks (GNNs) of different scales and architectures.Such architectural diversity not only undermines smooth server-side aggregation, which presupposes a unified representation space shared across clients' updates, but also further complicates the transfer and integration of structural knowledge across clients. To address this issue, we propose the Federated Graph Knowledge Collaboration (FedGKC) framework. FedGKC introduces a lightweight Copilot Model on each client to facilitate knowledge exchange while local architectures are heterogeneous across clients, and employs two complementary mechanisms: Client-side Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation, which transfers effective knowledge between local and copilot models through bidirectional distillation with multi-view perturbation; and Server-side Knowledge-Aware Model Aggregation, which dynamically assigns aggregation weights based on knowledge provided by clients. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedGKC achieves an average accuracy gain of 3.74% over baselines in MHtFGL scenarios, while maintaining excellent performance in homogeneous settings.</p></details> |  |

DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves, it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering, sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified DGTEN framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown strong performance for this problem, but costly graph construction, irregular computations, and random memory access patterns substantially limit their throughput. The recently proposed Hashing-based Efficient Point Transformer (HEPT) offers a theoretically guaranteed near-linear complexity for large point cloud processing via locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) in attention computations; however, its evaluations have largely focused on embedding quality, and the object condensation pipeline on which HEPT relies requires a post-hoc clustering step (e.g., DBScan) that can dominate runtime. In this work, we make two contributions. First, we present a unified, fair evaluation of physics tracking performance for HEPT and a representative GNN-based pipeline under the same dataset and metrics. Second, we introduce HEPTv2 by extending HEPT with a lightweight decoder that eliminates the clustering stage and directly predicts track assignments. This modification preserves HEPT's regular, hardware-friendly computations while enabling ultra-fast end-to-end inference. On the TrackML dataset, optimized HEPTv2 achieves approximately 28 ms per event on an A100 while maintaining competitive tracking efficiency. These results position HEPTv2 as a practical, scalable alternative to GNN-based pipelines for fast tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop</p></details> |

While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+ achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA (3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICTAI 2025.

Adaptive meshes improve computational efficiency by refining resolution in critical regions, but typically require task-specific heuristics or cumbersome manual design by a human expert. We propose Adaptive Meshing By Expert Reconstruction (AMBER), a supervised learning approach to mesh adaptation. Starting from a coarse mesh, AMBER iteratively predicts the sizing field, i.e., a function mapping from the geometry to the local element size of the target mesh, and uses this prediction to produce a new intermediate mesh using an out-of-the-box mesh generator. This process is enabled through a hierarchical graph neural network, and relies on data augmentation by automatically projecting expert labels onto AMBER-generated data during training. We evaluate AMBER on 2D and 3D datasets, including classical physics problems, mechanical components, and real-world industrial designs with human expert meshes. AMBER generalizes to unseen geometries and consistently outperforms multiple recent baselines, including ones using Graph and Convolutional Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning-based approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS2025</p></details> |
| **[GNN-enhanced Traffic Anomaly Detection for Next-Generation SDN-Enabled Consumer Electronics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07109v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consumer electronics (CE) connected to the Internet of Things are susceptible to various attacks, including DDoS and web-based threats, which can compromise their functionality and facilitate remote hijacking. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to exploit CE for broader system attacks while enabling the propagation of malicious code across the CE network, resulting in device failures. Existing deep learning-based traffic anomaly detection systems exhibit high accuracy in traditional network environments but are often overly complex and reliant on static infrastructure, necessitating manual configuration and management. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable network model that integrates Software-defined Networking (SDN) and Compute First Networking (CFN) for next-generation CE networks. In this network model, we propose a Graph Neural Networks-based Network Anomaly Detection framework (GNN-NAD) that integrates SDN-based CE networks and enables the CFN architecture. GNN-NAD uniquely fuses a static, vulnerability-aware attack graph with dynamic traffic features, providing a holistic view of network security. The core of the framework is a GNN model (GSAGE) for graph representation learning, followed by a Random Forest (RF) classifier. This design (GSAGE+RF) demonstrates superior performance compared to existing feature selection methods. Experimental evaluations on CE environment reveal that GNN-NAD achieves superior metrics in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score, even with small sample sizes, exceeding the performance of current network anomaly detection methods. This work advances the security and efficiency of next-generation intelligent CE networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics. 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Graph Condensation: Advancing Data Versatility through Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17063v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing computation of training graph neural networks (GNNs) on large-scale graphs, graph condensation (GC) has emerged as a promising solution to synthesize a compact, substitute graph of the large-scale original graph for efficient GNN training. However, existing GC methods predominantly employ classification as the surrogate task for optimization, thus excessively relying on node labels and constraining their utility in label-sparsity scenarios. More critically, this surrogate task tends to overfit class-specific information within the condensed graph, consequently restricting the generalization capabilities of GC for other downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce Contrastive Graph Condensation (CTGC), which adopts a self-supervised surrogate task to extract critical, causal information from the original graph and enhance the cross-task generalizability of the condensed graph. Specifically, CTGC employs a dual-branch framework to disentangle the generation of the node attributes and graph structures, where a dedicated structural branch is designed to explicitly encode geometric information through nodes' positional embeddings. By implementing an alternating optimization scheme with contrastive loss terms, CTGC promotes the mutual enhancement of both branches and facilitates high-quality graph generation through the model inversion technique. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CTGC excels in handling various downstream tasks with a limited number of labels, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art GC methods.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |

Algorithms are integral to robotics and safety-critical applications due to their predictable and consistent performance through logical and mathematical principles. In contrast, while neural networks are highly adaptable, handling complex, high-dimensional data and generalising across tasks, they often lack interpretability and transparency in their internal computations. To bridge the two, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, NAR-*ICP, that learns the intermediate computations of classical ICP-based registration algorithms, extending the CLRS Benchmark. We evaluate our approach across real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating its flexibility in handling complex inputs, and its potential to be used within larger learning pipelines. Our method achieves superior performance compared to the baselines, even surpassing the algorithms it was trained on, further demonstrating its ability to generalise beyond the capabilities of traditional algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 16 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce MoRE-GNN (Multi-omics Relational Edge Graph Neural Network), a heterogeneous graph autoencoder that combines graph convolution and attention mechanisms to dynamically construct relational graphs directly from data. Evaluations on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that MoRE-GNN captures biologically meaningful relationships and outperforms existing methods, particularly in settings with strong inter-modality correlations. Furthermore, the learned representations allow for accurate downstream cross-modal predictions. While performance may vary with dataset complexity, MoRE-GNN offers an adaptive, scalable and interpretable framework for advancing multi-omics integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalization of Graph Neural Networks for AC Optimal Power Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06860v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) is computationally expensive for large-scale power systems, with conventional solvers requiring prohibitive solution times. Machine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable scalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose a Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models buses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as distinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for handling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN achieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot to thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap despite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also improves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to 10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical, generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print has been submitted for review</p></details> |

We propose a novel integration framework that enables effective fusion between powerful pre-trained text encoders and Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs). Our method enhances the alignment of textual and structural representations through a bidirectional fusion mechanism and contrastive node-level optimization. To evaluate the approach, we train two variants using different PLMs: Snowflake-Embed (state-of-the-art) and GTE-base, each paired with an R-GCN backbone. Experiments on five heterophilic benchmarks demonstrate that our integration method achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, surpassing existing GNN and large language model-based approaches. Notably, Snowflake-Embed + R-GCN improves accuracy on the Texas dataset by over 8\% and on Wisconsin by nearly 5\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our fusion strategy for advancing text-rich graph representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-Aware Compound-Protein Affinity Prediction via Graph Neural Network with Group Lasso Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03318v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end explainable models for structure-activity relationship (SAR) modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as the limited number of compound-protein interaction activity data for specific protein targets, and plenty of subtle changes in molecular configuration sites significantly affecting molecular properties. We exploit pairs of molecules with activity cliffs that share scaffolds but differ at substituent sites, characterized by large potency differences for specific protein targets. We propose a framework by implementing graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage property and structure information from activity cliff pairs to predict compound-protein affinity (i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). To enhance model performance and explainability, we train GNNs with structure-aware loss functions using group lasso and sparse group lasso regularizations, which prune and highlight molecular subgraphs relevant to activity differences. We applied this framework to activity cliff data of molecules targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (PDB IDs: 1O42, 2H8H, 4MXO). Our approach improved property prediction by integrating common and uncommon node information with sparse group lasso, as reflected in reduced root mean squared error (RMSE) and improved Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). Applying regularizations also enhances feature attribution for GNN by boosting graph-level global direction scores and improving atom-level coloring accuracy. These advances strengthen model interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly for identifying critical molecular substructures in lead optimization.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Spatiotemporal Graph Learning with Direct Volumetric Information Passing and Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18013v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven learning of physical systems has kindled significant attention, where many neural models have been developed. In particular, mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in modeling spatiotemporal dynamics across arbitrary geometric domains. However, the existing node-edge message-passing and aggregation mechanism in GNNs limits the representation learning ability. In this paper, we proposed a dual-module framework, Cell-embedded and Feature-enhanced Graph Neural Network (aka, CeFeGNN), for learning spatiotemporal dynamics. Specifically, we embed learnable cell attributions to the common node-edge message passing process, which better captures the spatial dependency of regional features. Such a strategy essentially upgrades the local aggregation scheme from first order (e.g., from edge to node) to a higher order (e.g., from volume and edge to node), which takes advantage of volumetric information in message passing. Meanwhile, a novel feature-enhanced block is designed to further improve the model's performance and alleviate the over-smoothness problem. Extensive experiments on various PDE systems and one real-world dataset demonstrate that CeFeGNN achieves superior performance compared with other baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing the Effect of Embedding Norms and Singular Values to Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06066v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e., adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size (i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds. This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of the GNN.</p></details> |  |

While NLI has developed many sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm: CDCL-NLI, which extends traditional NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 25,410 instances and spanning 26 languages. To address the limitations of previous methods on CDCL-NLI task, we further propose an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion with interpretability-aware prediction. Our approach leverages RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) within heterogeneous graph neural networks for cross-document context modeling, and employs a structure-aware semantic alignment based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI interpretability, we develop an EDU (Elementary Discourse Unit)-level attribution framework that produces extractive explanations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's superior performance, achieving significant improvements over both conventional NLI models as well as large language models. Our work sheds light on the study of NLI and will bring research interest on cross-document cross-lingual context understanding, hallucination elimination and interpretability inference.

| **[Uncertainty assessment in satellite-based greenhouse gas emissions estimates using emulated atmospheric transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05751v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales. However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their associated uncertainty. We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport "footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole fractions. While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks Truly Effective? A Causal Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05750v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly, aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However, whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21 datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses, with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes node classes more distinguishable. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/YXNTU/CausalHGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[QGraphLIME - Explaining Quantum Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05683v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum graph neural networks offer a powerful paradigm for learning on graph-structured data, yet their explainability is complicated by measurement-induced stochasticity and the combinatorial nature of graph structure. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design. Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world datasets, as quantum resources mature.

| **[Inductive inference of gradient-boosted decision trees on graphs for insurance fraud detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05676v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies. That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine (G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world, proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights into the predictions made by G-GBM.</p></details> |  |
