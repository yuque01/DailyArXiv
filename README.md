| **[SynerGen: Contextualized Generative Recommender for Unified Search and Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21777v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant retrieve-then-rank pipeline in large-scale recommender systems suffers from mis-calibration and engineering overhead due to its architectural split and differing optimization objectives. While recent generative sequence models have shown promise in unifying retrieval and ranking by auto-regressively generating ranked items, existing solutions typically address either personalized search or query-free recommendation, often exhibiting performance trade-offs when attempting to unify both. We introduce \textit{SynerGen}, a novel generative recommender model that bridges this critical gap by providing a single generative backbone for both personalized search and recommendation, while simultaneously excelling at retrieval and ranking tasks. Trained on behavioral sequences, our decoder-only Transformer leverages joint optimization with InfoNCE for retrieval and a hybrid pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking, allowing semantic signals from search to improve recommendation and vice versa. We also propose a novel time-aware rotary positional embedding to effectively incorporate time information into the attention mechanism. \textit{SynerGen} achieves significant improvements on widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong generative recommender and joint search and recommendation baselines. This work demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for industrial-scale unified information access.</p></details> | <details><summary>Gener...</summary><p>Generative Recommender, Recommendation System, Information Retrieval</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Static Testbeds: An Interaction-Centric Agent Simulation Platform for Dynamic Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16429v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating and iterating upon recommender systems is crucial, yet traditional A/B testing is resource-intensive, and offline methods struggle with dynamic user-platform interactions. While agent-based simulation is promising, existing platforms often lack a mechanism for user actions to dynamically reshape the environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce RecInter, a novel agent-based simulation platform for recommender systems featuring a robust interaction mechanism. In RecInter platform, simulated user actions (e.g., likes, reviews, purchases) dynamically update item attributes in real-time, and introduced Merchant Agents can reply, fostering a more realistic and evolving ecosystem. High-fidelity simulation is ensured through Multidimensional User Profiling module, Advanced Agent Architecture, and LLM fine-tuned on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enriched interaction data. Our platform achieves significantly improved simulation credibility and successfully replicates emergent phenomena like Brand Loyalty and the Matthew Effect. Experiments demonstrate that this interaction mechanism is pivotal for simulating realistic system evolution, establishing our platform as a credible testbed for recommender systems research. Our codes are available at https://github.com/jinsong8/RecInter.</p></details> | EMNLP2025 Main |
| **[Interactive Recommendation Agent with Active User Commands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21317v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Cascade! Human in the loop shortcomings can increase the risk of failures in recommender systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20099v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are among the most commonly deployed systems today. Systems design approaches to AI-powered recommender systems have done well to urge recommender system developers to follow more intentional data collection, curation, and management procedures. So too has the "human-in-the-loop" paradigm been widely adopted, primarily to address the issue of accountability. However, in this paper, we take the position that human oversight in recommender system design also entails novel risks that have yet to be fully described. These risks are "codetermined" by the information context in which such systems are often deployed. Furthermore, new knowledge of the shortcomings of "human-in-the-loop" practices to deliver meaningful oversight of other AI systems suggest that they may also be inadequate for achieving socially responsible recommendations. We review how the limitations of human oversight may increase the chances of a specific kind of failure: a "cascade" or "compound" failure. We then briefly explore how the unique dynamics of three common deployment contexts can make humans in the loop more likely to fail in their oversight duties. We then conclude with two recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rejuvenating Cross-Entropy Loss in Knowledge Distillation for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20989v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper analyzes Cross-Entropy (CE) loss in knowledge distillation (KD) for recommender systems. KD for recommender systems targets at distilling rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our goal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items. We empirically demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether they are highly ranked by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RCE-KD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Graph-Transformer Out-of-Distribution Generalization Abilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20575v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID) benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts. Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without specialized DG algorithms (on four out of six benchmarks). Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets, specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Highlighting its model-agnostic design, the method yielded valuable insights into both GT and MPNN backbones and appears well suited for broader DG applications beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Representation-disentangled Information Bottleneck for Multimodal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20225v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal data has significantly advanced recommendation systems by integrating diverse information sources to model user preferences and item characteristics. However, these systems often struggle with redundant and irrelevant information, which can degrade performance. Most existing methods either fuse multimodal information directly or use rigid architectural separation for disentanglement, failing to adequately filter noise and model the complex interplay between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, the Multimodal Representation-disentangled Information Bottleneck (MRdIB). Concretely, we first employ a Multimodal Information Bottleneck to compress the input representations, effectively filtering out task-irrelevant noise while preserving rich semantic information. Then, we decompose the information based on its relationship with the recommendation target into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. We achieve this decomposition with a series of constraints: a unique information learning objective to preserve modality-unique signals, a redundant information learning objective to minimize overlap, and a synergistic information learning objective to capture emergent information. By optimizing these objectives, MRdIB guides a model to learn more powerful and disentangled representations. Extensive experiments on several competitive models and three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our MRdIB in enhancing multimodal recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intelligent Algorithm Selection for Recommender Systems: Meta-Learning via in-depth algorithm feature engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20134v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The "No Free Lunch" theorem dictates that no single recommender algorithm is optimal for all users, creating a significant Algorithm Selection Problem. Standard meta-learning approaches aim to solve this by selecting an algorithm based on user features, but treat the fundamentally diverse algorithms themselves as equivalent, "black-box" choices. This thesis investigates the impact of overcoming this limitation by engineering a comprehensive feature set to explicitly characterize the algorithms themselves. We combine static code metrics, Abstract Syntax Tree properties, behavioral performance landmarks, and high-level conceptual features. We evaluate two meta-learners across five datasets: a baseline using only user features and our proposed model using both user and algorithm features. Our results show that the meta-learner augmented with algorithm features achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.143, a statistically significant improvement of 11.7% over the Single Best Algorithm baseline (0.128). However, we found that the inclusion of algorithm features did not lead to an improvement in overall NDCG@10 over the meta learner using only user features (0.144). While adding algorithm features to the meta-learner did improve its Top-1 selection accuracy (+16.1%), this was counterbalanced by leading to a lower Top-3 accuracy (-10.7%). We conclude that for the per-user algorithm selection task in recommender systems, the predictive power of user features is overwhelmingly dominant. While algorithm features improve selection precision, unlocking their potential to boost overall performance remains a non-trivial challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[UnifiedRL: A Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Tailored for Multi-Task Fusion in Large-Scale Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17589v6)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the last pivotal stage of Recommender System (RS), Multi-Task Fusion (MTF) is responsible for combining multiple scores outputted by Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model into a final score to maximize user satisfaction. Recently, to optimize long-term user satisfaction, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used for MTF in RSs. However, the existing offline RL algorithms used for MTF have the following severe problems: a) To avoid Out-of-Distribution (OOD), their constraints are overly strict, which seriously damage performance; b) They are unaware of the exploration policy used to collect training data, only suboptimal policy can be learned; c) Their exploration policies are inefficient and hurt user experience. To solve the above problems, we propose an innovative method called UnifiedRL tailored for MTF in large-scale RSs. UnifiedRL seamlessly integrates offline RL model with its custom exploration policy to relax overly strict constraints, which is different from existing RL-MTF methods and significantly improves performance. In addition, compared to existing exploration policies, UnifiedRL's custom exploration policy is highly efficient, enabling frequent online exploration and offline training iterations, which further improves performance. Extensive offline and online experiments are conducted in a large-scale RS. The results demonstrate that UnifiedRL outperforms other existing MTF methods remarkably, achieving a +4.64% increase in user valid consumption and a +1.74% increase in user duration time. To the best of our knowledge, UnifiedRL is the first RL algorithm tailored for MTF in RSs and has been successfully deployed in multiple large-scale RSs since June 2023, yielding significant benefits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Model Evolutionary Algorithms for Recommender Systems: Benchmarks and Algorithm Comparisons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10697v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolutionary computing community, the remarkable language-handling capabilities and reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the functionality of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), enabling them to tackle optimization problems involving structured language or program code. Although this field is still in its early stages, its impressive potential has led to the development of various LLM-based EAs. To effectively evaluate the performance and practical applicability of these LLM-based EAs, benchmarks with real-world relevance are essential. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based recommender systems (RSs) and introduce a benchmark problem set, named RSBench, specifically designed to assess the performance of LLM-based EAs in recommendation prompt optimization. RSBench emphasizes session-based recommendations, aiming to discover a set of Pareto optimal prompts that guide the recommendation process, providing accurate, diverse, and fair recommendations. We develop three LLM-based EAs based on established EA frameworks and experimentally evaluate their performance using RSBench. Our study offers valuable insights into the application of EAs in LLM-based RSs. Additionally, we explore key components that may influence the overall performance of the RS, providing meaningful guidance for future research on the development of LLM-based EAs in RSs. The source code of the proposed RSBench can be found at https://github.com/LiuJ-2023/RSBench/tree/main.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shilling Recommender Systems by Generating Side-feature-aware Fake User Profiles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17918v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RS) greatly influence users' consumption decisions, making them attractive targets for malicious shilling attacks that inject fake user profiles to manipulate recommendations. Existing shilling methods can generate effective and stealthy fake profiles when training data only contain rating matrix, but they lack comprehensive solutions for scenarios where side features are present and utilized by the recommender. To address this gap, we extend the Leg-UP framework by enhancing the generator architecture to incorporate side features, enabling the generation of side-feature-aware fake user profiles. Experiments on benchmarks show that our method achieves strong attack performance while maintaining stealthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal-enhanced Federated Recommendation: A Group-wise Fusion Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19955v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Recommendation (FR) is a new learning paradigm to tackle the learn-to-rank problem in a privacy-preservation manner. How to integrate multi-modality features into federated recommendation is still an open challenge in terms of efficiency, distribution heterogeneity, and fine-grained alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal fusion mechanism in federated recommendation settings (GFMFR). Specifically, it offloads multimodal representation learning to the server, which stores item content and employs a high-capacity encoder to generate expressive representations, alleviating client-side overhead. Moreover, a group-aware item representation fusion approach enables fine-grained knowledge sharing among similar users while retaining individual preferences. The proposed fusion loss could be simply plugged into any existing federated recommender systems empowering their capability by adding multi-modality features. Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that GFMFR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal FR baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equip Pre-ranking with Target Attention by Residual Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16931v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-ranking stage in industrial recommendation systems faces a fundamental conflict between efficiency and effectiveness. While powerful models like Target Attention (TA) excel at capturing complex feature interactions in the ranking stage, their high computational cost makes them infeasible for pre-ranking, which often relies on simplistic vector-product models. This disparity creates a significant performance bottleneck for the entire system. To bridge this gap, we propose TARQ, a novel pre-ranking framework. Inspired by generative models, TARQ's key innovation is to equip pre-ranking with an architecture approximate to TA by Residual Quantization. This allows us to bring the modeling power of TA into the latency-critical pre-ranking stage for the first time, establishing a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Extensive offline experiments and large-scale online A/B tests at Taobao demonstrate TARQ's significant improvements in ranking performance. Consequently, our model has been fully deployed in production, serving tens of millions of daily active users and yielding substantial business improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to WSDM 2026 Short Paper Track</p></details> |
| **[GSPRec: Temporal-Aware Graph Spectral Filtering for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11552v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based recommendation systems are effective at modeling collaborative patterns but often suffer from two limitations: overreliance on low-pass filtering, which suppresses user-specific signals, and omission of sequential dynamics in graph construction. We introduce GSPRec, a graph spectral model that integrates temporal transitions through sequentially-informed graph construction and applies frequency-aware filtering in the spectral domain. GSPRec encodes item transitions via multi-hop diffusion to enable the use of symmetric Laplacians for spectral processing. To capture user preferences, we design a dual-filtering mechanism: a Gaussian bandpass filter to extract mid-frequency, user-level patterns, and a low-pass filter to retain global trends. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that GSPRec consistently outperforms baselines, with an average improvement of 6.77% in NDCG@10. Ablation studies show the complementary benefits of both sequential graph augmentation and bandpass filtering.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Hidden Cost of Defaults in Recommender System Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21180v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperparameter optimization is critical for improving the performance of recommender systems, yet its implementation is often treated as a neutral or secondary concern. In this work, we shift focus from model benchmarking to auditing the behavior of RecBole, a widely used recommendation framework. We show that RecBole's internal defaults, particularly an undocumented early-stopping policy, can prematurely terminate Random Search and Bayesian Optimization. This limits search coverage in ways that are not visible to users. Using six models and two datasets, we compare search strategies and quantify both performance variance and search path instability. Our findings reveal that hidden framework logic can introduce variability comparable to the differences between search strategies. These results highlight the importance of treating frameworks as active components of experimental design and call for more transparent, reproducibility-aware tooling in recommender systems research. We provide actionable recommendations for researchers and developers to mitigate hidden configuration behaviors and improve the transparency of hyperparameter tuning workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RecSys 2025</p></details> |
| **[From latent factors to language: a user study on LLM-generated explanations for an inherently interpretable matrix-based recommender system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18980v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can generate effective, user-facing explanations from a mathematically interpretable recommendation model. The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations themselves.To evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary insights beyond the quantitative results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic User Interest Augmentation via Stream Clustering and Memory Networks in Large-Scale Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13238v7)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender System (RS) provides personalized recommendation service based on user interest. However, lots of users' interests are sparse due to lacking consumption behaviors, making it challenging to provide accurate recommendations for them, which is widespread in large-scale RSs. In particular, efficiently solving this problem in the ranking stage of RS is an even greater challenge, which requires an end-to-end and real-time approach. To solve this problem, we propose an innovative method called Dynamic User Interest Augmentation (DUIA). DUIA enhances user interest including user profile and user history behavior sequences by generating enhancement vectors and personalized enhancement vectors through dynamic stream clustering of similar users and relevant items from multiple perspectives. To realize stream clustering, we specially design an algorithm called Gradient-based Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm (GHCA) for DUIA, which performs clustering via gradient descent and stores the cluster centers in memory networks. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate that DUIA not only significantly improves model performance for users with sparse interests but also delivers notable gains for other users. As an end-to-end method, DUIA can be easily integrated with existing models. Furthermore, DUIA is also used for long-tail items and cold-start problem, which also yields excellent improvements. Since 2022, DUIA has been successfully deployed in multiple industrial RSs in Tencent and was made public in May 2024. Moreover, the thoughts behind DUIA, dynamic stream clustering and similarity-based enhancement, have inspired relevant works and have also been applied in other stages of RS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Branch Network Architectures to Close the Modality Gap in Multimodal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18807v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommender systems rely on collaborative filtering, using past user-item interactions to help users discover new items in a vast collection. In cold start, i.e., when interaction histories of users or items are not available, content-based recommender systems use side information instead. Hybrid recommender systems (HRSs) often employ multimodal learning to combine collaborative and side information, which we jointly refer to as modalities. Though HRSs can provide recommendations when some modalities are missing, their quality degrades. In this work, we utilize single-branch neural networks equipped with weight sharing, modality sampling, and contrastive loss to provide accurate recommendations even in missing modality scenarios by narrowing the modality gap. We compare these networks with multi-branch alternatives and conduct extensive experiments on three datasets. Six accuracy-based and four beyond-accuracy-based metrics help assess the recommendation quality for the different training paradigms and their hyperparameters in warm-start and missing modality scenarios. We quantitatively and qualitatively study the effects of these different aspects on bridging the modality gap. Our results show that single-branch networks achieve competitive performance in warm-start scenarios and are significantly better in missing modality settings. Moreover, our approach leads to closer proximity of an item's modalities in the embedding space. Our full experimental setup is available at https://github.com/hcai-mms/single-branch-networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (TORS)</p></details> |
| **[Denoising Neural Reranker for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18736v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For multi-stage recommenders in industry, a user request would first trigger a simple and efficient retriever module that selects and ranks a list of relevant items, then the recommender calls a slower but more sophisticated reranking model that refines the item list exposure to the user. To consistently optimize the two-stage retrieval reranking framework, most efforts have focused on learning reranker-aware retrievers. In contrast, there has been limited work on how to achieve a retriever-aware reranker. In this work, we provide evidence that the retriever scores from the previous stage are informative signals that have been underexplored. Specifically, we first empirically show that the reranking task under the two-stage framework is naturally a noise reduction problem on the retriever scores, and theoretically show the limitations of naive utilization techniques of the retriever scores. Following this notion, we derive an adversarial framework DNR that associates the denoising reranker with a carefully designed noise generation module. The resulting DNR solution extends the conventional score error minimization loss with three augmented objectives, including: 1) a denoising objective that aims to denoise the noisy retriever scores to align with the user feedback; 2) an adversarial retriever score generation objective that improves the exploration in the retriever score space; and 3) a distribution regularization term that aims to align the distribution of generated noisy retriever scores with the real ones. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets and an industrial recommender system, together with analytical support, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed DNR.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the challenge of defining noise, which is inherently related to variability in human preferences and behaviors. In classifying changes in user tendencies, we distinguish three kinds of phenomena: external factors that directly influence users' sentiment, serendipity causing unexpected preference, and incidental interaction perceived as noise. To overcome these problems, we present a new framework that identifies noisy ratings. In this context, the proposed framework is modular, consisting of three layers: known natural noise algorithms for item classification, an Ensemble learning model for refined evaluation of the items and signature-based noise identification. We further advocate the metrics that quantitatively assess serendipity and group validation, offering higher robustness in recommendation accuracy. Our approach aims to provide a cleaner training dataset that would inherently improve user satisfaction and engagement with Recommender Systems.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[Actions Speak Louder than Prompts: A Large-Scale Study of LLMs for Graph Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18487v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for text-rich graph machine learning tasks such as node classification in high-impact domains like fraud detection and recommendation systems. Yet, despite a surge of interest, the field lacks a principled understanding of the capabilities of LLMs in their interaction with graph data. In this work, we conduct a large-scale, controlled evaluation across several key axes of variability to systematically assess the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based graph reasoning methods in text-based applications. The axes include the LLM-graph interaction mode, comparing prompting, tool-use, and code generation; dataset domains, spanning citation, web-link, e-commerce, and social networks; structural regimes contrasting homophilic and heterophilic graphs; feature characteristics involving both short- and long-text node attributes; and model configurations with varying LLM sizes and reasoning capabilities. We further analyze dependencies by methodically truncating features, deleting edges, and removing labels to quantify reliance on input types. Our findings provide practical and actionable guidance. (1) LLMs as code generators achieve the strongest overall performance on graph data, with especially large gains on long-text or high-degree graphs where prompting quickly exceeds the token budget. (2) All interaction strategies remain effective on heterophilic graphs, challenging the assumption that LLM-based methods collapse under low homophily. (3) Code generation is able to flexibly adapt its reliance between structure, features, or labels to leverage the most informative input type. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive view of the strengths and limitations of current LLM-graph interaction modes and highlight key design principles for future approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[OnePiece: Bringing Context Engineering and Reasoning to Industrial Cascade Ranking System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18091v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the growing interest in replicating the scaled success of large language models (LLMs) in industrial search and recommender systems, most existing industrial efforts remain limited to transplanting Transformer architectures, which bring only incremental improvements over strong Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs). From a first principle perspective, the breakthroughs of LLMs stem not only from their architectures but also from two complementary mechanisms: context engineering, which enriches raw input queries with contextual cues to better elicit model capabilities, and multi-step reasoning, which iteratively refines model outputs through intermediate reasoning paths. However, these two mechanisms and their potential to unlock substantial improvements remain largely underexplored in industrial ranking systems. In this paper, we propose OnePiece, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into both retrieval and ranking models of industrial cascaded pipelines. OnePiece is built on a pure Transformer backbone and further introduces three key innovations: (1) structured context engineering, which augments interaction history with preference and scenario signals and unifies them into a structured tokenized input sequence for both retrieval and ranking; (2) block-wise latent reasoning, which equips the model with multi-step refinement of representations and scales reasoning bandwidth via block size; (3) progressive multi-task training, which leverages user feedback chains to effectively supervise reasoning steps during training. OnePiece has been deployed in the main personalized search scenario of Shopee and achieves consistent online gains across different key business metrics, including over $+2\%$ GMV/UU and a $+2.90\%$ increase in advertising revenue.</p></details> | <details><summary>OnePi...</summary><p>OnePiece Technical Report; Applied in Shopee</p></details> |
| **[Serendipitous Recommendation with Multimodal LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08283v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional recommendation systems succeed in identifying relevant content but often fail to provide users with surprising or novel items. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) possess the world knowledge and multimodal understanding needed for serendipity, but their integration into billion-item-scale platforms presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework where fine-tuned MLLMs provide high-level guidance to conventional recommendation models, steering them towards more serendipitous suggestions. This approach leverages MLLM strengths in understanding multimodal content and user interests while retaining the efficiency of traditional models for item-level recommendation. This mitigates the complexity of applying MLLMs directly to vast action spaces. We also demonstrate a chain-of-thought strategy enabling MLLMs to discover novel user interests by first understanding video content and then identifying relevant yet unexplored interest clusters. Through live experiments within a commercial short-form video platform serving billions of users, we show that our MLLM-powered approach significantly improves both recommendation serendipity and user satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 Recsys EARL Workshop</p></details> |

However, existing solutions either require domain-specific engineering, which limits flexibility, or rely solely on large language models, which increases the risk of hallucination. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) holds promise, its naive use in CRS is hindered by noisy dialogues that weaken retrieval and by overlooked nuances among similar items. We propose ReGeS, a reciprocal Retrieval-Generation Synergy framework that unifies generation-augmented retrieval to distill informative user intent from conversations and retrieval-augmented generation to differentiate subtle item features. This synergy obviates the need for extra annotations, reduces hallucinations, and simplifies continuous updates. Experiments on multiple CRS benchmarks show that ReGeS achieves state-of-the-art performance in recommendation accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of reciprocal synergy for knowledge-intensive CRS tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WISE 2025: 26th International Web Information Systems Engineering conference.

| **[Core-elements Subsampling for Alternating Least Squares](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18024v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel element-wise subset selection method for the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm, focusing on low-rank matrix factorization involving matrices with missing values, as commonly encountered in recommender systems. While ALS is widely used for providing personalized recommendations based on user-item interaction data, its high computational cost, stemming from repeated regression operations, poses significant challenges for large-scale datasets. To enhance the efficiency of ALS, we propose a core-elements subsampling method that selects a representative subset of data and leverages sparse matrix operations to approximate ALS estimations efficiently. We establish theoretical guarantees for the approximation and convergence of the proposed approach, showing that it achieves similar accuracy with significantly reduced computational time compared to full-data ALS. Extensive simulations and real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various scenarios, emphasizing its potential in large-scale recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |

Past research on predicting the popularity of individual products suggests the existence of intrinsic prediction limits. However, little is known about the limits for predicting collective attention across cultural products. Here, we analyze four years of nationwide library loan data for approximately 2 million individuals, comprising over 100 million loans of more than 660,000 unique books. We find that culture, as measured by popularity distributions of loaned books, drifts continually from month to month at a near-constant rate, leading to a growing divergence over time, and that drifts vary between different book genres. By linking book loans to registry data, we investigate the influence of age, sex, educational level, and geographical area on cultural drift, finding heterogeneous effects from the different demographic groups. Our findings have important implications for market forecasting and developing robust recommender systems, highlighting the need to account for specific drift dynamics for different types of items and demographic groups.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeqUDA-Rec: Sequential User Behavior Enhanced Recommendation via Global Unsupervised Data Augmentation for Personalized Content Marketing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17361v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized content marketing has become a crucial strategy for digital platforms, aiming to deliver tailored advertisements and recommendations that match user preferences. Traditional recommendation systems often suffer from two limitations: (1) reliance on limited supervised signals derived from explicit user feedback, and (2) vulnerability to noisy or unintentional interactions. To address these challenges, we propose SeqUDA-Rec, a novel deep learning framework that integrates user behavior sequences with global unsupervised data augmentation to enhance recommendation accuracy and robustness. Our approach first constructs a Global User-Item Interaction Graph (GUIG) from all user behavior sequences, capturing both local and global item associations. Then, a graph contrastive learning module is applied to generate robust embeddings, while a sequential Transformer-based encoder models users' evolving preferences. To further enhance diversity and counteract sparse supervised labels, we employ a GAN-based augmentation strategy, generating plausible interaction patterns and supplementing training data. Extensive experiments on two real-world marketing datasets (Amazon Ads and TikTok Ad Clicks) demonstrate that SeqUDA-Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as SASRec, BERT4Rec, and GCL4SR. Our model achieves a 6.7% improvement in NDCG@10 and 11.3% improvement in HR@10, proving its effectiveness in personalized advertising and intelligent content recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying and Upweighting Power-Niche Users to Mitigate Popularity Bias in Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17265v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have been shown to exhibit popularity bias by over-recommending popular items and under-recommending relevant niche items. We seek to understand interactions with niche items in benchmark recommendation datasets as a step toward mitigating popularity bias. We find that, compared to mainstream users, niche-preferring users exhibit a longer-tailed activity-level distribution, indicating the existence of users who both prefer niche items and exhibit high activity levels. We partition users along two axes: (1) activity level ("power" vs. "light") and (2) item-popularity preference ("mainstream" vs. "niche"), and show that in several benchmark datasets, the number of power-niche users (high activity and niche preference) is statistically significantly larger than expected under a null configuration model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a framework for reweighting the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss that simultaneously reweights based on user activity level and item popularity. Our method introduces two interpretable parameters: one controlling the significance of user activity level, and the other of item popularity. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that upweighting power-niche users reduces popularity bias and can increase overall performance. In contrast to previous work that only considers user activity level or item popularity in isolation, our results suggest that considering their interaction leads to Pareto-dominant performance.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems risk reinforcing filter bubbles and political polarization by failing to incorporate diverse perspectives. Stance detection -- identifying a text's position on a target -- can help mitigate this by enabling viewpoint-aware recommendations and data-driven analyses of media bias. Yet, existing stance detection research remains largely limited to short texts and high-resource languages. To address these gaps, we introduce \textsc{K-News-Stance}, the first Korean dataset for article-level stance detection, comprising 2,000 news articles with article-level and 21,650 segment-level stance annotations across 47 societal issues. We also propose \textsc{JoA-ICL}, a \textbf{Jo}urnalism-guided \textbf{A}gentic \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{L}earning framework that employs a language model agent to predict the stances of key structural segments (e.g., leads, quotations), which are then aggregated to infer the overall article stance. Experiments showed that \textsc{JoA-ICL} outperforms existing stance detection methods, highlighting the benefits of segment-level agency in capturing the overall position of long-form news articles. Two case studies further demonstrate its broader utility in promoting viewpoint diversity in news recommendations and uncovering patterns of media bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (24 pages)</p></details> |
| **[Temporal-Aware User Behaviour Simulation with Large Language Models for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16895v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-like capabilities in language understanding, reasoning, and generation, driving interest in using LLM-based agents to simulate human feedback in recommender systems. However, most existing approaches rely on static user profiling, neglecting the temporal and dynamic nature of user interests. This limitation stems from a disconnect between language modelling and behaviour modelling, which constrains the capacity of agents to represent sequential patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Temporal-aware Agent-based simulator for Recommender Systems, DyTA4Rec, which enables agents to model and utilise evolving user behaviour based on historical interactions. DyTA4Rec features a dynamic updater for real-time profile refinement, temporal-enhanced prompting for sequential context, and self-adaptive aggregation for coherent feedback. Experimental results at group and individual levels show that DyTA4Rec significantly improves the alignment between simulated and actual user behaviour by modelling dynamic characteristics and enhancing temporal awareness in LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[USB-Rec: An Effective Framework for Improving Conversational Recommendation Capability of Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20381v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework, User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy (SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Recsys'25</p></details> |

Personalized Large Language Models (PLLMs) tackle these challenges by leveraging individual user data, such as user profiles, historical dialogues, content, and interactions, to deliver responses that are contextually relevant and tailored to each user's specific needs. This is a highly valuable research topic, as PLLMs can significantly enhance user satisfaction and have broad applications in conversational agents, recommendation systems, emotion recognition, medical assistants, and more. This survey reviews recent advancements in PLLMs from three technical perspectives: prompting for personalized context (input level), finetuning for personalized adapters (model level), and alignment for personalized preferences (objective level). To provide deeper insights, we also discuss current limitations and outline several promising directions for future research.

Such big models are not only strong performers in practice but also offer a promising way to break out of the task-specific modeling restrictions, thereby enabling task-agnostic and unified ML systems. However, such a popular paradigm is mainly unexplored by the recommender systems (RS) community. A critical issue is that standard recommendation models are primarily built on categorical identity features. That is, the users and the interacted items are represented by their unique IDs, which are generally not shareable across different systems or platforms. To pursue the transferable recommendations, we propose studying pre-trained RS models in a novel scenario where a user's interaction feedback involves a mixture-of-modality (MoM) items, e.g., text and images. We then present TransRec, a very simple modification made on the popular ID-based RS framework. TransRec learns directly from the raw features of the MoM items in an end-to-end training manner and thus enables effective transfer learning under various scenarios without relying on overlapped users or items. We empirically study the transferring ability of TransRec across four different real-world recommendation settings. Besides, we look at its effects by scaling source and target data size. Our results suggest that learning neural recommendation models from MoM feedback provides a promising way to realize universal RS.</p></details> |  |

To provide personalized recommendations tailored to individual interests, the proposed system considers user interaction data, video content features, and contextual information. With the aid of a hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, the system can capture nuanced relationships between users, video attributes, and engagement patterns. Three datasets are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system: Kwai, TikTok, and MovieLens. Compared to baseline models, such as DeepFM, Wide & Deep, LightGBM, and XGBoost, the proposed MMGCN-based model shows superior performance. A notable feature of the proposed model is that it outperforms all baseline methods in capturing diverse user preferences and making accurate, personalized recommendations, resulting in a Kwai F1 score of 0.574, a Tiktok F1 score of 0.506, and a MovieLens F1 score of 0.197. We emphasize the importance of multi-modal integration and user-centric approaches in advancing recommender systems, emphasizing the role they play in enhancing content discovery and audience interaction on live broadcast platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Long-term User Behaviors with Diffusion-driven Multi-interest Network for CTR Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15311v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CTR (Click-Through Rate) prediction, crucial for recommender systems and online advertising, etc., has been confirmed to benefit from modeling long-term user behaviors. Nonetheless, the vast number of behaviors and complexity of noise interference pose challenges to prediction efficiency and effectiveness. Recent solutions have evolved from single-stage models to two-stage models. However, current two-stage models often filter out significant information, resulting in an inability to capture diverse user interests and build the complete latent space of user interests. Inspired by multi-interest and generative modeling, we propose DiffuMIN (Diffusion-driven Multi-Interest Network) to model long-term user behaviors and thoroughly explore the user interest space. Specifically, we propose a target-oriented multi-interest extraction method that begins by orthogonally decomposing the target to obtain interest channels. This is followed by modeling the relationships between interest channels and user behaviors to disentangle and extract multiple user interests. We then adopt a diffusion module guided by contextual interests and interest channels, which anchor users' personalized and target-oriented interest types, enabling the generation of augmented interests that align with the latent spaces of user interests, thereby further exploring restricted interest space. Finally, we leverage contrastive learning to ensure that the generated augmented interests align with users' genuine preferences. Extensive offline experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, yielding results that demonstrate the superiority of DiffuMIN. Moreover, DiffuMIN increased CTR by 1.52% and CPM by 1.10% in online A/B testing. Our source code is available at https://github.com/laiweijiang/DiffuMIN.</p></details> |  |

Target-free User Simulation for Evaluating Conversational Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16160v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have tried to simulate real-world users engaging in conversations with CRSs to create more realistic testing environments that reflect the complexity of human-agent dialogue. Despite the significant advancements, reliably evaluating the capability of CRSs to elicit user preferences still faces a significant challenge. Existing evaluation metrics often rely on target-biased user simulators that assume users have predefined preferences, leading to interactions that devolve into simplistic guessing game. These simulators typically guide the CRS toward specific target items based on fixed attributes, limiting the dynamic exploration of user preferences and struggling to capture the evolving nature of real-user interactions. Additionally, current evaluation metrics are predominantly focused on single-turn recall of target items, neglecting the intermediate processes of preference elicitation. To address this, we introduce PEPPER, a novel CRS evaluation protocol with target-free user simulators constructed from real-user interaction histories and reviews. PEPPER enables realistic user-CRS dialogues without falling into simplistic guessing games, allowing users to gradually discover their preferences through enriched interactions, thereby providing a more accurate and reliable assessment of the CRS's ability to elicit personal preferences. Furthermore, PEPPER presents detailed measures for comprehensively evaluating the preference elicitation capabilities of CRSs, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative measures that capture four distinct aspects of the preference elicitation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the validity of PEPPER as a simulation environment and conduct a thorough analysis of how effectively existing CRSs perform in preference elicitation and recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Most research in RS tends to focus either on predicting users' immediate feedback (like click-through rate) accurately or improving users' long-term engagement. However, they ignore the influence for authors and the lifelong interaction value (LIV) of user-author pairs, which is particularly crucial for improving the prosperity of social community in short-video platforms. Currently, reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize long-term benefits and has been widely applied in RS. In this paper, we introduce RL to Reinforce Lifelong Interaction Value of User-Author pairs (RLIV-UA) based on each interaction of UA pairs. To address the long intervals between UA interactions and the large scale of the UA space, we propose a novel Sparse Cross-Request Interaction Markov Decision Process (SCRI-MDP) and introduce an Adjacent State Approximation (ASA) method to construct RL training samples. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Task Critic Learning (MTCL) to capture the progressive nature of UA interactions (click -> follow -> gift), where denser interaction signals are leveraged to compensate for the learning of sparse labels. Finally, an auxiliary supervised learning task is designed to enhance the convergence of the RLIV-UA model. In offline experiments and online A/B tests, the RLIV-UA model achieves both higher user satisfaction and higher platform profits than compared methods.</p></details> |  |

A Systematic Analysis of Prompts, Models, and Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14979v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantic features has been demonstrated as a powerful paradigm for enhancing Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS). This typically involves three stages: processing item text, extracting features with LLMs, and adapting them for downstream models. However, existing methods vary widely in prompting, architecture, and adaptation strategies, making it difficult to fairly compare design choices and identify what truly drives performance. In this work, we propose RecXplore, a modular analytical framework that decomposes the LLM-as-feature-extractor pipeline into four modules: data processing, semantic feature extraction, feature adaptation, and sequential modeling. Instead of proposing new techniques, RecXplore revisits and organizes established methods, enabling systematic exploration of each module in isolation. Experiments on four public datasets show that simply combining the best designs from existing techniques without exhaustive search yields up to 18.7% relative improvement in NDCG@5 and 12.7% in HR@5 over strong baselines. These results underscore the utility of modular benchmarking for identifying effective design patterns and promoting standardized research in LLM-enhanced recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages.

While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient information interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially address this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture user intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into generative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance. However, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic representations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning pathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these issues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that constructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a self-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations. Specifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook (MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby constructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance the reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement stage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a Multi-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions tailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA introduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization. During inference, Consistency-Oriented Self-Reflection for Pruning (CORP) is proposed to discard inconsistent reasoning paths, preventing the propagation of erroneous reasoning. Lastly, we develop an efficient offline training strategy for large-scale recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets and online evaluations show that REG4Rec delivers outstanding performance and substantial practical value.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have proposed methods to measure and mitigate such biases -- but translating academic theory into practice is inherently challenging. RS practitioners must balance the competing interests of diverse stakeholders, including providers and users, and operate in dynamic environments. Through a semi-structured interview study (N=11), we map the RS practitioner workflow within large technology companies, focusing on how technical teams consider fairness internally and in collaboration with other (legal, data, and fairness) teams. We identify key challenges to incorporating fairness into existing RS workflows: defining fairness in RS contexts, particularly when navigating multi-stakeholder and dynamic fairness considerations. We also identify key organization-wide challenges: making time for fairness work and facilitating cross-team communication. Finally, we offer actionable recommendations for the RS community, including HCI researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

We introduce OBER-an Outcome-Based Educational Recommender that embeds learning outcomes and assessment items directly into the data schema, so any algorithm can be evaluated on the mastery it fosters. OBER uses a minimalist entity-relation model, a log-driven mastery formula, and a plug-in architecture. Integrated into an e-learning system in non-formal domain, it was evaluated trough a two-week randomized split test with over 5 700 learners across three methods: fixed expert trajectory, collaborative filtering (CF), and knowledge-based (KB) filtering. CF maximized retention, but the fixed path achieved the highest mastery. Because OBER derives business, relevance, and learning metrics from the same logs, it lets practitioners weigh relevance and engagement against outcome mastery with no extra testing overhead. The framework is method-agnostic and readily extensible to future adaptive or context-aware recommenders.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards a Real-World Aligned Benchmark for Unlearning in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17076v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern recommender systems heavily leverage user interaction data to deliver personalized experiences. However, relying on personal data presents challenges in adhering to privacy regulations, such as the GDPR's "right to be forgotten". Machine unlearning (MU) aims to address these challenges by enabling the efficient removal of specific training data from models post-training, without compromising model utility or leaving residual information. However, current benchmarks for unlearning in recommender systems -- most notably CURE4Rec -- fail to reflect real-world operational demands. They focus narrowly on collaborative filtering, overlook tasks like session-based and next-basket recommendation, simulate unrealistically large unlearning requests, and ignore critical efficiency constraints. In this paper, we propose a set of design desiderata and research questions to guide the development of a more realistic benchmark for unlearning in recommender systems, with the goal of gathering feedback from the research community. Our benchmark proposal spans multiple recommendation tasks, includes domain-specific unlearning scenarios, and several unlearning algorithms -- including ones adapted from a recent NeurIPS unlearning competition. Furthermore, we argue for an unlearning setup that reflects the sequential, time-sensitive nature of real-world deletion requests. We also present a preliminary experiment in a next-basket recommendation setting based on our proposed desiderata and find that unlearning also works for sequential recommendation models, exposed to many small unlearning requests. In this case, we observe that a modification of a custom-designed unlearning algorithm for recommender systems outperforms general unlearning algorithms significantly, and that unlearning can be executed with a latency of only several seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unified and Adaptive Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering via Graph Signal Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12374v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a foundational approach in recommender systems, but it struggles with challenges such as data sparsity and the cold-start problem. Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has emerged as a promising solution by leveraging dense domains to improve recommendations in sparse target domains. However, existing CDR methods face significant limitations, including their reliance on overlapping users as a bridge between domains and their inability to address domain sensitivity, i.e., differences in user behaviors and characteristics across domains, effectively. To overcome these limitations, we propose CGSP, a unified and adaptive CDR framework based on graph signal processing (GSP). CGSP supports both intra-domain and inter-domain recommendations while adaptively controlling the influence of the source domain through a simple hyperparameter. The framework constructs a cross-domain similarity graph by integrating target-only and source-bridged similarity graphs to capture both intra-domain and inter-domain relationships. This graph is then processed through graph filtering techniques to propagate and enhance local signals. Finally, personalized graph signals are constructed, tailored separately for users in the source and target domains, enabling CGSP to function as a unified framework for CDR scenarios. Extensive evaluation shows that CGSP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse cross-domain settings, with notable gains in low-overlap scenarios, underscoring its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

These systems also serve as components of dialogue, question-answering, and recommender systems. The trajectory of IR has evolved dynamically from its origins in term-based methods to its integration with advanced neural models. While the neural models excel at capturing complex contextual signals and semantic nuances, thereby reshaping the IR landscape, they still face challenges such as data scarcity, interpretability, and the generation of contextually plausible yet potentially inaccurate responses. This evolution requires a combination of both traditional methods (such as term-based sparse retrieval methods with rapid response) and modern neural architectures (such as language models with powerful language understanding capacity). Meanwhile, the emergence of large language models (LLMs), typified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized natural language processing due to their remarkable language understanding, generation, generalization, and reasoning abilities. Consequently, recent research has sought to leverage LLMs to improve IR systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research trajectory, it is necessary to consolidate existing methodologies and provide nuanced insights through a comprehensive overview. In this survey, we delve into the confluence of LLMs and IR systems, including crucial aspects such as query rewriters, retrievers, rerankers, and readers. Additionally, we explore promising directions, such as search agents, within this expanding field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated to version 4; Accepted by ACM TOIS</p></details> |

Motivated by applications in clinical trials and recommendation systems, we assume that two arms are connected if and only if they are similar (i.e., their means are close to each other). We establish a regret lower bound for this problem under the novel feedback structure and introduce two upper confidence bound (UCB)-based algorithms: Double-UCB, which has problem-independent regret upper bounds, and Conservative-UCB, which has problem-dependent upper bounds. Leveraging the similarity structure, we also explore a scenario where the number of arms increases over time (referred to as the \emph{ballooning setting}). Practical applications of this scenario include Q\&A platforms (e.g., Reddit, Stack Overflow, Quora) and product reviews on platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, where answers (or reviews) continuously appear, and the goal is to display the best ones at the top. We extend these two UCB-based algorithms to the ballooning setting. Under mild assumptions, we provide regret upper bounds for both algorithms and discuss their sub-linearity. Furthermore, we propose a new version of the corresponding algorithms that do not rely on prior knowledge of the graph's structural information and provide regret upper bounds. Finally, we conduct experiments to validate the theoretical results.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.11171</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Cold-Start Recommendation via BPE Token-Level Embedding Initialization with LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13179v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems, especially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new users or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as conventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment with shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation strategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by applying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained token-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to using coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can be used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate recommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our mechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over benchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings show that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit Rate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same capability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more interpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The practical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight, but nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the zero-shot setting is indicated within this work.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, the recommender systems community hardly understands, addresses, and evaluates the environmental impact of their work. In this study, we examine the environmental impact of recommender systems research by reproducing typical experimental pipelines. Based on our results, we provide guidelines for researchers and practitioners on how to minimize the environmental footprint of their work and implement green recommender systems - recommender systems designed to minimize their energy consumption and carbon footprint. Our analysis covers 79 papers from the 2013 and 2023 ACM RecSys conferences, comparing traditional "good old-fashioned AI" models with modern deep learning models. We designed and reproduced representative experimental pipelines for both years, measuring energy consumption using a hardware energy meter and converting it into CO2 equivalents. Our results show that papers utilizing deep learning models emit approximately 42 times more CO2 equivalents than papers using traditional models. On average, a single deep learning-based paper generates 2,909 kilograms of CO2 equivalents - more than the carbon emissions of a person flying from New York City to Melbourne or the amount of CO2 sequestered by one tree over 260 years. This work underscores the urgent need for the recommender systems and wider machine learning communities to adopt green AI principles, balancing algorithmic advancements and environmental responsibility to build a sustainable future with AI-powered personalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Just ...</summary><p>Just Accepted at ACM TORS. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2408.08203</p></details> |
| **[A Learnable Fully Interacted Two-Tower Model for Pre-Ranking System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12948v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-ranking plays a crucial role in large-scale recommender systems by significantly improving the efficiency and scalability within the constraints of providing high-quality candidate sets in real time. The two-tower model is widely used in pre-ranking systems due to a good balance between efficiency and effectiveness with decoupled architecture, which independently processes user and item inputs before calculating their interaction (e.g. dot product or similarity measure). However, this independence also leads to the lack of information interaction between the two towers, resulting in less effectiveness. In this paper, a novel architecture named learnable Fully Interacted Two-tower Model (FIT) is proposed, which enables rich information interactions while ensuring inference efficiency. FIT mainly consists of two parts: Meta Query Module (MQM) and Lightweight Similarity Scorer (LSS). Specifically, MQM introduces a learnable item meta matrix to achieve expressive early interaction between user and item features. Moreover, LSS is designed to further obtain effective late interaction between the user and item towers. Finally, experimental results on several public datasets show that our proposed FIT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline pre-ranking models.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneRec Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13695v4)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have been widely used in various large-scale user-oriented platforms for many years. However, compared to the rapid developments in the AI community, recommendation systems have not achieved a breakthrough in recent years. For instance, they still rely on a multi-stage cascaded architecture rather than an end-to-end approach, leading to computational fragmentation and optimization inconsistencies, and hindering the effective application of key breakthrough technologies from the AI community in recommendation scenarios. To address these issues, we propose OneRec, which reshapes the recommendation system through an end-to-end generative approach and achieves promising results. Firstly, we have enhanced the computational FLOPs of the current recommendation model by 10 $\times$ and have identified the scaling laws for recommendations within certain boundaries. Secondly, reinforcement learning techniques, previously difficult to apply for optimizing recommendations, show significant potential in this framework. Lastly, through infrastructure optimizations, we have achieved 23.7% and 28.8% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) on flagship GPUs during training and inference, respectively, aligning closely with the LLM community. This architecture significantly reduces communication and storage overhead, resulting in operating expense that is only 10.6% of traditional recommendation pipelines. Deployed in Kuaishou/Kuaishou Lite APP, it handles 25% of total queries per second, enhancing overall App Stay Time by 0.54% and 1.24%, respectively. Additionally, we have observed significant increases in metrics such as 7-day Lifetime, which is a crucial indicator of recommendation experience. We also provide practical lessons and insights derived from developing, optimizing, and maintaining a production-scale recommendation system with significant real-world impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed alphabetically by their first name</p></details> |

OneRec reformulates recommendation as an autoregressive generation task, achieving high Model FLOPs Utilization. While OneRec-V1 has shown significant empirical success in real-world deployment, two critical challenges hinder its scalability and performance: (1) inefficient computational allocation where 97.66% of resources are consumed by sequence encoding rather than generation, and (2) limitations in reinforcement learning relying solely on reward models. To address these challenges, we propose OneRec-V2, featuring: (1) Lazy Decoder-Only Architecture: Eliminates encoder bottlenecks, reducing total computation by 94% and training resources by 90%, enabling successful scaling to 8B parameters. (2) Preference Alignment with Real-World User Interactions: Incorporates Duration-Aware Reward Shaping and Adaptive Ratio Clipping to better align with user preferences using real-world feedback. Extensive A/B tests on Kuaishou demonstrate OneRec-V2's effectiveness, improving App Stay Time by 0.467%/0.741% while balancing multi-objective recommendations. This work advances generative recommendation scalability and alignment with real-world feedback, representing a step forward in the development of end-to-end recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

However, current neural network-based models often incur significant computational overhead due to the complex training process required to learn and integrate information from multiple modalities. To address this challenge,we propose MultiModal-Graph Filtering (MM-GF), a training-free method grounded in graph filtering (GF) for efficient and accurate multimodal recommendations. Specifically, MM-GF first constructs multiple similarity graphs for two distinct modalities as well as user-item interaction data. Then, MM-GF optimally fuses these multimodal signals using a polynomial graph filter that allows for precise control of the frequency response by adjusting frequency bounds. Furthermore, the filter coefficients are treated as hyperparameters, enabling flexible and data-driven adaptation. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GF not only improves recommendation accuracy by up to 22.25% compared to the best competitor but also dramatically reduces computational costs by achieving the runtime of less than 10 seconds.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high. We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2 and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system comparisons. Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically principled, evaluation framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EARL 25: The 2nd Workshop on Evaluating and Applying Recommender Systems with Large Language Models at RecSys 2025</p></details> |

We report on our experience trying to apply the news recommendation literature to build POPROX, a live platform for news recommendation research, and reflect on the extent to which the current state of research supports system-building efforts. Our experience highlights several unexpected challenges encountered in building personalization features that are commonly found in products from news aggregators and publishers, and shows how those difficulties are connected to surprising gaps in the literature. Finally, we offer a set of lessons learned from building a live system with a persistent user base and highlight opportunities to make future news recommendation research more applicable and impactful in practice.</p></details> |  |

However, despite significant research advances, state-of-the-art VQ methods still face challenges in balancing encoding efficiency and quantization accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VQ method called SAQ. To improve accuracy, SAQ employs a new dimension segmentation technique to strategically partition PCA-projected vectors into segments along their dimensions. By prioritizing leading dimension segments with larger magnitudes, SAQ allocates more bits to high-impact segments, optimizing the use of the available space quota. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed to optimize dimension segmentation and bit allocation, ensuring minimal quantization error. To speed up vector encoding, SAQ devises a code adjustment technique to first quantize each dimension independently and then progressively refine quantized vectors using a coordinate-descent-like approach to avoid exhaustive enumeration. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAQ's superiority over classical methods (e.g., PQ, PCA) and recent state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., LVQ, Extended RabitQ). SAQ achieves up to 80% reduction in quantization error and accelerates encoding speed by over 80x compared to Extended RabitQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, accepted by SIGMOD</p></details> |
| **[AEFS: Adaptive Early Feature Selection for Deep Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12076v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature selection has emerged as a crucial technique in refining recommender systems. Recent advancements leveraging Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has drawn significant attention, particularly in two main categories: early feature selection and late feature selection, differentiated by whether the selection occurs before or after the embedding layer. The early feature selection selects a fixed subset of features and retrains the model, while the late feature selection, known as adaptive feature selection, dynamically adjusts feature choices for each data instance, recognizing the variability in feature significance. Although adaptive feature selection has shown remarkable improvements in performance, its main drawback lies in its post-embedding layer feature selection. This process often becomes cumbersome and inefficient in large-scale recommender systems with billions of ID-type features, leading to a highly sparse and parameter-heavy embedding layer. To overcome this, we introduce Adaptive Early Feature Selection (AEFS), a very simple method that not only adaptively selects informative features for each instance, but also significantly reduces the activated parameters of the embedding layer. AEFS employs a dual-model architecture, encompassing an auxiliary model dedicated to feature selection and a main model responsible for prediction. To ensure effective alignment between these two models, we incorporate two collaborative training loss constraints. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. Notably, AEFS matches the performance of current state-of-theart Adaptive Late Feature Selection methods while achieving a significant reduction of 37. 5% in the activated parameters of the embedding layer. AEFS is open-source at https://github. com/fly-dragon211/AEFS .</p></details> | Accepted by TKDE |
| **[Burger: Robust Graph Denoising-augmentation Fusion and Multi-semantic Modeling in Social Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06612v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of rapid development of social media, social recommendation systems as hybrid recommendation systems have been widely applied. Existing methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item interaction network for further improving social recommendation. To address these issues, we introduce a social \underline{r}ecommendation model with ro\underline{bu}st g\underline{r}aph denoisin\underline{g}-augmentation fusion and multi-s\underline{e}mantic Modeling(Burger). Specifically, we firstly propose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of the model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference, respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling, we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration. Extensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Federated Recommender System with Data Valuation for E-commerce Platform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11196v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) is gaining prominence in machine learning as privacy concerns grow. This paradigm allows each client (e.g., an individual online store) to train a recommendation model locally while sharing only model updates, without exposing the raw interaction logs to a central server, thereby preserving privacy in a decentralized environment. Nonetheless, most existing FL-based recommender systems still rely solely on each client's private data, despite the abundance of publicly available datasets that could be leveraged to enrich local training; this potential remains largely underexplored. To this end, we consider a realistic scenario wherein a large shopping platform collaborates with multiple small online stores to build a global recommender system. The platform possesses global data, such as shareable user and item lists, while each store holds a portion of interaction data privately (or locally). Although integrating global data can help mitigate the limitations of sparse and biased clients' local data, it also introduces additional challenges: simply combining all global interactions can amplify noise and irrelevant patterns, worsening personalization and increasing computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose FedGDVE, which selectively augments each client's local graph with semantically aligned samples from the global dataset. FedGDVE employs: (i) a pre-trained graph encoder to extract global structural features, (ii) a local valid predictor to assess client-specific relevance, (iii) a reinforcement-learning-based probability estimator to filter and sample only the most pertinent global interactions. FedGDVE improves performance by up to 34.86% on recognized benchmarks in FL environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Expert Systems with Applications Journal, Elsevier</p></details> |

To effectively address these issues, we propose a Query-toRecommendation, a parallel recommendation framework that decouples LLMs from candidate pre-selection and instead enables direct retrieval over the entire item pool. Our framework connects LLMs and recommendation models in a parallel manner, allowing each component to independently utilize its strengths without interfering with the other. In this framework, LLMs are utilized to generate feature-enriched item descriptions and personalized user queries, allowing for capturing diverse preferences and enabling rich semantic matching in a zero-shot manner. To effectively combine the complementary strengths of LLM and collaborative signals, we introduce an adaptive reranking strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate an improvement in performance up to 57%, while also improving the novelty and diversity of recommendations.</p></details> |  |

To address the lack of comprehensive assessment frameworks in prior research, we propose a multidimensional analysis that evaluates cocoons through dual perspectives: (1) Individual homogenization via topic diversity (including the number of topic categories and category information entropy) and click repetition; (2) Group polarization via network density and community openness. Through multi-round experiments on real-world datasets, we benchmark seven algorithms and reveal critical insights. Furthermore, we design five lightweight mitigation strategies. This work establishes the first unified metric framework for information cocoons and delivers deployable solutions for ethical recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |

However, concerns about user agency persist due to their inherent opacity (information asymmetry) and one-way influence (power asymmetry). This study introduces a provotype designed to enhance user agency by providing actionable transparency and control over data management and content delivery. We conducted qualitative interviews with 19 participants to explore their preferences and concerns regarding the features, as well as the provotype's impact on users' understanding and trust toward recommender systems. Findings underscore the importance of integrating transparency with control, and reaffirm users' desire for agency and the ability to actively intervene in personalization. We also discuss insights for encouraging adoption and awareness of such agency-enhancing features. Overall, this study contributes novel approaches and applicable insights, laying the groundwork for designing more user-centered recommender systems that foreground user autonomy and fairness in AI-driven content delivery.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |

Existing methods also often lack adaptive multi-source signal fusion tailored to item popularity. This paper introduces SPARK, a novel multi-stage framework systematically tackling these issues. SPARK first employs Tucker low-rank decomposition to denoise KGs and generate robust entity representations. Subsequently, an SVD-initialized hybrid geometric GNN concurrently learns representations in Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces; the latter is strategically leveraged for its aptitude in modeling hierarchical structures, effectively capturing semantic features of sparse, long-tail items. A core contribution is an item popularity-aware adaptive fusion strategy that dynamically weights signals from collaborative filtering, refined KG embeddings, and diverse geometric spaces for precise modeling of both mainstream and long-tail items. Finally, contrastive learning aligns these multi-source representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPARK's significant superiority over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in improving long-tail item recommendation, offering a robust, principled approach to knowledge-enhanced recommendation. Implementation code is available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/SPARK.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM' 25 |

However, recent studies have shown that RecSys are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether user interaction record was used to train a target model or not. MIAs on RecSys models can directly lead to a privacy breach. For example, via identifying the fact that a purchase record that has been used to train a RecSys associated with a specific user, an attacker can infer that user's special quirks. In recent years, MIAs have been shown to be effective on other ML tasks, e.g., classification models and natural language processing. However, traditional MIAs are ill-suited for RecSys due to the unseen posterior probability. Although MIAs on RecSys form a newly emerging and rapidly growing research area, there has been no systematic survey on this topic yet. In this article, we conduct the first comprehensive survey on RecSys MIAs. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in RecSys MIAs, exploring the design principles, challenges, attack and defense associated with this emerging field. We provide a unified taxonomy that categorizes different RecSys MIAs based on their characterizations and discuss their pros and cons. Based on the limitations and gaps identified in this survey, we point out several promising future research directions to inspire the researchers who wish to follow this area. This survey not only serves as a reference for the research community but also provides a clear description for researchers outside this research domain.</p></details> |  |

Such environments give agents a proper training space where they can learn from errors without impacting real users. RecoWorld distinguishes itself with a dual-view architecture: a simulated user and an agentic recommender engage in multi-turn interactions aimed at maximizing user retention. The user simulator reviews recommended items, updates its mindset, and when sensing potential user disengagement, generates reflective instructions. The agentic recommender adapts its recommendations by incorporating these user instructions and reasoning traces, creating a dynamic feedback loop that actively engages users. This process leverages the exceptional reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs. We explore diverse content representations within the simulator, including text-based, multimodal, and semantic ID modeling, and discuss how multi-turn RL enables the recommender to refine its strategies through iterative interactions. RecoWorld also supports multi-agent simulations, allowing creators to simulate the responses of targeted user populations. It marks an important first step toward recommender systems where users and agents collaboratively shape personalized information streams. We envision new interaction paradigms where "user instructs, recommender responds," jointly optimizing user retention and engagement.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately predicting key thermophysical properties remains challenging due to the vast chemical design space and the limited availability of experimental data. In this study, we present a data-driven transfer learning framework that leverages a neural recommender system (NRS) to enable reliable property prediction for ILs using sparse experimental datasets. The approach involves a two-stage process: first, pre-training NRS models on COSMO-RS-based simulated data at fixed temperature and pressure to learn property-specific structural embeddings for cations and anions; and second, fine-tuning simple feedforward neural networks using these embeddings with experimental data at varying temperatures and pressures. In this work, five essential IL properties are considered: density, viscosity, surface tension, heat capacity, and melting point. The framework supports both within-property and cross-property knowledge transfer. Notably, pre-trained models for density, viscosity, and heat capacity are used to fine-tune models for all five target properties, achieving improved performance by a substantial margin for four of them. The model exhibits robust extrapolation to previously unseen ILs. Moreover, the final trained models enable property prediction for over 700,000 IL combinations, offering a scalable solution for IL screening in process design. This work highlights the effectiveness of combining simulated data and transfer learning to overcome sparsity in the experimental data.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods frequently reduce the interpretability and transparency of the system. In this research, we develop a systematic application, adaptation, and evaluation of deletion diagnostics in the recommender setting. The method compares the performance of a model to that of a similar model trained without a specific user or item, allowing us to quantify how that observation influences the recommender, either positively or negatively. To demonstrate its model-agnostic nature, the proposal is applied to both Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), a widely used deep learning-based recommender, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a classical collaborative filtering technique. Experiments on the MovieLens and Amazon Reviews datasets provide insights into model behavior and highlight the generality of the approach across different recommendation paradigms.</p></details> |  |

While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt these models, studies often prioritize parameter efficiency, neglecting GPU memory and training speed. To address this, we introduced the IISAN framework, significantly enhancing efficiency. However, IISAN was limited to symmetrical MFMs and identical text and image encoders, preventing the use of state-of-the-art Large Language Models. To overcome this, we developed IISAN-Versa, a versatile plug-and-play architecture compatible with both symmetrical and asymmetrical MFMs. IISAN-Versa employs a Decoupled PEFT structure and utilizes both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. It effectively handles asymmetry through a simple yet effective combination of group layer-dropping and dimension transformation alignment. Our research demonstrates that IISAN-Versa effectively adapts large text encoders, and we further identify a scaling effect where larger encoders generally perform better. IISAN-Versa also demonstrates strong versatility in our defined multimodal scenarios, which include raw titles and captions generated from images and videos. Additionally, IISAN-Versa achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Microlens public benchmark. We release our code at https://github.com/GAIR-Lab/IISAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)</p></details> |

Despite its effectiveness, this study uncovers that LLM empowered recommender systems are vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose both system and user privacy. To examine this threat, we present the first systematic study on inversion attacks targeting LLM empowered recommender systems, where adversaries attempt to reconstruct original prompts that contain personal preferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes by exploiting the output logits of recommendation models. We reproduce the vec2text framework and optimize it using our proposed method called Similarity Guided Refinement, enabling more accurate reconstruction of textual prompts from model generated logits. Extensive experiments across two domains (movies and books) and two representative LLM based recommendation models demonstrate that our method achieves high fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we can recover nearly 65 percent of the user interacted items and correctly infer age and gender in 87 percent of the cases. The experiments also reveal that privacy leakage is largely insensitive to the victim model's performance but highly dependent on domain consistency and prompt complexity. These findings expose critical privacy vulnerabilities in LLM empowered recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM RecSys 2025 (10 pages, 4 figures)</p></details> |

In this study, we examine to what extent Twitter's content recommender, in conjunction with a user's social network, impacts the topic, political skew, and reliability of information served on the platform during a high-stakes election. We utilize automated accounts to document Twitter's algorithmically curated and reverse chronological timelines throughout the U.S. 2022 midterm election. We find that the algorithmic timeline measurably influences exposure to election content, partisan skew, and the prevalence of low-quality information and election rumors. Critically, these impacts are mediated by the partisan makeup of one's personal social network, which often exerts greater influence than the algorithm alone. We find that the algorithmic feed decreases the proportion of election content shown to left-leaning accounts, and that it skews content toward right-leaning sources when compared to the reverse chronological feed. We additionally find evidence that the algorithmic system increases the prevalence of election-related rumors for right-leaning accounts, and has mixed effects on the prevalence of low-quality information sources. Our work provides insight into the outcomes of Twitter's complex recommender system at a crucial time period before controversial changes to the platform and in the midst of nationwide elections and highlights the need for ongoing study of algorithmic systems and their role in democratic processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) 2026</p></details> |
| **[InterFormer: Effective Heterogeneous Interaction Learning for Click-Through Rate Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09852v4)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which predicts the probability of a user clicking an ad, is a fundamental task in recommender systems. The emergence of heterogeneous information, such as user profile and behavior sequences, depicts user interests from different aspects. A mutually beneficial integration of heterogeneous information is the cornerstone towards the success of CTR prediction. However, most of the existing methods suffer from two fundamental limitations, including (1) insufficient inter-mode interaction due to the unidirectional information flow between modes, and (2) aggressive information aggregation caused by early summarization, resulting in excessive information loss. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel module named InterFormer to learn heterogeneous information interaction in an interleaving style. To achieve better interaction learning, InterFormer enables bidirectional information flow for mutually beneficial learning across different modes. To avoid aggressive information aggregation, we retain complete information in each data mode and use a separate bridging arch for effective information selection and summarization. Our proposed InterFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[DeepVoting: Learning and Fine-Tuning Voting Rules with Canonical Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13630v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aggregating agent preferences into a collective decision is an important step in many problems (e.g., hiring, elections, peer review) and across areas of computer science (e.g., reinforcement learning, recommender systems). As Social Choice Theory has shown, the problem of designing aggregation rules with specific sets of properties (axioms) can be difficult, or provably impossible in some cases. Instead of designing algorithms by hand, one can learn aggregation rules, particularly voting rules, from data. However, prior work in this area has required extremely large models or been limited by the choice of preference representation, i.e., embedding. We recast the problem of designing voting rules with desirable properties into one of learning probabilistic functions that output distributions over a set of candidates. Specifically, we use neural networks to learn probabilistic social choice functions. Using standard embeddings from the social choice literature we show that preference profile encoding has significant impact on the efficiency and ability of neural networks to learn rules, allowing us to learn rules faster and with smaller networks than previous work. Moreover, we show that our learned rules can be fine-tuned using axiomatic properties to create novel voting rules and make them resistant to specific types of "attack". Namely, we fine-tune rules to resist a probabilistic version of the No Show Paradox.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Explainable Job Title Matching: Leveraging Semantic Textual Relatedness and Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09522v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions: low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and contextual matching are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stratified Expert Cloning for Retention-Aware Recommendation at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05628v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User retention is critical in large-scale recommender systems, significantly influencing online platforms' long-term success. Existing methods typically focus on short-term engagement, neglecting the evolving dynamics of user behaviors over time. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods, though promising for optimizing long-term rewards, face challenges like delayed credit assignment and sample inefficiency. We introduce Stratified Expert Cloning (SEC), an imitation learning framework that leverages abundant interaction data from high-retention users to learn robust policies. SEC incorporates: 1) multi-level expert stratification to model diverse retention behaviors; 2) adaptive expert selection to dynamically match users with appropriate policies based on their state and retention history; and 3) action entropy regularization to enhance recommendation diversity and policy generalization. Extensive offline evaluations and online A/B tests on major video platforms (Kuaishou and Kuaishou Lite) with hundreds of millions of users validate SEC's effectiveness. Results show substantial improvements, achieving cumulative lifts of 0.098 percent and 0.122 percent in active days on the two platforms respectively, each translating into over 200,000 additional daily active users.</p></details> | CIKM Accepted |

His critique, rooted in statistical misinterpretation and methodological shortcuts, remains as relevant today as it was then. But rather than correcting course, we added new layers of sophistication on top of the same broken foundations. This paper revisits Amatriain's diagnosis and argues that many of the conceptual, epistemological, and infrastructural failures he identified still persist, in more subtle or systemic forms. Drawing on recent work in reproducibility, evaluation methodology, environmental impact, and participatory design, we showcase how the field's accelerating complexity has outpaced its introspection. We highlight ongoing community-led initiatives that attempt to shift the paradigm, including workshops, evaluation frameworks, and calls for value-sensitive and participatory research. At the same time, we contend that meaningful change will require not only new metrics or better tooling, but a fundamental reframing of what recommender systems research is for, who it serves, and how knowledge is produced and validated. Our call is not just for technical reform, but for a recommender systems research agenda grounded in epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the work.

However, existing SRS methods often rely on collaborative filtering signals and fail to capture real-time user preferences, while Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS) excel at eliciting immediate interests through natural language interactions but neglect historical behavior. To bridge this gap, we propose CESRec, a novel framework that integrates the long-term preference modeling of SRS with the real-time preference elicitation of CRS. We introduce semantic-based pseudo interaction construction, which dynamically updates users'historical interaction sequences by analyzing conversational feedback, generating a pseudo-interaction sequence that seamlessly combines long-term and real-time preferences. Additionally, we reduce the impact of outliers in historical items that deviate from users'core preferences by proposing dual alignment outlier items masking, which identifies and masks such items using semantic-collaborative aligned representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CESRec achieves state-of-the-art performance by boosting strong SRS models, validating its effectiveness in integrating conversational feedback into SRS.</p></details> |  |

Transferring such technologies from academia to industry presents challenges related to trustworthiness, legacy systems, limited digital literacy, and the gap between academic and industrial expertise. For deep learning in particular, performance and integration into existing workflows are additional concerns. In this work, we first evaluate the performance of CodeBERT for detecting vulnerable functions in industrial and open-source software. We analyse its cross-domain generalisation when fine-tuned on open-source data and tested on industrial data, and vice versa, also exploring strategies for handling class imbalance. Based on these results, we develop AI-DO(Automating vulnerability detection Integration for Developers' Operations), a Continuous Integration-Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)-integrated recommender system that uses fine-tuned CodeBERT to detect and localise vulnerabilities during code review without disrupting workflows. Finally, we assess the tool's perceived usefulness through a survey with the company's IT professionals. Our results show that models trained on industrial data detect vulnerabilities accurately within the same domain but lose performance on open-source code, while a deep learner fine-tuned on open data, with appropriate undersampling techniques, improves the detection of vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 26th International Conference on Product-Focused Software Process Improvement (PROFES 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Constructing a Question-Answering Simulator through the Distillation of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09226v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students, thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation: (1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task and the knowledge tracing (KT) task.

Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional retrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic generation. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained by their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from two critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking a coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement (i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity. To overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that learns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core innovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization process that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more uniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict hierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for each recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE incorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space overlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but also promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive utilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled IDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks validate HiD-VAE's superior performance against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HiD-VAE-84B2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modality Alignment with Multi-scale Bilateral Attention for Multimodal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09114v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation systems are increasingly becoming foundational technologies for e-commerce and content platforms, enabling personalized services by jointly modeling users' historical behaviors and the multimodal features of items (e.g., visual and textual). However, most existing methods rely on either static fusion strategies or graph-based local interaction modeling, facing two critical limitations: (1) insufficient ability to model fine-grained cross-modal associations, leading to suboptimal fusion quality; and (2) a lack of global distribution-level consistency, causing representational bias. To address these, we propose MambaRec, a novel framework that integrates local feature alignment and global distribution regularization via attention-guided learning. At its core, we introduce the Dilated Refinement Attention Module (DREAM), which uses multi-scale dilated convolutions with channel-wise and spatial attention to align fine-grained semantic patterns between visual and textual modalities. This module captures hierarchical relationships and context-aware associations, improving cross-modal semantic modeling. Additionally, we apply Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and contrastive loss functions to constrain global modality alignment, enhancing semantic consistency. This dual regularization reduces mode-specific deviations and boosts robustness. To improve scalability, MambaRec employs a dimensionality reduction strategy to lower the computational cost of high-dimensional multimodal features. Extensive experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets show that MambaRec outperforms existing methods in fusion quality, generalization, and efficiency.

It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\ R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set, and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2, GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity. Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in LLM-based pipelines.</p></details> |  |

However, recommender systems can very well be used continuously for extended time. Similarly so, user behavior may evolve over that extended time. Although media studies and psychology offer a wealth of research on the evolution of user preferences and behavior as individuals age, there has been scant research in this regard within the realm of user modeling and recommender systems. In this study, we investigate the evolution of user preferences and behavior using the LFM-2b dataset, which, to our knowledge, is the only dataset that encompasses a sufficiently extensive time frame to permit real longitudinal studies and includes age information about its users. We identify specific usage and taste preferences directly related to the age of the user, i.e., while younger users tend to listen broadly to contemporary popular music, older users have more elaborate and personalized listening habits. The findings yield important insights that open new directions for research in recommender systems, providing guidance for future efforts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to UMAP 2025</p></details> |

While recent zero-shot methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to address this, they often struggle with sparse metadata and hallucinated or incomplete knowledge. We propose ColdRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation approach that builds a domain-specific knowledge graph dynamically to enhance LLM-based recommendation in cold-start scenarios, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. ColdRAG begins by converting structured item attributes into rich natural-language profiles, from which it extracts entities and relationships to construct a unified knowledge graph capturing item semantics. Given a user's interaction history, it scores edges in the graph using an LLM, retrieves candidate items with supporting evidence, and prompts the LLM to rank them. By enabling multi-hop reasoning over this graph, ColdRAG grounds recommendations in verifiable evidence, reducing hallucinations and strengthening semantic connections. Experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that ColdRAG surpasses existing zero-shot baselines in both Recall and NDCG. This framework offers a practical solution to cold-start recommendation by combining knowledge-graph reasoning with retrieval-augmented LLM generation.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of each possible rating.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |
| **[Generalized Tensor Completion with Non-Random Missingness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06225v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor completion plays a crucial role in applications such as recommender systems and medical imaging, where data are often highly incomplete. While extensive prior work has addressed tensor completion with data missingness, most assume that each entry of the tensor is available independently with probability $p$. However, real-world tensor data often exhibit missing-not-at-random (MNAR) patterns, where the probability of missingness depends on the underlying tensor values. This paper introduces a generalized tensor completion framework for noisy data with MNAR, where the observation probability is modeled as a function of underlying tensor values. Our flexible framework accommodates various tensor data types, such as continuous, binary and count data. For model estimation, we develop an alternating maximization algorithm and derive non-asymptotic error bounds for the estimator at each iteration, under considerably relaxed conditions on the observation probabilities. Additionally, we propose a statistical inference procedure to test whether observation probabilities depend on underlying tensor values, offering a formal assessment of the missingness assumption within our modeling framework. The utility and efficacy of our approach are demonstrated through comparative simulation studies and analyses of two real-world datasets.</p></details> | 31 pages |

To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer Type-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates consumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type theory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and expert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs. satisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction histories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user types in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate user types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that dynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query complexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like strategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book, and Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces interaction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that both consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance gains. These results demonstrate that CT-CRS offers a scalable and interpretable solution for enhancing CRS personalization through the integration of psychological modeling and advanced policy optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The tables Recommendation strategies for different consumer types need to be modified.

This limits their applicability in dynamic environments where user preferences evolve. Incremental learning offers a promising solution, yet conventional methods from computer vision or NLP face challenges in recommendation tasks due to data sparsity and distinct task paradigms. Existing approaches for neural recommenders remain limited and often lack generalizability. To address this, we propose MEGG, Replay Samples with Maximally Extreme GGscore, an experience replay based incremental learning framework. MEGG introduces GGscore, a novel metric that quantifies sample influence, enabling the selective replay of highly influential samples to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Being model-agnostic, MEGG integrates seamlessly across architectures and frameworks. Experiments on three neural models and four benchmark datasets show superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, with strong scalability, efficiency, and robustness.

To address this concern quantitatively, it is necessary to create datasets with relevant sensitivity labels for content, enabling researchers to evaluate personalized systems beyond mere engagement metrics. To this end, we introduce two novel datasets that include a taxonomy of sensitivity labels alongside user-content ratings: one that integrates MovieLens rating data with content warnings from the Does the Dog Die? community ratings website, and another that combines fan-fiction interaction data and user-generated warnings from Archive of Our Own.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compa...</summary><p>Companion Proceedings of the ACM on Web Conference 2025, 2025</p></details> |

Instead of retraining models or relying on opaque heuristics, our method restructures a user's Personalized Knowledge Graph (PKG) to suppress feature co-occurrence patterns that reinforce Personalized Information Environments (PIEs), i.e., algorithmically induced filter bubbles that constrain content diversity. These adapted PKGs are used to construct structured prompts that steer the language model toward more diverse, Out-PIE recommendations while preserving topical relevance. We introduce a family of symbolic adaptation strategies, including soft reweighting, hard inversion, and targeted removal of biased triples, and a client-side learning algorithm that optimizes their application per user. Experiments on a recipe recommendation benchmark show that personalized PKG adaptations significantly increase content novelty while maintaining recommendation quality, outperforming global adaptation and naive prompt-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, ISWC</p></details> |

Reducing content visibility, aka shadow banning, may help limit harmful content; however, it can also be used to suppress dissenting voices. This prompts the need for greater transparency and a better understanding of this practice. In this paper, we investigate the presence of visibility alterations through a large-scale quantitative analysis of two Twitter/X datasets comprising over 40 million tweets from more than 9 million users, focused on discussions surrounding the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the 2024 US Presidential Elections. We use view counts to detect patterns of reduced or inflated visibility and examine how these correlate with user opinions, social roles, and narrative framings. Our analysis shows that the algorithm systematically penalizes tweets containing links to external resources, reducing their visibility by up to a factor of eight, regardless of the ideological stance or source reliability. Rather, content visibility may be penalized or favored depending on the specific accounts producing it, as observed when comparing tweets from the Kyiv Independent and RT.com or tweets by Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Overall, our work highlights the importance of transparency in content moderation and recommendation systems to protect the integrity of public discourse and ensure equitable access to online platforms.</p></details> |  |

Thus, transparency and responsible adoption in Human Resource Management (HRM) are critical. This study examines how HR managers' AI literacy influences their subjective perception and objective understanding of explainable AI (XAI) elements in recruiting recommender dashboards. In an online experiment, 410 German-based HR managers compared baseline dashboards to versions enriched with three XAI styles: important features, counterfactuals, and model criteria. Our results show that the dashboards used in practice do not explain AI results and even keep AI elements opaque. However, while adding XAI features improves subjective perceptions of helpfulness and trust among users with moderate or high AI literacy, it does not increase their objective understanding. It may even reduce accurate understanding, especially with complex explanations. Only overlays of important features significantly aided the interpretations of high-literacy users. Our findings highlight that the benefits of XAI in recruitment depend on users' AI literacy, emphasizing the need for tailored explanation strategies and targeted literacy training in HRM to ensure fair, transparent, and effective adoption of AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper for RecSys in HR'25: The 5th Workshop on Recommender Systems for Human Resources, in conjunction with the 19th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, September 22--26, 2025, Prague, Czech Republic</p></details> |

This issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine, ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook Representations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for improved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings from app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns discrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel -- unlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables independent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better modeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative signals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item levels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a dual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to capture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a large-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong baselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps. Online A/B testing further validates our approach, showing a +10.52% lift in CTR and a +16.30% improvement in CVR, demonstrating PCR-CA's effectiveness in real-world deployment. The new framework has now been fully deployed on the Microsoft Store.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |

We address this challenge by modeling the breadth of user interest via the entropy of retrieval score distributions. Our method uses a neural retriever to fetch relevant items for a user query and computes the entropy of the re-ranked scores to dynamically route the dialogue policy: low-entropy (specific) queries trigger direct recommendations, whereas high-entropy (ambiguous) queries prompt exploratory questions. This simple yet effective strategy allows an LLM-driven agent to remain aware of an arbitrarily large catalog in real-time without bloating its context window.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformalized Tensor Completion with Riemannian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00581v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor data, or multi-dimensional arrays, is a data format popular in multiple fields such as social network analysis, recommender systems, and brain imaging. It is not uncommon to observe tensor data containing missing values, and tensor completion aims at estimating the missing values given the partially observed tensor. Sufficient efforts have been spared on devising scalable tensor completion algorithms, but few on quantifying the uncertainty of the estimator. In this paper, we nest the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of tensor completion under a split conformal prediction framework and establish the connection of the UQ problem to a problem of estimating the missing propensity of each tensor entry. We model the data missingness of the tensor with a tensor Ising model parameterized by a low-rank tensor parameter. We propose to estimate the tensor parameter by maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation (MPLE) with a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted to justify the validity of the resulting conformal interval. We apply our method to the regional total electron content (TEC) reconstruction problem. Supplemental materials of the paper are available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARIES: Relation Assessment and Model Recommendation for Deep Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06060v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning models for time series forecasting have been significant. These models often leverage fundamental time series properties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an intrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing benchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns, restricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there is no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost expenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream applications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing relation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for recommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we construct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a comprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct an extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the relationship between time series properties and modeling strategies. Our experimental results reveal a clear correlation. Based on these findings, we propose the first deep forecasting model recommender, capable of providing interpretable suggestions for real-world time series. In summary, ARIES is the first study to establish the relations between the properties of time series data and modeling strategies, while also implementing a model recommendation system. The code is available at: https://github.com/blisky-li/ARIES.</p></details> |  |

However, due to practical constraints, academic research remains largely confined to offline dataset optimizations, lacking access to real user data and large-scale recommendation platforms. This limitation reduces practical relevance, slows technological progress, and hampers a full understanding of the key challenges in recommender systems. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of industrial recommender systems and contrast them with their academic counterparts. We highlight key differences in data scale, real-time requirements, and evaluation methodologies, and we summarize major real-world recommendation scenarios along with their associated challenges. We then examine how industry practitioners address these challenges in Transaction-Oriented Recommender Systems and Content-Oriented Recommender Systems, a new classification grounded in item characteristics and recommendation objectives. Finally, we outline promising research directions, including the often-overlooked role of user decision-making, the integration of economic and psychological theories, and concrete suggestions for advancing academic research. Our goal is to enhance academia's understanding of practical recommender systems, bridge the growing development gap, and foster stronger collaboration between industry and academia.</p></details> | Working paper |
| **[RecPS: Privacy Risk Scoring for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18365v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RecSys) have become an essential component of many web applications. The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus, quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM RecSys 2025; to appear</p></details> |

| **[Linear Causal Representation Learning by Topological Ordering, Pruning, and Disentanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22553v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal representation learning (CRL) has garnered increasing interests from the causal inference and artificial intelligence community, due to its capability of disentangling potentially complex data-generating mechanism into causally interpretable latent features, by leveraging the heterogeneity of modern datasets. In this paper, we further contribute to the CRL literature, by focusing on the stylized linear structural causal model over the latent features and assuming a linear mixing function that maps latent features to the observed data or measurements. Existing linear CRL methods often rely on stringent assumptions, such as accessibility to single-node interventional data or restrictive distributional constraints on latent features and exogenous measurement noise. However, these prerequisites can be challenging to satisfy in certain scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel linear CRL algorithm that, unlike most existing linear CRL methods, operates under weaker assumptions about environment heterogeneity and data-generating distributions while still recovering latent causal features up to an equivalence class. We further validate our new algorithm via synthetic experiments and an interpretability analysis of large language models (LLMs), demonstrating both its superiority over competing methods in finite samples and its potential in integrating causality into AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning of Graph Representations for Network Intrusion Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16625v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting intrusions in network traffic is a challenging task, particularly under limited supervision and constantly evolving attack patterns. While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Category Discovery: An Open-World Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22542v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery, skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object scenarios. Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of the category discovery literature at https://github.com/Visual-AI/Category-Discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[We Think, Therefore We Align LLMs to Helpful, Harmless and Honest Before They Go Wrong](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22510v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) along multiple objectives-helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH)-is critical for safe and reliable deployment. Prior work has used steering vector-small control signals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via one-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single alignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for other objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches extend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While this alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize each objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs across HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch Steering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient multi-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the Transformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage II, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a policy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while maintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca, BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment across multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared to a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[PSTTS: A Plug-and-Play Token Selector for Efficient Event-based Spatio-temporal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22481v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba, and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements. Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3% on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning the Neighborhood: Contrast-Free Multimodal Self-Supervised Molecular Graph Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22468v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality molecular representations are essential for property prediction and molecular design, yet large labeled datasets remain scarce. While self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable 3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich 3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreqDebias: Towards Generalizable Deepfake Detection via Consistency-Driven Frequency Debiasing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22412v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup) augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization (CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs) and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Pre-Training Representations of Binary Code Using Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05102v5)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary code analysis and comprehension is critical to applications in reverse engineering and computer security tasks where source code is not available. Unfortunately, unlike source code, binary code lacks semantics and is more difficult for human engineers to understand and analyze. In this paper, we present ContraBin, a contrastive learning technique that integrates source code and comment information along with binaries to create an embedding capable of aiding binary analysis and comprehension tasks. Specifically, we present three components in ContraBin: (1) a primary contrastive learning method for initial pre-training, (2) a simplex interpolation method to integrate source code, comments, and binary code, and (3) an intermediate representation learning algorithm to train a binary code embedding. We further analyze the impact of human-written and synthetic comments on binary code comprehension tasks, revealing a significant performance disparity. While synthetic comments provide substantial benefits, human-written comments are found to introduce noise, even resulting in performance drops compared to using no comments. These findings reshape the narrative around the role of comment types in binary code analysis. We evaluate the effectiveness of ContraBin through four indicative downstream tasks related to binary code: algorithmic functionality classification, function name recovery, code summarization, and reverse engineering. The results show that ContraBin considerably improves performance on all four tasks, measured by accuracy, mean of average precision, and BLEU scores as appropriate. ContraBin is the first language representation model to incorporate source code, binary code, and comments into contrastive code representation learning and is intended to contribute to the field of binary code analysis. The dataset used in this study is available for further research.</p></details> |  |

However, a fundamental challenge, i.e., codebook collapse, remains underexplored in the graph domain, significantly limiting the expressiveness and generalization of graph tokens.In this paper, we present the first empirical study showing that codebook collapse consistently occurs when applying VQ to graph data, even with mitigation strategies proposed in vision or language domains. To understand why graph VQ is particularly vulnerable to collapse, we provide a theoretical analysis and identify two key factors: early assignment imbalances caused by redundancy in graph features and structural patterns, and self-reinforcing optimization loops in deterministic VQ. To address these issues, we propose RGVQ, a novel framework that integrates graph topology and feature similarity as explicit regularization signals to enhance codebook utilization and promote token diversity. RGVQ introduces soft assignments via Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization, ensuring that all codewords receive gradient updates. In addition, RGVQ incorporates a structure-aware contrastive regularization to penalize the token co-assignments among dissimilar node pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RGVQ substantially improves codebook utilization and consistently boosts the performance of state-of-the-art graph VQ backbones across multiple downstream tasks, enabling more expressive and transferable graph token representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pushing Toward the Simplex Vertices: A Simple Remedy for Code Collapse in Smoothed Vector Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22161v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector quantization, which discretizes a continuous vector space into a finite set of representative vectors (a codebook), has been widely adopted in modern machine learning. Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2) all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its $K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks, including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind the Missing: Variable-Aware Representation Learning for Irregular EHR Time Series using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22121v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often unavailable.</p></details> |  |
| **[CARL: Camera-Agnostic Representation Learning for Spectral Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19223v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains, including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce CARL, a model for Camera-Agnostic Representation Learning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic representation, we introduce a novel spectral encoder, featuring a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism, to distill salient spectral information into learned spectral representations. Spatio-spectral pre-training is achieved with a novel feature-based self-supervision strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[BrainPro: Towards Large-scale Brain State-aware EEG Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22050v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain electrical activity, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) and healthcare. Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others, current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and hardware settings. Pre-trained on an extensive EEG corpus, BrainPro achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI datasets. Our codes and the pre-trained weights will be released.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |

However, manual inspection of EEG characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error. Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively developed, they continue to face challenges arising from the non-stationarity and variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals across diverse clinical configurations, often resulting in poor generalization. In this work, we propose SleepDIFFormer, a multi-channel differential transformer framework for heterogeneous EEG-EOG representation learning. SleepDIFFormer is trained across multiple sleep staging datasets, each treated as a source domain, with the goal of generalizing to unseen target domains. Specifically, it employs a Multi-channel Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) designed to process raw EEG and EOG signals while incorporating cross-domain alignment. Our approach mitigates spatial and temporal attention noise and learns a domain-invariant EEG-EOG representation through feature distribution alignment across datasets, thereby enhancing generalization to new domains. Empirically, we evaluated SleepDIFFormer on five diverse sleep staging datasets under domain generalization settings and benchmarked it against existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We further conducted a comprehensive ablation study and interpreted the differential attention weights, demonstrating their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns. These findings advance the development of automated sleep stage classification and highlight its potential in quantifying sleep architecture and detecting abnormalities that disrupt restorative rest.

While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements, when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.</p></details> |  |

To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects, recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data. Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets, providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://czvvd.github.io/PartSAMPage/</p></details> |

In this work, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a series of versatile and compact embedding models, systematically incentivizing advanced embedding capability in LLMs by superior training techniques and high-quality data. For model architecture, we implement the models on a 0.5B compact size with simple mean-pooling to produce fixed-length embeddings and remove the causal attention mask to enable fully bidirectional representation learning. For training techniques, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline: pre-training on weakly supervised large-scale datasets, fine-tuning with supervised high-quality datasets, and contrastive distillation with fine-grained soft signals, integrated with focal-style reweighting and online hard-negative mixing to emphasize difficult samples and enrich hard negatives, respectively. For training data, we curate over 20 categories for pre-training and 100 categories for fine-tuning and contrastive distillation, to improve both performance and generalization, leveraging task-specific instructions, hard-negative mining, and example-based multi-class labeling to ensure high quality. Combining these techniques, our KaLM-Embedding-V2 series achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark, outperforming models of comparable size and rivaling models 3-26x larger, setting a new standard for versatile and compact embedding models under 1B parameters. The code, data, and models will be publicly available to facilitate academic research.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 16 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[TRACE: Learning to Compute on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21886v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts, prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective. First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce \textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Value of Cross-Modal Misalignment in Multimodal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10143v7)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal representation learning, exemplified by multimodal contrastive learning (MMCL) using image-text pairs, aims to learn powerful representations by aligning cues across modalities. This approach relies on the core assumption that the exemplar image-text pairs constitute two representations of an identical concept. However, recent research has revealed that real-world datasets often exhibit cross-modal misalignment. There are two distinct viewpoints on how to address this issue: one suggests mitigating the misalignment, and the other leveraging it. We seek here to reconcile these seemingly opposing perspectives, and to provide a practical guide for practitioners. Using latent variable models we thus formalize cross-modal misalignment by introducing two specific mechanisms: Selection bias, where some semantic variables are absent in the text, and perturbation bias, where semantic variables are altered -- both leading to misalignment in data pairs. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the representations learned by MMCL capture exactly the information related to the subset of the semantic variables invariant to selection and perturbation biases. This provides a unified perspective for understanding misalignment. Based on this, we further offer actionable insights into how misalignment should inform the design of real-world ML systems. We validate our theoretical findings via extensive empirical studies on both synthetic data and real image-text datasets, shedding light on the nuanced impact of cross-modal misalignment on multimodal representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 camera-ready version (with checklist removed for presentation clarity)</p></details> |

Within this context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-Augmented Contrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models and supervised contrastive learning. The DACL framework operates on a latent space created by a lightweight Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on our novel Scattering Transformer (ST) features [12]. It utilizes the diffusion forward process as a principled data augmentation technique to generate multiple noisy views of these latent embeddings. A U-Net style encoder is then trained with a supervised contrastive objective to learn a representation that balances class discrimination with robustness to noise across various diffusion time steps. We evaluated this proof-of-concept method on the PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset, achieving a competitive AUROC of 0.7815. This work establishes a new paradigm for representation learning by using the diffusion process itself to drive the contrastive objective, creating noise-invariant embeddings that demonstrate a strong foundation for class separability.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPAR: Self-supervised Placement-Aware Representation Learning for Distributed Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16936v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SPAR, a framework for self-supervised placement-aware representation learning in distributed sensing. Distributed sensing spans applications where multiple spatially distributed and multimodal sensors jointly observe an environment, from vehicle monitoring to human activity recognition and earthquake localization. A central challenge shared by this wide spectrum of applications, is that observed signals are inseparably shaped by sensor placements, including their spatial locations and structural roles. However, existing pretraining methods remain largely placement-agnostic. SPAR addresses this gap through a unifying principle: the duality between signals and positions. Guided by this principle, SPAR introduces spatial and structural positional embeddings together with dual reconstruction objectives, explicitly modeling how observing positions and observed signals shape each other. Placement is thus treated not as auxiliary metadata but as intrinsic to representation learning. SPAR is theoretically supported by analyses from information theory and occlusion-invariant learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SPAR achieves superior robustness and generalization across various modalities, placements, and downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[IndiSeek learns information-guided disentangled representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21584v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning disentangled representations is a fundamental task in multi-modal learning. In modern applications such as single-cell multi-omics, both shared and modality-specific features are critical for characterizing cell states and supporting downstream analyses. Ideally, modality-specific features should be independent of shared ones while also capturing all complementary information within each modality. This tradeoff is naturally expressed through information-theoretic criteria, but mutual-information-based objectives are difficult to estimate reliably, and their variational surrogates often underperform in practice. In this paper, we introduce IndiSeek, a novel disentangled representation learning approach that addresses this challenge by combining an independence-enforcing objective with a computationally efficient reconstruction loss that bounds conditional mutual information. This formulation explicitly balances independence and completeness, enabling principled extraction of modality-specific features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IndiSeek on synthetic simulations, a CITE-seq dataset and multiple real-world multi-modal benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Mutual Information Learning: Toward Robust Representations without Positive-Pair Augmentations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21511v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning representations that transfer well to diverse downstream tasks remains a central challenge in representation learning. Existing paradigms -- contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders -- balance this challenge with different trade-offs. We introduce the {contrastive Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a contrastive objective. While MIM maximizes mutual information between inputs and latents and promotes clustering of codes, it falls short on discriminative tasks. cMIM addresses this gap by imposing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative fidelity. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose cMIM, a contrastive extension of MIM that removes the need for positive data augmentation and is substantially less sensitive to batch size than InfoNCE. Second, we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for extracting enriched features from encoder-decoder models that boosts discriminative performance without additional training and applies broadly beyond MIM. Third, we provide empirical evidence across vision and molecular benchmarks showing that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on classification and regression tasks while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. These results position cMIM as a unified framework for representation learning, advancing the goal of models that serve both discriminative and generative applications effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 9 pages main manuscript, 23 pages with appendix</p></details> |
| **[Structured Relational Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12143v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Invariant representations are core to representation learning, yet a central challenge remains: uncovering invariants that are stable and transferable without suppressing task-relevant signals. This raises fundamental questions, requiring further inquiry, about the appropriate level of abstraction at which such invariants should be defined and which aspects of a system they should characterize. Interpretation of the environment relies on abstract knowledge structures to make sense of the current state, which leads to interactions, essential drivers of learning and knowledge acquisition. Interpretation operates at the level of higher-order relational knowledge; hence, we propose that invariant structures must be where knowledge resides, specifically as partitions defined by the closure of relational paths within an abstract knowledge space. These partitions serve as the core invariant representations, forming the structural substrate where knowledge is stored and learning occurs. On the other hand, inter-partition connectors enable the deployment of these knowledge partitions encoding task-relevant transitions. Thus, invariant partitions provide the foundational primitives of structured representation. We formalize the computational foundations for structured relational representations of the invariant partitions based on closed semiring, a relational algebraic structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning for Gene Regulatory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17786v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a powerful self-supervised learning framework that performs data augmentation through graph perturbations, with growing applications in the analysis of biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). The artificial perturbations commonly used in GCL, such as node dropping, induce structural changes that can diverge from biological reality. This concern has contributed to a broader trend in graph representation learning toward augmentation-free methods, which view such structural changes as problematic and to be avoided. However, this trend overlooks the fundamental insight that structural changes from biologically meaningful perturbations are not a problem to be avoided but a rich source of information, thereby ignoring the valuable opportunity to leverage data from real biological experiments. Motivated by this insight, we propose SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a new GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations from gene knockdown experiments as supervision. SupGCL is a probabilistic formulation that continuously generalizes conventional GCL, linking artificial augmentations with real perturbations measured in knockdown experiments and using the latter as explicit supervisory signals. To assess effectiveness, we train GRN representations with SupGCL and evaluate their performance on downstream tasks. The evaluation includes both node-level tasks, such as gene function classification, and graph-level tasks on patient-specific GRNs, such as patient survival hazard prediction. Across 13 tasks built from GRN datasets derived from patients with three cancer types, SupGCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | under review |
| **[SlideMamba: Entropy-Based Adaptive Fusion of GNN and Mamba for Enhanced Representation Learning in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21239v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied Representation Alignment with Mirror Neurons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21136v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected. Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay, treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align. Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space, where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[UniTransfer: Video Concept Transfer via Progressive Spatial and Timestep Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21086v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual fidelity and editability.

| **[Alignment Unlocks Complementarity: A Framework for Multiview Circuit Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20968v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich, complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow Matching in the Low-Noise Regime: Pathologies and a Contrastive Remedy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20952v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero, arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions, thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology, establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF), a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation learning.</p></details> |  |

Changes in input data distributions caused by sensor drift or lighting variations necessitate continual model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid training methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by combining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method begins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to achieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed for online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to shifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness of Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational efficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic accelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a reduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining model performance in dynamic environments.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

Previous research found that poor representations and biased classifiers are the main problems and proposed neural-collapse-inspired synthetic simplex ETF to help representations be closer to neural collapse optima. However, we find that the neural-collapse-inspired methods are not strong enough to reach neural collapse and still have huge gaps to centralized training. In this paper, we rethink this issue from a self-bootstrap perspective and propose FedYoYo (You Are Your Own Best Teacher), introducing Augmented Self-bootstrap Distillation (ASD) to improve representation learning by distilling knowledge between weakly and strongly augmented local samples, without needing extra datasets or models. We further introduce Distribution-aware Logit Adjustment (DLA) to balance the self-bootstrap process and correct biased feature representations. FedYoYo nearly eliminates the performance gap, achieving centralized-level performance even under mixed heterogeneity. It enhances local representation learning, reducing model drift and improving convergence, with feature prototypes closer to neural collapse optimality. Extensive experiments show FedYoYo achieves state-of-the-art results, even surpassing centralized logit adjustment methods by 5.4\% under global long-tailed settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniHR: Hierarchical Representation Learning for Unified Knowledge Graph Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07019v5)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world knowledge graphs (KGs) contain not only standard triple-based facts, but also more complex, heterogeneous types of facts, such as hyper-relational facts with auxiliary key-value pairs, temporal facts with additional timestamps, and nested facts that imply relationships between facts. These richer forms of representation have attracted significant attention due to their enhanced expressiveness and capacity to model complex semantics in real-world scenarios. However, most existing studies suffer from two main limitations: (1) they typically focus on modeling only specific types of facts, thus making it difficult to generalize to real-world scenarios with multiple fact types; and (2) they struggle to achieve generalizable hierarchical (inter-fact and intra-fact) modeling due to the complexity of these representations. To overcome these limitations, we propose UniHR, a Unified Hierarchical Representation learning framework, which consists of a learning-optimized Hierarchical Data Representation (HiDR) module and a unified Hierarchical Structure Learning (HiSL) module. The HiDR module unifies hyper-relational KGs, temporal KGs, and nested factual KGs into triple-based representations. Then HiSL incorporates intra-fact and inter-fact message passing, focusing on enhancing both semantic information within individual facts and enriching the structural information between facts. To go beyond the unified method itself, we further explore the potential of unified representation in complex real-world scenarios, including joint modeling of multi-task, compositional and hybrid facts. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets across 5 types of KGs demonstrate the effectiveness of UniHR and highlight the strong potential of unified representations.</p></details> |  |

From inverse problems to numerical PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and (iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 22 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot, cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings. Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and 73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in low-resource contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Conference on Big Data 2025</p></details> |

Graph SSL is particularly useful in scenarios with limited or no labeled data. Existing SSL methods predominantly follow contrastive or generative paradigms, each excelling in different tasks: contrastive methods typically perform well on classification tasks, while generative methods often excel in link prediction. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for graph SSL that integrates the strengths of both approaches. Our framework introduces community-aware node-level contrastive learning, providing more robust and effective positive and negative node pairs generation, alongside graph-level contrastive learning to capture global semantic information. Additionally, we employ a comprehensive augmentation strategy that combines feature masking, node perturbation, and edge perturbation, enabling robust and diverse representation learning. By incorporating these enhancements, our model achieves superior performance across multiple tasks, including node classification, clustering, and link prediction. Evaluations on open benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a performance lift of 0.23%-2.01% depending on the task and dataset.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Beyond Visual Similarity: Rule-Guided Multimodal Clustering with explicit domain rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20501v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models, highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for complex, knowledge intensive settings.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Offline Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Quasimetric Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20478v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn "successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric) distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a **quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments. This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on quasimetric networks struggle.</p></details> |  |
| **[FORGE: Foundational Optimization Representations from Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20330v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Still, learning-based approaches to accelerate combinatorial optimization often require solving a large number of difficult instances to collect training data, incurring significant computational cost. Existing learning-based methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution, for each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization. We introduce Forge: Foundational Optimization Representations from Graph Embeddings, a framework that pre-trains a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on a large, diverse collection of mixed-integer programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised manner, without relying on optimization solvers or optimal solutions. Vector quantization produces discrete code assignments that serve as a vocabulary for representing optimization instances. We evaluate Forge in both unsupervised and supervised settings. In the unsupervised setting, Forge embeddings effectively cluster unseen instances across problem domains and sizes. In the supervised setting, we fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single pre-trained model helps predicting both the integrality gap for cut-generation and variable hints for search guidance across multiple problem and size distributions. In both tasks, we improve the performance of a commercial optimization solver and outperform state-of-the-art learning-based methods. Finally, we open-source our training code, pre-trained Forge weights, and embeddings for multiple MIP distributions to foster further research in representation learning for optimization problems.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of seven discriminative self-supervised models and one supervised model across diverse tasks, including ImageNet classification, transfer learning, segmentation, and detection. Our findings suggest that discriminative SSL models generally exhibit better robustness to adversarial attacks compared to their supervised counterpart on ImageNet, with this advantage extending to transfer learning when using linear evaluation. However, when fine-tuning is applied, the robustness gap between SSL and supervised models narrows considerably. Similarly, this robustness advantage diminishes in segmentation and detection tasks. We also investigate how various factors might influence adversarial robustness, including architectural choices, training duration, data augmentations, and batch sizes. Our analysis contributes to the ongoing exploration of adversarial robustness in visual self-supervised representation systems.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

However, data collected from a realistic scene usually has a non-Euclidean structure, evaluating the consistency of latent representations from paired views using Euclidean distance raises challenges. To address this issue, a novel SPD (symmetric positive definite) manifold learning is proposed for multi-modal image fusion, named SMLNet, which extends the image fusion approach from the Euclidean space to the SPD manifolds. Specifically, we encode images according to the Riemannian geometry to exploit their intrinsic statistical correlations, thereby aligning with human visual perception. The SPD matrix fundamentally underpins our network's learning process. Building upon this mathematical foundation, we employ a cross-modal fusion strategy to exploit modality-specific dependencies and augment complementary information. To capture semantic similarity in images' intrinsic space, we further develop an attention module that meticulously processes the cross-modal semantic affinity matrix. Based on this, we design an end-to-end fusion network based on cross-modal manifold learning. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our framework exhibits superior performance compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Shaoyun2023.</p></details> | 23 pages, 17 figures |

How to integrate multi-modality features into federated recommendation is still an open challenge in terms of efficiency, distribution heterogeneity, and fine-grained alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal fusion mechanism in federated recommendation settings (GFMFR). Specifically, it offloads multimodal representation learning to the server, which stores item content and employs a high-capacity encoder to generate expressive representations, alleviating client-side overhead. Moreover, a group-aware item representation fusion approach enables fine-grained knowledge sharing among similar users while retaining individual preferences. The proposed fusion loss could be simply plugged into any existing federated recommender systems empowering their capability by adding multi-modality features. Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that GFMFR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal FR baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, extracting biologically meaningful and batch-robust cell painting representations remains challenging. Conventional self-supervised and contrastive learning approaches often require a large-scale model and/or a huge amount of carefully curated data, still struggling with batch effects. We present Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN), a novel representation learning framework that aligns embeddings of cells subjected to the same perturbation across different wells, enforcing semantic consistency despite batch effects. Integrated into a masked siamese architecture, this alignment yields features that capture fine-grained morphology while remaining data- and parameter-efficient. For instance, in a gene-gene relationship retrieval benchmark, CWA-MSN outperforms the state-of-the-art publicly available self-supervised (OpenPhenom) and contrastive learning (CellCLIP) methods, improving the benchmark scores by +29\% and +9\%, respectively, while training on substantially fewer data (e.g., 0.2M images for CWA-MSN vs. 2.2M images for OpenPhenom) or smaller model size (e.g., 22M parameters for CWA-MSN vs. 1.48B parameters for CellCLIP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that CWA-MSN is a simple and effective way to learn cell image representation, enabling efficient phenotype modeling even under limited data and parameter budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, reference 4 pages</p></details> |

Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels. Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue, such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper, we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii) maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or domain labels during representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

A Case Study with In-Context Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17552v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be enhanced with test-time computation, which relies on external tools and even other deep learning models. However, existing approaches for integrating non-text modality representations into LLMs typically require additional costly supervised training, restricting on-the-fly adaptation to new domains and modalities. In this work, we explore the feasibility of integrating representations from non-text foundational models (FMs) into text-based LLMs in a training-free manner. We propose In-Context Representation Learning (ICRL) as a proof-of-concept to allow LLMs to adaptively utilize non-text modality representations with few-shot learning. Unlike traditional in-context learning, which incorporates text-label pairs, ICRL replaces text inputs with FM representations, enabling the LLM to perform multi-modal inference without fine-tuning. We evaluate ICRL on a suite of tasks in the molecular domain, investigating three core research questions: (i) how to map FM representations into LLMs in a training-free manner, (ii) what factors influence ICRL performance, and (iii) what mechanisms underlie the effectiveness of ICRL. To the best of our knowledge, ICRL is the first training-free framework for integrating non-text modality representations into text-based LLMs, presenting a promising direction for adaptable, multi-modal generalization.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Reconstruction quality can be improved by incorporating additional penalties such as adversarial (GAN) and perceptual losses. Arguably, these approaches lack a principled interpretation. Concurrently, in generative settings diffusion has demonstrated a remarkable ability to create crisp, high quality results and has solid theoretical underpinnings (from variational inference to direct study as the Fisher Divergence). Our work combines autoencoder representation learning with diffusion and is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate jointly learning a continuous encoder and decoder under a diffusion-based loss and showing that it can lead to higher compression and better generation. We demonstrate that this approach yields better reconstruction quality as compared to GAN-based autoencoders while being easier to tune. We also show that the resulting representation is easier to model with a latent diffusion model as compared to the representation obtained from a state-of-the-art GAN-based loss. Since our decoder is stochastic, it can generate details not encoded in the otherwise deterministic latent representation; we therefore name our approach "Sample what you can't compress", or SWYCC for short.</p></details> |  |

We argue that using positional encoding in point Transformer-based methods serves to aggregate multi-scale features of point clouds. Additionally, we explore parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) through the lens of prompts and adapters, introducing a straightforward yet effective method called PPT for point cloud analysis. PPT incorporates increased patch tokens and trainable positional encoding while keeping most pre-trained model parameters frozen. Extensive experiments validate that PPT is both effective and efficient. Our proposed method of PEFT tasks, namely PPT, with only 1.05M of parameters for training, gets state-of-the-art results in several mainstream datasets, such as 95.01% accuracy in the ScanObjectNN OBJ_BG dataset.

Recently, deep learning-based hashing methods have proven effective for indexing time series based on semantic meaning rather than just raw similarity. The purpose of deep hashing is to map samples with the same semantic meaning to identical binary hash codes, enabling more efficient search and retrieval. Unlike other supervised representation learning methods, supervised deep hashing requires a discretization step to convert real-valued representations into binary codes, but this can induce significant information loss. In this paper, we propose a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss. The proposed deep hashing model maps data to an M-dimensional hyperspherical space to effectively reduce information loss and models each data class as points following distinct vMF distributions. The designed loss aims to maximize the separation between each modeled vMF distribution to provide a better way to maximize the margin between each semantically different data sample. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing baselines. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/jmpq97/vmf-hashing</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, Conference: ICMLA 2025</p></details> |

To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door", "approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper", etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://bpiyush.github.io/lift-website/</p></details> |
| **[Causality-Induced Positional Encoding for Transformer-Based Representation Learning of Non-Sequential Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16629v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positional encoding is essential for supplementing transformer with positional information of tokens. Existing positional encoding methods demand predefined token/feature order, rendering them unsuitable for real-world data with non-sequential yet causally-related features. To address this limitation, we propose CAPE, a novel method that identifies underlying causal structure over non-sequential features as a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) using generalized structural equation modeling. The DAG is then embedded in hyperbolic space where its geometric structure is well-preserved using a hyperboloid model-based approach that effectively captures two important causal graph properties (causal strength & causal specificity). This step yields causality-aware positional encodings for the features, which are converted into their rotary form for integrating with transformer's self-attention mechanism. Theoretical analysis reveals that CAPE-generated rotary positional encodings possess three valuable properties for enhanced self-attention, including causal distance-induced attenuation, causal generality-induced attenuation, and robustness to positional disturbances. We evaluate CAPE over both synthetic and real-word datasets, empirically demonstrating its theoretical properties and effectiveness in enhancing transformer for data with non-sequential features.

In a multi-scale framework, unresolved (subgrid) meso-scale dynamics is upscaled to the homogenized (macro-scale) representation of the heterogeneous material through closure models. Deep learning models trained using meso-scale simulation data are now a popular route to assimilate such closure laws. However, meso-scale simulations are computationally taxing, posing practical challenges in training deep learning-based surrogate models from scratch. In this work, we investigate an alternative meta-learning approach motivated by the idea of tokenization in natural language processing. We show that one can learn a reduced representation of the micro-scale physics to accelerate the meso-scale learning process by tokenizing the meso-scale evolution of the physical fields involved in an archetypal, albeit complex, reactive dynamics problem, \textit{viz.}, shock-induced energy localization in a porous energetic material. A probabilistic latent representation of \textit{micro}-scale dynamics is learned as building blocks for \textit{meso}-scale dynamics. The \textit{meso-}scale latent dynamics model learns the correlation between neighboring building blocks by training over a small dataset of meso-scale simulations. We compare the performance of our model with a physics-aware recurrent convolutional neural network (PARC) trained only on the full meso-scale dataset. We demonstrate that our model can outperform PARC with scarce meso-scale data. The proposed approach accelerates the development of closure models by leveraging inexpensive micro-scale simulations and fast training over a small meso-scale dataset, and can be applied to a range of multi-scale modeling problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 19 figures, complementary results added, restructured Introduction section</p></details> |

To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning. Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.</p></details> | Submitted to TPAMI |

Needing assumptions on latent structures or relationships to achieve identifiability in general, prior works often build upon conditional independence given known auxiliary variables. However, prior frameworks limit the scope of auxiliary variables to be external to the mixing function. Yet, in some cases, system-driving latent factors can be easily observed or extracted from data, possibly facilitating identification. In this paper, we introduce a framework of observable sources being auxiliaries, serving as effective conditioning variables. Our main results show that one can identify entire latent variables up to subspace-wise transformations and permutations using volume-preserving encoders. Moreover, when multiple known auxiliary variables are available, we offer a variable-selection scheme to choose those that maximize recoverability of the latent factors given knowledge of the latent causal graph. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on synthetic graph and image data, thereby extending the boundaries of current approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, current deep learning models use new principles for unsupervised representation learning that cannot be easily analyzed using classical theories. For example, visual foundation models have found tremendous success using self-supervision or denoising/masked autoencoders, which effectively learn representations from massive amounts of unlabeled data. However, it remains difficult to characterize the representations learned by these models and to explain why they perform well for diverse prediction tasks or show emergent behavior. To answer these questions, one needs to combine mathematical tools from statistics and optimization. This paper provides an overview of recent theoretical advances in representation learning from unlabeled data and mentions our contributions in this direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Metallic Surface Defect Detection via Anomaly-Guided Pretraining on a Large Industrial Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18919v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pretraining-finetuning paradigm is a crucial strategy in metallic surface defect detection for mitigating the challenges posed by data scarcity. However, its implementation presents a critical dilemma. Pretraining on natural image datasets such as ImageNet, faces a significant domain gap. Meanwhile, naive self-supervised pretraining on in-domain industrial data is often ineffective due to the inability of existing learning objectives to distinguish subtle defect patterns from complex background noise and textures. To resolve this, we introduce Anomaly-Guided Self-Supervised Pretraining (AGSSP), a novel paradigm that explicitly guides representation learning through anomaly priors. AGSSP employs a two-stage framework: (1) it first pretrains the model's backbone by distilling knowledge from anomaly maps, encouraging the network to capture defect-salient features; (2) it then pretrains the detector using pseudo-defect boxes derived from these maps, aligning it with localization tasks. To enable this, we develop a knowledge-enhanced method to generate high-quality anomaly maps and collect a large-scale industrial dataset of 120,000 images. Additionally, we present two small-scale, pixel-level labeled metallic surface defect datasets for validation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSSP consistently enhances performance across various settings, achieving up to a 10\% improvement in mAP@0.5 and 11.4\% in mAP@0.5:0.95 compared to ImageNet-based models. All code, pretrained models, and datasets are publicly available at https://clovermini.github.io/AGSSP-Dev/.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViG-LRGC: Vision Graph Neural Networks with Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18840v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision. Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers. Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark dataset.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, existing SSL methods often rely on complex architectures, anatomy-specific priors, or heavily tuned augmentations, which limit their scalability and generalizability. More critically, these models are prone to shortcut learning, especially in modalities like chest X-rays, where anatomical similarity is high and pathology is subtle. In this work, we introduce DiSSECT -- Discrete Self-Supervision for Efficient Clinical Transferable Representations, a framework that integrates multi-scale vector quantization into the SSL pipeline to impose a discrete representational bottleneck. This constrains the model to learn repeatable, structure-aware features while suppressing view-specific or low-utility patterns, improving representation transfer across tasks and domains. DiSSECT achieves strong performance on both classification and segmentation tasks, requiring minimal or no fine-tuning, and shows particularly high label efficiency in low-label regimes. We validate DiSSECT across multiple public medical imaging datasets, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Autoencoders offer a natural framework for denoising and reconstruction, but their performance degrades under challenging real-world conditions. In this work, we propose TriFusion-AE, a multimodal cross-attention autoencoder that integrates textual priors, monocular depth maps from multi-view images, and LiDAR point clouds to improve robustness. By aligning semantic cues from text, geometric (depth) features from images, and spatial structure from LiDAR, TriFusion-AE learns representations that are resilient to stochastic noise and adversarial perturbations. Interestingly, while showing limited gains under mild perturbations, our model achieves significantly more robust reconstruction under strong adversarial attacks and heavy noise, where CNN-based autoencoders collapse. We evaluate on the nuScenes-mini dataset to reflect realistic low-data deployment scenarios. Our multimodal fusion framework is designed to be model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with any CNN-based point cloud autoencoder for joint representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop</p></details> |

Attribute Prompt Composition for Object Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18715v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to recognize individuals across non-overlapping camera views. While recent advances have achieved remarkable progress, most existing models are constrained to either single-domain or cross-domain scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. Single-domain models tend to overfit to domain-specific features, whereas cross-domain models often rely on diverse normalization strategies that may inadvertently suppress identity-specific discriminative cues. To address these limitations, we propose an Attribute Prompt Composition (APC) framework, which exploits textual semantics to jointly enhance discrimination and generalization. Specifically, we design an Attribute Prompt Generator (APG) consisting of a Semantic Attribute Dictionary (SAD) and a Prompt Composition Module (PCM). SAD is an over-complete attribute dictionary to provide rich semantic descriptions, while PCM adaptively composes relevant attributes from SAD to generate discriminative attribute-aware features. In addition, motivated by the strong generalization ability of Vision-Language Models (VLM), we propose a Fast-Slow Training Strategy (FSTS) to balance ReID-specific discrimination and generalizable representation learning. Specifically, FSTS adopts a Fast Update Stream (FUS) to rapidly acquire ReID-specific discriminative knowledge and a Slow Update Stream (SUS) to retain the generalizable knowledge inherited from the pre-trained VLM. Through a mutual interaction, the framework effectively focuses on ReID-relevant features while mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on both conventional and Domain Generalized (DG) ReID datasets demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting superior performances in terms of both discrimination and generalization.

While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

One such self-supervised learning approach is masked spectrogram modeling, where the objective is to learn semantically rich contextual representations by predicting removed or hidden portions of the input audio spectrogram. With the Transformer neural architecture at its core, masked spectrogram modeling has emerged as the prominent approach for learning general purpose audio representations, a.k.a. audio foundation models. Meanwhile, addressing the issues of the Transformer architecture, in particular the underlying Scaled Dot-product Attention operation, which scales quadratically with input sequence length, has led to renewed interest in recurrent sequence modeling approaches. Among them, Selective structured state space models (such as Mamba) and extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) are the two most promising approaches which have experienced widespread adoption. While the body of work on these two topics continues to grow, there is currently a lack of an adequate overview encompassing the intersection of these topics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the aforementioned research domains, covering masked spectrogram modeling and the previously mentioned neural sequence modeling architectures, Mamba and xLSTM. Further, we compare Transformers, Mamba and xLSTM based masked spectrogram models in a unified, reproducible framework on ten diverse downstream audio classification tasks, which will help interested readers to make informed decisions regarding suitability of the evaluated approaches to adjacent applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to produce structure-aware and task-discriminative representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures.

However, its application to personalized sticker retrieval remains largely unexplored and presents unique challenges: existing relevance-based generative retrieval methods typically lack personalization, leading to a mismatch between diverse user expectations and the retrieved results. To address this gap, we propose PEARL, a novel generative framework for personalized sticker retrieval, and make two key contributions: (i) To encode user-specific sticker preferences, we design a representation learning model to learn discriminative user representations. It is trained on three prediction tasks that leverage personal information and click history; and (ii) To generate stickers aligned with a user's query intent, we propose a novel intent-aware learning objective that prioritizes stickers associated with higher-ranked intents. Empirical results from both offline evaluations and online tests demonstrate that PEARL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP2025</p></details> |

We first train a pose autoencoder that encodes sign poses into a compact latent space using an articulator-based disentanglement strategy, where features corresponding to the face, right hand, left hand, and body are modeled separately to promote structured and interpretable representation learning. Next, a non-autoregressive transformer decoder is trained to predict these latent representations from word-level text embeddings of the input sentence. To guide this process, we apply channel-aware regularization by aligning predicted latent distributions with priors extracted from the ground-truth encodings using a KL divergence loss. The contribution of each channel to the loss is weighted according to its associated articulator region, enabling the model to account for the relative importance of different articulators during training. Our approach does not rely on gloss supervision or pretrained models, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[An Efficient Self-Supervised Framework for Long-Sequence EEG Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17873v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals generally exhibit low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and high inter-subject variability, making generalization across subjects and domains challenging. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly self-supervised learning with Transformer-based architectures, have shown promise in EEG representation learning. However, their quadratic computational complexity increases memory usage and slows inference, making them inefficient for modeling long-range dependencies. Moreover, most existing approaches emphasize either explicit window segmentation of the temporal signal or spectral-only input embedding while neglecting raw temporal dynamics. In this paper, we propose EEGM2, a self-supervised framework that overcomes these limitations. EEGM2 adopts a U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture integrated with Mamba-2 to achieve linear computational complexity, thereby reducing memory usage and improving inference speed. Meanwhile, the selective information propagation mechanism of Mamba-2 enables the model to effectively capture and preserve long-range dependencies in raw EEG signals, where traditional RNN or CNN architectures often struggle. Moreover, EEGM2 employs a self-supervised pre-training objective that reconstructs raw EEG using a combined L1 and spectral (Fourier-based) loss, enhancing generalization by jointly preserving temporal dynamics and spectral characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that EEGM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-sequence modeling and classification. Further evaluations show that EEGM2 consistently outperforms existing models, demonstrating strong generalization across subjects and tasks, as well as transferability across domains. Overall, EEGM2 offers an efficient and scalable solution suitable for deployment on resource-constrained brain-computer interface (BCI) devices.</p></details> | 10 pages |

In Earth observation, early multimodal data fusion methods were based on specific neural network architectures and supervised learning. Ever since, the scarcity of labeled data has motivated self-supervised learning techniques. State-of-the-art multimodal representation learning techniques leverage the spatial alignment between satellite data from different modalities acquired over the same geographic area in order to foster a semantic alignment in the latent space. In this paper, we investigate how this methods can preserve task-relevant information that is not shared across modalities. First, we show, under simplifying assumptions, when alignment strategies fundamentally lead to an information loss. Then, we support our theoretical insight through numerical experiments in more realistic settings. With those theoretical and empirical evidences, we hope to support new developments in contrastive learning for the combination of multimodal satellite data.

While Transformer-based models have advanced time series tasks, they often struggle with feature redundancy and limited generalization capabilities. Drawing inspiration from classical CNN architectures' pyramidal structure, we propose a Multi-Scale Representation Learning Framework based on a Conv-like ScaleFusion Transformer. Our approach introduces a temporal convolution-like structure that combines patching operations with multi-head attention, enabling progressive temporal dimension compression and feature channel expansion. We further develop a novel cross-scale attention mechanism for effective feature fusion across different temporal scales, along with a log-space normalization method for variable-length sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior feature independence, reduced redundancy, and better performance in forecasting and classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes TACTFL, a unified framework for semi-supervised multi-modal federated learning. TACTFL introduces a modality-agnostic temporal contrastive training scheme that conducts representation learning from unlabelled client data by leveraging temporal alignment across modalities. However, as clients perform self-supervised training on heterogeneous data, local models may diverge semantically. To mitigate this, TACTFL incorporates a similarity-guided model aggregation strategy that dynamically weights client models based on their representational consistency, promoting global alignment. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and modalities, including video, audio, and wearable sensors, demonstrate that TACTFL achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, on the UCF101 dataset with only 10% labelled data, TACTFL attains 68.48% top-1 accuracy, significantly outperforming the FedOpt baseline of 35.35%.

Models like wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT have achieved state-of-the-art results in tasks such as speech recognition, particularly in monolingual settings. However, multilingual SSL models tend to underperform their monolingual counterparts on each individual language, especially in multilingual scenarios with few languages such as the bilingual setting. In this work, we investigate a novel approach to reduce this performance gap by introducing limited visual grounding into bilingual speech SSL models. Our results show that visual grounding benefits both monolingual and bilingual models, with especially pronounced gains for the latter, reducing the multilingual performance gap on zero-shot phonetic discrimination from 31.5% for audio-only models to 8.04% with grounding.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Revisiting Bisimulation Metric for Robust Representations in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18519v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks. However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Audio Contrastive-based Fine-tuning: Decoupling Representation Learning and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11895v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard fine-tuning of pre-trained audio models couples representation learning with classifier training, which can obscure the true quality of the learned representations. In this work, we advocate for a disentangled two-stage framework that separates representation refinement from downstream evaluation. First, we employ a "contrastive-tuning" stage to explicitly improve the geometric structure of the model's embedding space. Subsequently, we introduce a dual-probe evaluation protocol to assess the quality of these refined representations from a geometric perspective. This protocol uses a linear probe to measure global linear separability and a k-Nearest Neighbours probe to investigate the local structure of class clusters. Our experiments on a diverse set of audio classification tasks show that our framework provides a better foundation for classification, leading to improved accuracy. Our newly proposed dual-probing framework acts as a powerful analytical lens, demonstrating why contrastive learning is more effective by revealing a superior embedding space. It significantly outperforms vanilla fine-tuning, particularly on single-label datasets with a large number of classes, and also surpasses strong baselines on multi-label tasks using a Jaccard-weighted loss. Our findings demonstrate that decoupling representation refinement from classifier training is a broadly effective strategy for unlocking the full potential of pre-trained audio models. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to ICASSP 2026 and is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[GraphTorque: Torque-Driven Rewiring Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21422v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process, motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to improve representation learning in heterophilous and homophilous graphs. Specifically, we define the torque by treating the feature distance as a lever arm vector and the neighbor feature as a force vector weighted by the homophily disparity between nodes. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing the impact of irrelevant information and boosting pertinent signals during message passing. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art rewiring methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large language models have further improved the ability to extract meaningful representations from clinical texts. However, clinical notes are often missing. For example, in our analysis of the MIMIC-IV dataset, 24.5% of patients have no available discharge summaries. In such cases, representations can be learned from other modalities such as structured data, chest X-rays, or radiology reports. Yet the availability of these modalities is influenced by clinical decision-making and varies across patients, resulting in modality missing-not-at-random (MMNAR) patterns. We propose a causal representation learning framework that leverages observed data and informative missingness in multimodal clinical records. It consists of: (1) an MMNAR-aware modality fusion component that integrates structured data, imaging, and text while conditioning on missingness patterns to capture patient health and clinician-driven assignment; (2) a modality reconstruction component with contrastive learning to ensure semantic sufficiency in representation learning; and (3) a multitask outcome prediction model with a rectifier that corrects for residual bias from specific modality observation patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across MIMIC-IV and eICU show consistent gains over the strongest baselines, achieving up to 13.8% AUC improvement for hospital readmission and 13.1% for ICU admission.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proc. of EMNLP 2025 (18 pages)</p></details> |
| **[VQToken: Neural Discrete Token Representation Learning for Extreme Token Reduction in Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16980v6)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Token-based video representation has emerged as a promising approach for enabling large language models (LLMs) to interpret video content. However, existing token reduction techniques, such as pruning and merging, often disrupt essential positional embeddings and rely on continuous visual tokens sampled from nearby pixels with similar spatial-temporal locations. By removing only a small fraction of tokens, these methods still produce relatively lengthy continuous sequences, which falls short of the extreme compression required to balance computational efficiency and token count in video LLMs. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Extreme Short Token Reduction, which aims to represent entire videos using a minimal set of discrete tokens. We propose VQToken, a neural discrete token representation framework that (i) applies adaptive vector quantization to continuous ViT embeddings to learn a compact codebook and (ii) preserves spatial-temporal positions via a token hash function by assigning each grid-level token to its nearest codebook entry. On the Extreme Short Token Reduction task, our VQToken compresses sequences to just 0.07 percent of their original length while incurring only a 0.66 percent drop in accuracy on the NextQA-MC benchmark. It also achieves comparable performance on ActNet-QA, Long Video Bench, and VideoMME. We further introduce the Token Information Density (TokDense) metric and formalize fixed-length and adaptive-length subtasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in both settings. Our approach dramatically lowers theoretical complexity, increases information density, drastically reduces token counts, and enables efficient video LLMs in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

We believe they hold strong promise for this domain. To unlock this potential, we explicitly align past and future representations, thereby bridging the distributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we introduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that establishes a new representation paradigm, distinct from contrastive learning, by aligning auxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeding them back into any base forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its superior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arise primarily from correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future outputs. Additionally, we provide two theoretical justifications for how reconstruction improves forecasting generalization and how alignment increases the mutual information between learned representations and predicted targets.

Unlike prior approaches relying on text or vision, STAR leverages speech as it constitutes a natural modality for interaction. As an initial step to validate the feasibility of the system, we demonstrate through representation learning experiments that spoken sound event semantics can be effectively extracted from raw speech, capturing both auditory events and scene cues. Leveraging the semantic representations, STAR incorporates a bridge network for representation mapping and a two-stage training strategy to achieve end-to-end synthesis. With a 76.9% reduction in speech processing latency, STAR demonstrates superior generation performance over the cascaded systems. Overall, STAR establishes speech as a direct interaction signal for audio generation, thereby bridging representation learning and multimodal synthesis.

| **[DeepInsert: Early Layer Bypass for Efficient and Performant Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19327v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hyperscaling of data and parameter count in transformer models is yielding diminishing performance improvement, especially when weighed against training costs. Such plateauing underlines a growing need for more efficient finetuning and inference, without sacrificing performance. This is particularly pressing for multimodal learning, where the overhead of processing multimodal tokens alongside language data often limits the practical viability of these systems. In parallel, advances in representation learning and interpretability have deepened our understanding of how such models process and encode information. Notably, recent work has uncovered implicit cross-modal alignment in the deeper layers of large pretrained models. Interestingly, this aligns with our own observations that models naturally defer most cross-modal token interactions to deeper stages of computation. Building on this, we propose a simple modification. Instead of concatenation with the language prompt at the start, we insert multimodal tokens directly into the middle, allowing them to entirely bypass the early layers. Our results with diverse modalities: 1) LLaVA \& BLIP for vision, 2) LTU for audio, and 3) MoLCA for molecular data, indicate that our method reduces computational costs during both training and inference, while at the very least, preserving, if not surpassing the performance of existing baselines. Our work has important implications for scaling and composing pretrained models in a resource-efficient manner.</p></details> |  |

We consider a setting where the UL CCM is mapped to DL CCM by a mapping function. We first present a theoretical error analysis of learning a nonlinear embedding by constructing a mapping function, which points to the importance of the Lipschitz regularity of the mapping function for achieving high estimation performance. Then, based on the theoretical ground, we propose a representation learning algorithm as a solution for the estimation problem, where Gaussian RBF kernel interpolators are chosen to map UL CCMs to their DL counterparts. The proposed algorithm is based on the optimization of an objective function that fits a regression model between the DL CCM and UL CCM samples in the training dataset and preserves the local geometric structure of the data in the UL CCM space, while explicitly regulating the Lipschitz continuity of the mapping function in light of our theoretical findings. The proposed algorithm surpasses benchmark methods in terms of three error metrics as shown by simulations.</p></details> |  |

To achieve better performance on downstream tasks such as gene expression prediction, large-scale pre-training is required to obtain generalisable representations that can bridge histology and transcriptomics across tissues, protocols, and laboratories. Existing cross-modal pre-training approaches for spatial transcriptomics rely on either gene names or expression values in isolation, which strips the gene branch of essential semantics and breaks the association between each gene and its quantitative magnitude. In addition, by restricting supervision to image-text alignment, these methods ignore intrinsic visual cues that are critical for learning robust image features. We present CoMTIP, the first Contrastive Masked Text-Image Pretraining framework that jointly learns from images, gene names, and expression values while capturing fine-grained visual context for spatial transcriptomics. The vision branch uses Masked Feature Modeling to reconstruct occluded patches and learn context-aware image embeddings. The text branch applies a scalable Gene-Text Encoder that processes all gene sentences in parallel, enriches each gene and its numerical value with dedicated embeddings, and employs Pair-aware Adversarial Training (PAAT) to preserve correct gene-value associations. Image and text representations are aligned in a shared InfoNCE-optimised space. Experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets show that CoMTIP not only surpasses previous methods on diverse downstream tasks but also achieves zero-shot gene expression prediction, a capability that existing approaches do not provide.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced semantic distinctions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While this emerging field shows tremendous promise in applications, it faces significant challenges in motion consistency, computational efficiency, and ethical considerations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of diffusion-based video generation, examining its evolution, technical foundations, and practical applications. We present a systematic taxonomy of current methodologies, analyze architectural innovations and optimization strategies, and investigate applications across low-level vision tasks such as denoising and super-resolution. Additionally, we explore the synergies between diffusionbased video generation and related domains, including video representation learning, question answering, and retrieval. Compared to the existing surveys (Lei et al., 2024a;b; Melnik et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2023; Xing et al., 2024c) which focus on specific aspects of video generation, such as human video synthesis (Lei et al., 2024a) or long-form content generation (Lei et al., 2024b), our work provides a broader, more updated, and more fine-grained perspective on diffusion-based approaches with a special section for evaluation metrics, industry solutions, and training engineering techniques in video generation.

However, due to the high training cost and inconsistencies in learned representations, there is significant interest in facilitating communication between representations and ensuring compatibility across independently trained neural networks. In the literature, two primary approaches are commonly used to adapt different learned representations: affine transformations, which adapt well to specific distributions but can significantly alter the original representation, and orthogonal transformations, which preserve the original structure with strict geometric constraints but limit adaptability. A key challenge is adapting the latent spaces of updated models to align with those of previous models on downstream distributions while preserving the newly learned representation spaces. In this paper, we impose a relaxed orthogonality constraint, namely $\lambda$-orthogonality regularization, while learning an affine transformation, to obtain distribution-specific adaptation while retaining the original learned representations. Extensive experiments across various architectures and datasets validate our approach, demonstrating that it preserves the model's zero-shot performance and ensures compatibility across model updates.

| **[Tight PAC-Bayesian Risk Certificates for Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03486v4)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive representation learning is a modern paradigm for learning representations of unlabeled data via augmentations -- precisely, contrastive models learn to embed semantically similar pairs of samples (positive pairs) closer than independently drawn samples (negative samples). In spite of its empirical success and widespread use in foundation models, statistical theory for contrastive learning remains less explored. Recent works have developed generalization error bounds for contrastive losses, but the resulting risk certificates are either vacuous (certificates based on Rademacher complexity or $f$-divergence) or require strong assumptions about samples that are unreasonable in practice. The present paper develops non-vacuous PAC-Bayesian risk certificates for contrastive representation learning, considering the practical considerations of the popular SimCLR framework. Notably, we take into account that SimCLR reuses positive pairs of augmented data as negative samples for other data, thereby inducing strong dependence and making classical PAC or PAC-Bayesian bounds inapplicable. We further refine existing bounds on the downstream classification loss by incorporating SimCLR-specific factors, including data augmentation and temperature scaling, and derive risk certificates for the contrastive zero-one risk. The resulting bounds for contrastive loss and downstream prediction are much tighter than those of previous risk certificates, as demonstrated by experiments on CIFAR-10.</p></details> |  |
| **[TF-DWGNet: A Directed Weighted Graph Neural Network with Tensor Fusion for Multi-Omics Cancer Subtype Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16301v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integration and analysis of multi-omics data provide valuable insights for cancer subtype classification. However, such data are inherently heterogeneous, high-dimensional, and exhibit complex intra- and inter-modality dependencies. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer powerful tools for modeling such structure. Yet, most existing methods rely on prior knowledge or predefined similarity networks to construct graphs, which are often undirected or unweighted, failing to capture the directionality and strength of biological interactions. Interpretability at both the modality and feature levels also remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose TF-DWGNet, a novel Graph Neural Network framework that combines tree-based Directed Weighted graph construction with Tensor Fusion for multiclass cancer subtype classification. TF-DWGNet introduces two key innovations: a supervised tree-based approach for constructing directed, weighted graphs tailored to each omics modality, and a tensor fusion mechanism that captures unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal interactions using low-rank decomposition for efficiency. TF-DWGNet enables modality-specific representation learning, joint embedding fusion, and interpretable subtype prediction.

In this paper, we propose Dual-Masked Autoencoder (DMAE), a novel masked time-series modeling framework for unsupervised MTS representation learning. DMAE formulates two complementary pretext tasks: (1) reconstructing masked values based on visible attributes, and (2) estimating latent representations of masked features, guided by a teacher encoder. To further improve representation quality, we introduce a feature-level alignment constraint that encourages the predicted latent representations to align with the teacher's outputs. By jointly optimizing these objectives, DMAE learns temporally coherent and semantically rich representations. Comprehensive evaluations across classification, regression, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves consistent and superior performance over competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |

Although numerous deep learning-based automatic segmentation methods have been developed, they still struggle to segment small, irregular, or anatomically complex organs. Moreover, most current methods focus on spatial-domain analysis, often overlooking the synergistic potential of frequency-domain representations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework named FMD-TransUNet for precise abdominal multi-organ segmentation. It innovatively integrates the Multi-axis External Weight Block (MEWB) and the improved dual attention module (DA+) into the TransUNet framework. The MEWB extracts multi-axis frequency-domain features to capture both global anatomical structures and local boundary details, providing complementary information to spatial-domain representations. The DA+ block utilizes depthwise separable convolutions and incorporates spatial and channel attention mechanisms to enhance feature fusion, reduce redundant information, and narrow the semantic gap between the encoder and decoder. Experimental validation on the Synapse dataset shows that FMD-TransUNet outperforms other recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average DSC of 81.32\% and a HD of 16.35 mm across eight abdominal organs. Compared to the baseline model, the average DSC increased by 3.84\%, and the average HD decreased by 15.34 mm. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of FMD-TransUNet in improving the accuracy of abdominal multi-organ segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Electrocardiogram (ECG) is critical for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac health, but obtaining large-scale annotated ECG datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent ECG Self-Supervised Learning (eSSL) methods mitigate this by learning features without extensive labels but fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and require extensive task-specific fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SuPreME}$, a $\textbf{Su}$pervised $\textbf{Pre}$-training framework for $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{E}$CG representation learning. SuPreME is pre-trained using structured diagnostic labels derived from ECG report entities through a one-time offline extraction with Large Language Models (LLMs), which help denoise, standardize cardiac concepts, and improve clinical representation learning. By fusing ECG signals with textual cardiac queries instead of fixed labels, SuPreME enables zero-shot classification of unseen conditions without further fine-tuning. We evaluate SuPreME on six downstream datasets covering 106 cardiac conditions, achieving superior zero-shot AUC performance of $77.20\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art eSSLs by $4.98\%$. Results demonstrate SuPreME's effectiveness in leveraging structured, clinically relevant knowledge for high-quality ECG representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of The 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025)</p></details> |

However, its progress is impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical image understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Upon ...</summary><p>Upon further review, we identified that our dataset requires optimization to ensure research reliability and accuracy.

While the continuous influx of new, unlabeled audio presents an opportunity to enrich these static representations, a naive approach is to retrain the model from scratch using all available data. However, this method is computationally prohibitive and discards the valuable knowledge embedded in the previously trained model weights. To address this inefficiency, we propose SONAR (Self-distilled cONtinual pre-training for domain adaptive Audio Representation), a continual pre-training framework built upon BEATs. SONAR effectively adapts to new domains while mitigating catastrophic forgetting by tackling three key challenges: implementing a joint sampling strategy for new and prior data, applying regularization to balance specificity and generality, and dynamically expanding the tokenizer codebook for novel acoustic patterns. Experiments across four distinct domains demonstrate that our method achieves both high adaptability and robust resistance to forgetting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[DiRW: Path-Aware Digraph Learning for Heterophily](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10320v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has emerged as a powerful representation learning tool for graph-structured data. However, most approaches are tailored for undirected graphs, neglecting the abundant information in the edges of directed graphs (digraphs). In fact, digraphs are widely applied in the real world and confirmed to address heterophily challenges. Despite recent advancements, existing spatial- and spectral-based DiGNNs have limitations due to their complex learning mechanisms and reliance on high-quality topology, resulting in low efficiency and unstable performance. To address these issues, we propose Directed Random Walk (DiRW), a plug-and-play strategy for most spatial-based DiGNNs and also an innovative model which offers a new digraph learning paradigm. Specifically, it utilizes a direction-aware path sampler optimized from the perspectives of walk probability, length, and number in a weight-free manner by considering node profiles and topologies. Building upon this, DiRW incorporates a node-wise learnable path aggregator for generalized node representations. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that DiRW: (1) enhances most spatial-based methods as a plug-and-play strategy; (2) achieves SOTA performance as a new digraph learning paradigm.

| **[Latent Zoning Network: A Unified Principle for Generative Modeling, Representation Learning, and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15591v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three core problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN) as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images, text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently (representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously (joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders, LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA classification accuracy on CIFAR10.

Existing methods, including Transformer and MLP-based models, often struggle to capture these intertwined characteristics in a unified and structured manner. We propose the Dual Pyramid Attention Network (DPANet), a novel architecture that explicitly decouples and concurrently models temporal multi-scale dynamics and spectral multi-resolution periodicities. DPANet constructs two parallel pyramids: a Temporal Pyramid built on progressive downsampling, and a Frequency Pyramid built on band-pass filtering. The core of our model is the Cross-Pyramid Fusion Block, which facilitates deep, interactive information exchange between corresponding pyramid levels via cross-attention. This fusion proceeds in a coarse-to-fine hierarchy, enabling global context to guide local representation learning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that DPANet achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming prior models.

A core challenge in speech SSL is generating pseudo-labels that are both informative and efficient: strong labels, such as those used in HuBERT, improve downstream performance but rely on external encoders and multi-stage pipelines, while efficient methods like BEST-RQ achieve simplicity at the cost of weaker labels. We propose BiRQ, a bilevel SSL framework that combines the efficiency of BEST-RQ with the refinement benefits of HuBERT-style label enhancement. The key idea is to reuse part of the model itself as a pseudo-label generator: intermediate representations are discretized by a random-projection quantizer to produce enhanced labels, while anchoring labels derived directly from the raw input stabilize training and prevent collapse. Training is formulated as an efficient first-order bilevel optimization problem, solved end-to-end with differentiable Gumbel-softmax selection. This design eliminates the need for external label encoders, reduces memory cost, and enables iterative label refinement in an end-to-end fashion. BiRQ consistently improves over BEST-RQ while maintaining low complexity and computational efficiency. We validate our method on various datasets, including 960-hour LibriSpeech, 150-hour AMI meetings and 5,000-hour YODAS, demonstrating consistent gains over BEST-RQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages including reference</p></details> |

However, despite their crucial role in shaping tactile experiences, these material characteristics have been largely neglected in existing tactile representation learning methods. Most approaches primarily focus on aligning tactile data with visual or textual information, overlooking the richness of tactile feedback that comes from understanding the materials' inherent properties. In this work, we address this gap by revisiting the tactile representation learning framework and incorporating material-aware priors into the learning process. These priors, which represent pre-learned characteristics specific to different materials, allow tactile models to better capture and generalize the nuances of surface texture. Our method enables more accurate, contextually rich tactile feedback across diverse materials and textures, improving performance in real-world applications such as robotics, haptic feedback systems, and material editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This publication has infringed on the authorship rights of other researchers.

In contrast, prevailing machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition.

With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Graph Neural Networks are Incomplete on Graphs with a Simple Spectrum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05530v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet, these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on graphs from ZINC.</p></details> | 10 pages main text |
| **[AI-Enhanced Multi-Dimensional Measurement of Technological Convergence through Heterogeneous Graph and Semantic Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21187v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technological convergence refers to the phenomenon where boundaries between technological areas and disciplines are increasingly blurred. It enables the integration of previously distinct domains and has become a mainstream trend in today's innovation process. However, accurately measuring technological convergence remains a persistent challenge due to its inherently multidimensional and evolving nature. This study designs an Technological Convergence Index (TCI) that comprehensively measures convergence along two fundamental dimensions: depth and breadth. For depth calculation, we use IPC textual descriptions as the analytical foundation and enhance this assessment by incorporating supplementary patent metadata into a heterogeneous graph structure. This graph is then modeled using Heterogeneous Graph Transformers in combination with Sentence-BERT, enabling a precise representation of knowledge integration across technological boundaries. Complementing this, the breadth dimension captures the diversity of technological fields involved, quantified through the Shannon Diversity Index to measure the variety of technological combinations within patents. Our final TCI is constructed using the Entropy Weight Method, which objectively assigns weights to both dimensions based on their information entropy. To validate our approach, we compare the proposed TCI against established convergence measures, demonstrating its comparative advantages. We further establish empirical reliability through a novel robustness test that regresses TCI against indicators of patent quality. These findings are further substantiated through comprehensive robustness checks. Our multidimensional approach provides valuable practical insights for innovation policy and industry strategies in managing emerging cross-domain technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphUniverse: Enabling Systematic Evaluation of Inductive Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21097v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph, transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure. Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at https://graphuniverse.streamlit.app.</p></details> |  |

Regardless of their successes, current methods frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID) benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts. Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without specialized DG algorithms (on four out of six benchmarks). Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets, specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Highlighting its model-agnostic design, the method yielded valuable insights into both GT and MPNN backbones and appears well suited for broader DG applications beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.</p></details> |  |

Accurate classification of ncRNAs is essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis. To address existing limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion, we propose HGMamba-ncRNA, a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model, which integrates sequence, secondary structure, and optionally available expression features of ncRNAs to enhance classification performance. Specifically, the sequence of ncRNA is modeled using a parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM architecture (MKC-L) to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies of nucleotides. The structure modality employs a multi-scale graph transformer (MSGraphTransformer) to represent the multi-level topological characteristics of ncRNA secondary structures. The expression modality utilizes a Chebyshev Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CPKAN) to effectively model and interpret high-dimensional expression profiles. Finally, by incorporating virtual nodes to facilitate efficient and comprehensive multimodal interaction, HyperGraphMamba is proposed to adaptively align and integrate multichannel heterogeneous modality features. Experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Extensive empirical studies further confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong transferability, offering a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA functional classification.

| **[Local equivalence of stabilizer states: a graphical characterisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20183v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stabilizer states form a ubiquitous family of quantum states that can be graphically represented through the graph state formalism. A fundamental property of graph states is that applying a local complementation - a well-known and extensively studied graph transformation - results in a graph that represents the same entanglement as the original. In other words, the corresponding graph states are LU-equivalent. This property served as the cornerstone for capturing non-trivial quantum properties in a simple graphical manner, in the study of quantum entanglement but also for developing protocols and models based on graph states and stabilizer states, such as measurement-based quantum computing, secret sharing, error correction, entanglement distribution... However, local complementation fails short to fully characterise entanglement: there exist pairs of graph states that are LU-equivalent but cannot be transformed one into the other using local complementations. Only few is known about the equivalence of graph states beyond local complementation. We introduce a generalisation of local complementation which graphically characterises the LU-equivalence of graph states. We use this characterisation to show the existence of a strict infinite hierarchy of equivalences of graph states. Our approach is based on minimal local sets, which are subsets of vertices that are known to cover any graph, and to be invariant under local complementation and even LU-equivalence. We use these structures to provide a type to each vertex of a graph, leading to a natural standard form in which the LU-equivalence can be exhibited and captured by means of generalised local complementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[IPGPhormer: Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer for Survival Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12381v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological images play an essential role in cancer prognosis, while survival analysis, which integrates computational techniques, can predict critical clinical events such as patient mortality or disease recurrence from whole-slide images (WSIs). Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method, IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology. The code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IPGPhormer-6EEB.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

We present SolarCAST, a causally informed model predicting future global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a target site using only historical GHI from site X and nearby stations S - unlike prior work that relies on sky-camera or satellite imagery requiring specialized hardware and heavy preprocessing. To deliver high accuracy with only public sensor data, SolarCAST models three classes of confounding factors behind X-S correlations using scalable neural components: (i) observable synchronous variables (e.g., time of day, station identity), handled via an embedding module; (ii) latent synchronous factors (e.g., regional weather patterns), captured by a spatio-temporal graph neural network; and (iii) time-lagged influences (e.g., cloud movement across stations), modeled with a gated transformer that learns temporal shifts. It outperforms leading time-series and multimodal baselines across diverse geographical conditions, and achieves a 25.9% error reduction over the top commercial forecaster, Solcast. SolarCAST offers a lightweight, practical, and generalizable solution for localized solar forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2025</p></details> |

The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer, featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping linear complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12694v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural architecture designed for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages with 3 figures and 2 tables, submitted to IEEE for a possible publication</p></details> |
| **[State Space Models over Directed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13735v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed graphs are ubiquitous across numerous domains, where the directionality of edges encodes critical causal dependencies. However, existing GNNs and graph Transformers tailored for directed graphs face two major challenges: (1) effectively capturing long-range causal dependencies derived from directed edges; (2) balancing accuracy and training efficiency when processing large-scale graph datasets. In recent years, state space models (SSMs) have achieved substantial progress in causal sequence tasks, and their variants designed for graphs have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining high efficiency across various graph learning benchmarks. However, existing graph state space models are exclusively designed for undirected graphs, which limits their performance in directed graph learning. To this end, we propose an innovative approach DirEgo2Token which sequentializes directed graphs via k-hop ego graphs. This marks the first systematic extension of state space models to the field of directed graph learning. Building upon this, we develop DirGraphSSM, a novel directed graph neural network architecture that implements state space models on directed graphs via the message-passing mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that DirGraphSSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three representative directed graph learning tasks while attaining competitive performance on two additional tasks with 1.5$\times $ to 2$\times $ training speed improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently undergoing review by IEEE Transactions on Big Data</p></details> |
| **[GRATE: a Graph transformer-based deep Reinforcement learning Approach for Time-efficient autonomous robot Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12863v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robot exploration (ARE) is the process of a robot autonomously navigating and mapping an unknown environment. Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approaches typically formulate ARE as a sequential decision-making problem defined on a collision-free informative graph. However, these methods often demonstrate limited reasoning ability over graph-structured data. Moreover, due to the insufficient consideration of robot motion, the resulting RL policies are generally optimized to minimize travel distance, while neglecting time efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRATE, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approach that leverages a Graph Transformer to effectively capture both local structure patterns and global contextual dependencies of the informative graph, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning capability across the entire environment. In addition, we deploy a Kalman filter to smooth the waypoint outputs, ensuring that the resulting path is kinodynamically feasible for the robot to follow. Experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits better exploration efficiency (up to 21.5% in distance and 21.3% in time to complete exploration) than state-of-the-art conventional and learning-based baselines in various simulation benchmarks. We also validate our planner in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Homophily Booster: Rethinking the Role of Discrete Features on Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12530v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs.</p></details> | 14 pages |

In this work, we design and benchmark an NQS impurity solver for the quantum embedding methods, focusing on the ghost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA) framework. We introduce a graph transformer-based NQS framework able to represent arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and develop an error control mechanism to stabilise iterative updates throughout the quantum embedding loops. We validate the accuracy of our approach with benchmark gGA calculations of the Anderson Lattice Model, yielding results in excellent agreement with the exact diagonalisation impurity solver. Finally, our analysis of the computational budget reveals the method's principal bottleneck to be the high-accuracy sampling of physical observables required by the embedding loop, rather than the NQS variational optimisation, directly highlighting the critical need for more efficient inference techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, and 4 figures.

| **[GTHNA: Local-global Graph Transformer with Memory Reconstruction for Holistic Node Anomaly Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10869v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in graph-structured data is an inherently challenging problem, as it requires the identification of rare nodes that deviate from the majority in both their structural and behavioral characteristics. Existing methods, such as those based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), often suffer from over-smoothing, which causes the learned node representations to become indistinguishable. Furthermore, graph reconstruction-based approaches are vulnerable to anomalous node interference during the reconstruction process, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a novel and holistic anomaly evaluation framework that integrates three key components: a local-global Transformer encoder, a memory-guided reconstruction mechanism, and a multi-scale representation matching strategy. These components work synergistically to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and global structural dependencies, suppress the influence of anomalous nodes, and assess anomalies from multiple levels of granularity. Anomaly scores are computed by combining reconstruction errors and memory matching signals, resulting in a more robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering a comprehensive and generalizable solution for anomaly detection across various graph domains.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Database Views as Explanations for Relational Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09482v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash, Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSRFormer: Road Network Representation Learning using Multi-scale Feature Fusion of Heterogeneous Spatial Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05685v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer, MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections, which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow heterogeneity of spatial interactions.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective cross-lingual generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Found...</summary><p>Found some issues and need to correct them</p></details> |

However, in tasks involving natural language and programming language (NL-PL) artifacts, relying solely on textual similarity is limited by their semantic gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical evaluation across various types of TLR tasks, revealing the limitations of textual similarity in NL-PL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an approach that incorporates multiple domain-specific auxiliary strategies, identified through empirical analysis, into two models: the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via edge types and the prompt-based Gemini 2.5 Pro via additional input information. We then evaluated our approach using the widely studied requirements-to-code TLR task, a representative case of NL-PL TLR. Experimental results show that both the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models outperformed their original counterparts without strategy integration. Furthermore, compared to the current state-of-the-art method HGNNLink, the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models achieved average F1-score improvements of 3.68% and 8.84%, respectively, across twelve open-source projects, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy integration in enhancing overall model performance for the requirements-code TLR task.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 5 images, 11 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Graph Transformer-Based Flood Susceptibility Mapping: Application to the French Riviera and Railway Infrastructure Under Climate Change](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03727v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasing flood frequency and severity due to climate change threatens infrastructure and demands improved susceptibility mapping techniques. While traditional machine learning (ML) approaches are widely used, they struggle to capture spatial dependencies and poor boundary delineation between susceptibility classes. This study introduces the first application of a graph transformer (GT) architecture for flood susceptibility mapping to the flood-prone French Riviera (e.g., 2020 Storm Alex) using topography, hydrology, geography, and environmental data. GT incorporates watershed topology using Laplacian positional encoders (PEs) and attention mechanisms. The developed GT model has an AUC-ROC (0.9739), slightly lower than XGBoost (0.9853). However, the GT model demonstrated better clustering and delineation with a higher Moran's I value (0.6119) compared to the random forest (0.5775) and XGBoost (0.5311) with p-value lower than 0.0001. Feature importance revealed a striking consistency across models, with elevation, slope, distance to channel, and convergence index being the critical factors. Dimensionality reduction on Laplacian PEs revealed partial clusters, indicating they could capture spatial information; however, their importance was lower than flood factors. Since climate and land use changes aggravate flood risk, susceptibility maps are developed for the 2050 year under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and railway track vulnerability is assessed. All RCP scenarios revealed increased area across susceptibility classes, except for the very low category. RCP 8.5 projections indicate that 17.46% of the watershed area and 54% of railway length fall within very-high susceptible zones, compared to 6.19% and 35.61%, respectively, under current conditions. The developed maps can be integrated into a multi-hazard framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained, local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance. Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.</p></details> |  |

Graph Transformers (GTs) mitigate this via global self-attention, yet their quadratic cost in the number of nodes limits scalability. We propose Graph Elimination Networks (GENs), an MPNN variant that approximates GT-like long-range modeling while maintaining high efficiency. GENs combine edge-wise and hop-wise self-attention in parallel; their multiplicative composition yields an attention kernel separable across edge and hop factors within a bounded K-hop receptive field. To enable hop-wise attention, we introduce the Graph Elimination Algorithm (GEA), which prevents double counting across hops, ensuring that each round injects the k-hop incremental contribution exactly once. Taking differences between successive rounds recovers the k-hop increment and yields disentangled multi-hop features as inputs for hop-wise attention. This preserves clearer structural distinctions across hop distances and enables more faithful modeling of pairwise dependencies between distant nodes within the K-hop neighborhood. On the Long-Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB), GENs outperform strong MPNN baselines by 7.7 and 6.0 percentage points (pp) on PascalVOC-SP and COCO-SP, and achieve performance on par with or better than state-of-the-art Graph Transformers. On OGBN-Products, GENs support full-batch training/inference, while sparse-attention baselines like Exphormer struggle with memory limits under comparable budgets, highlighting GENs as a practical alternative for large, sparse graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inclu...</summary><p>Includes 11 pages of main text and 6 pages of appendices</p></details> |

Integrating graph generation with these instructions is complex, leading most current methods to use molecular sequences with pre-trained large language models. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel framework, named $\textbf{UTGDiff (Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model)}$, which utilizes language models for discrete graph diffusion to generate molecular graphs from instructions. UTGDiff features a unified text-graph transformer as the denoising network, derived from pre-trained language models and minimally modified to process graph data through attention bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that UTGDiff consistently outperforms sequence-based baselines in tasks involving instruction-based molecule generation and editing, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters given an equivalent level of pretraining corpus.

Graph transformers have become increasingly important in graph learning for their ability to utilize long-range node communication explicitly, addressing limitations such as oversmoothing and oversquashing found in message-passing graph networks. However, their dense attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of nodes, limiting their applicability to large-scale graphs. ReHub draws inspiration from the airline industry's hub-and-spoke model, where flights are assigned to optimize operational efficiency. In our approach, graph nodes (spokes) are dynamically reassigned to a fixed number of virtual nodes (hubs) at each model layer. Recent work, Neural Atoms (Li et al., 2024), has demonstrated impressive and consistent improvements over GNN baselines by utilizing such virtual nodes; their findings suggest that the number of hubs strongly influences performance. However, increasing the number of hubs typically raises complexity, requiring a trade-off to maintain linear complexity. Our key insight is that each node only needs to interact with a small subset of hubs to achieve linear complexity, even when the total number of hubs is large. To leverage all hubs without incurring additional computational costs, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive reassignment technique based on hub-hub similarity scores, eliminating the need for expensive node-hub computations. Our experiments on LRGB indicate a consistent improvement in results over the base method, Neural Atoms, while maintaining a linear complexity. Remarkably, our sparse model achieves performance on par with its non-sparse counterpart. Furthermore, ReHub outperforms competitive baselines and consistently ranks among top performers across various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025.

These architectures have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size, adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller. The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while having a similar training speed.

This enables precise control over both the content and temporal structure of the generated audio. Despite recent progress, existing methods still face inherent trade-offs among accurate temporal localization, open-vocabulary scalability, and practical efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose DegDiT, a novel dynamic event graph-guided diffusion transformer framework for open-vocabulary controllable audio generation. DegDiT encodes the events in the description as structured dynamic graphs. The nodes in each graph are designed to represent three aspects: semantic features, temporal attributes, and inter-event connections. A graph transformer is employed to integrate these nodes and produce contextualized event embeddings that serve as guidance for the diffusion model. To ensure high-quality and diverse training data, we introduce a quality-balanced data selection pipeline that combines hierarchical event annotation with multi-criteria quality scoring, resulting in a curated dataset with semantic diversity. Furthermore, we present consensus preference optimization, facilitating audio generation through consensus among multiple reward signals. Extensive experiments on AudioCondition, DESED, and AudioTime datasets demonstrate that DegDiT achieves state-of-the-art performances across a variety of objective and subjective evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, cross-subject generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to individual variability, cognitive traits, and emotional responses. We propose FreqDGT, a frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer that systematically addresses these limitations through an integrated framework. FreqDGT introduces frequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant frequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic graph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and implements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines hierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to capture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of integrating frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical modeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences.

Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived graph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or anomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805 without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches. With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to 0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a graph neural network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity. Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation. To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently demonstrated remarkable ability to exploit relational structures in biological data, enabling advances in multi-omics integration for cancer subtype classification. Existing approaches often neglect the intricate coupling between heterogeneous omics, limiting their capacity to resolve subtle cancer subtype heterogeneity critical for precision oncology. To address these limitations, we propose a framework named Graph Transformer for Multi-omics Cancer Subtype Classification (GTMancer). This framework builds upon the GNN optimization problem and extends its application to complex multi-omics data. Specifically, our method leverages contrastive learning to embed multi-omics data into a unified semantic space. We unroll the multiplex graph optimization problem in that unified space and introduce dual sets of attention coefficients to capture structural graph priors both within and among multi-omics data.

| **[Information Bottleneck-Guided Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Interpretable Neurodevelopmental Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20769v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing interpretable models for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) diagnosis presents significant challenges in effectively encoding, decoding, and integrating multimodal neuroimaging data. While many existing machine learning approaches have shown promise in brain network analysis, they typically suffer from limited interpretability, particularly in extracting meaningful biomarkers from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and establishing clear relationships between imaging features and demographic characteristics. Besides, current graph neural network methodologies face limitations in capturing both local and global functional connectivity patterns while simultaneously achieving theoretically principled multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a unified framework that applies information bottleneck principles to guide both brain connectivity modeling and cross-modal feature integration. This framework comprises two complementary components. The first is the Information Bottleneck Graph Transformer (IBGraphFormer), which combines transformer-based global attention mechanisms with graph neural networks through information bottleneck-guided pooling to identify sufficient biomarkers. The second is the Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (IB-HGAN), which employs meta-path-based heterogeneous graph learning with structural consistency constraints to achieve interpretable fusion of neuroimaging and demographic data. The experimental results demonstrate that I2B-HGNN achieves superior performance in diagnosing NDDs, exhibiting both high classification accuracy and the ability to provide interpretable biomarker identification while effectively analyzing non-imaging data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual Graph Transformer: A Small Language Model for Enhanced Engineering Document Information Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02532v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text, often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering. CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram, and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical domains often require specialized language models with stronger contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7% higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented responses in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hypergraph Mamba for Efficient Whole Slide Image Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17457v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in histopathology pose a significant challenge for extensive medical image analysis due to their ultra-high resolution, massive scale, and intricate spatial relationships. Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Generative Modeling of Grounded Scene Graphs and Images via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01130v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a framework for joint grounded scene graph - image generation, a challenging task involving high-dimensional, multi-modal structured data. To effectively model this complex joint distribution, we adopt a factorized approach: first generating a grounded scene graph, followed by image generation conditioned on the generated grounded scene graph. While conditional image generation has been widely explored in the literature, our primary focus is on the generation of grounded scene graphs from noise, which provides efficient and interpretable control over the image generation process. This task requires generating plausible grounded scene graphs with heterogeneous attributes for both nodes (objects) and edges (relations among objects), encompassing continuous attributes (e.g., object bounding boxes) and discrete attributes (e.g., object and relation categories). To address this challenge, we introduce DiffuseSG, a novel diffusion model that jointly models the heterogeneous node and edge attributes. We explore different encoding strategies to effectively handle the categorical data. Leveraging a graph transformer as the denoiser, DiffuseSG progressively refines grounded scene graph representations in a continuous space before discretizing them to generate structured outputs. Additionally, we introduce an IoU-based regularization term to enhance empirical performance. Our model outperforms existing methods in grounded scene graph generation on the VG and COCO-Stuff datasets, excelling in both standard and newly introduced metrics that more accurately capture the task's complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the broader applicability of DiffuseSG in two important downstream tasks: 1) achieving superior results in a range of grounded scene graph completion tasks, and 2) enhancing grounded scene graph detection models by leveraging additional training samples generated by DiffuseSG.</p></details> |  |

We study the expressive power of graph transformers (GTs) by Dwivedi and Bresson (2020) and GPS-networks by Ramp\'asek et al. (2022), both under soft-attention and average hard-attention. Our study covers two scenarios: the theoretical setting with real numbers and the more practical case with floats. With reals, we show that in restriction to vertex properties definable in first-order logic (FO), GPS-networks have the same expressive power as graded modal logic (GML) with the global modality. With floats, GPS-networks turn out to be equally expressive as GML with the counting global modality. The latter result is absolute, not restricting to properties definable in a background logic. We also obtain similar characterizations for GTs in terms of propositional logic with the global modality (for reals) and the counting global modality (for floats).</p></details> |  |
| **[Invariant Graph Transformer for Out-of-Distribution Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00304v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated great effectiveness across various graph analytical tasks. However, the existing GTs focus on training and testing graph data originated from the same distribution, but fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Graph invariant learning, aiming to capture generalizable graph structural patterns with labels under distribution shifts, is potentially a promising solution, but how to design attention mechanisms and positional and structural encodings (PSEs) based on graph invariant learning principles remains challenging. To solve these challenges, we introduce Graph Out-Of-Distribution generalized Transformer (GOODFormer), aiming to learn generalized graph representations by capturing invariant relationships between predictive graph structures and labels through jointly optimizing three modules. Specifically, we first develop a GT-based entropy-guided invariant subgraph disentangler to separate invariant and variant subgraphs while preserving the sharpness of the attention function. Next, we design an evolving subgraph positional and structural encoder to effectively and efficiently capture the encoding information of dynamically changing subgraphs during training. Finally, we propose an invariant learning module utilizing subgraph node representations and encodings to derive generalizable graph representations that can to unseen graphs. We also provide theoretical justifications for our method. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using weakest application conditions to rank graph transformations for graph repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08788v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When using graphs and graph transformations to model systems, consistency is an important concern. While consistency has primarily been viewed as a binary property, i.e., a graph is consistent or inconsistent with respect to a set of constraints, recent work has presented an approach to consistency as a graduated property. This allows living with inconsistencies for a while and repairing them when necessary. For repairing inconsistencies in a graph, we use graph transformation rules with so-called {\em impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions} to understand how much repair gain certain rule applications would bring. Both types of conditions can be derived from given graph constraints. Our main theorem shows that the difference between the number of actual constraint violations before and after a graph transformation step can be characterized by the difference between the numbers of violated impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions. This theory forms the basis for algorithms with look-ahead that rank graph transformations according to their potential for graph repair. An evaluation shows that graph repair can be well supported by rules with these new types of application conditions in terms of effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 25 Figures, new, more efficient method for constructing application conditions, theoretical comparison to other concepts of consistency, extended evaluation</p></details> |
| **[WOCD: A Semi-Supervised Method for Overlapping Community Detection Using Weak Cliques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00927v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Overlapping community detection (OCD) is a fundamental graph data analysis task for extracting graph patterns. Traditional OCD methods can be broadly divided into node clustering and link clustering approaches, both of which rely solely on link information to identify overlapping communities. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have made significant advancements for this task. However, existing GNN-based approaches often face difficulties in effectively integrating link, attribute, and prior information, along with challenges like limited receptive fields and over-smoothing, which hinder their performance on complex overlapping community detection. In this paper, we propose a Weak-clique based Overlapping Community Detection method, namely WOCD, which incorporates prior information and optimizes the use of link information to improve detection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce pseudo-labels within a semi-supervised framework to strengthen the generalization ability, making WOCD more versatile. Furthermore, we initialize pseudo-labels using weak cliques to fully leverage link and prior information, leading to better detection accuracy. Additionally, we employ a single-layer Graph Transformer combined with GNN, which achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining efficiency. We evaluate WOCD on eight real-world attributed datasets, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised OCD method by a significant margin in terms of accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Obfuscation: Cluster-Aware Graph with LLM-Aided Recovery for Malicious JavaScript Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22447v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid expansion of web-based applications and cloud services, malicious JavaScript code continues to pose significant threats to user privacy, system integrity, and enterprise security. But, detecting such threats remains challenging due to sophisticated code obfuscation techniques and JavaScript's inherent language characteristics, particularly its nested closure structures and syntactic flexibility. In this work, we propose DeCoda, a hybrid defense framework that combines large language model (LLM)-based deobfuscation with code graph learning: (1) We first construct a sophisticated prompt-learning pipeline with multi-stage refinement, where the LLM progressively reconstructs the original code structure from obfuscated inputs and then generates normalized Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representations; (2) In JavaScript ASTs, dynamic typing scatters semantically similar nodes while deeply nested functions fracture scope capturing, introducing structural noise and semantic ambiguity. To address these challenges, we then propose to learn hierarchical code graph representations via a Cluster-wise Graph that synergistically integrates graph transformer network, node clustering, and node-to-cluster attention to simultaneously capture both local node-level semantics and global cluster-induced structural relationships from AST graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves F1-scores of 94.64% and 97.71% on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating absolute improvements of 10.74% and 13.85% over state-of-the-art baselines. In false-positive control evaluation at fixed FPR levels (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01), our approach delivers 4.82, 5.91, and 2.53 higher TPR respectively compared to the best-performing baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-based deobfuscation and underscore the importance of modeling cluster-level relationships in detecting malicious code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rule-Based Graph Programs Matching the Time Complexity of Imperative Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09144v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on recent advances in rule-based graph programming, which allow us to match the time complexity of some fundamental imperative graph algorithms. In general, achieving the time complexity of graph algorithms implemented in conventional languages using a rule-based graph-transformation language is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be implemented in the graph programming language GP 2 such that their runtime matches the time complexity of imperative implementations. However, this required input graphs to have a bounded node degree and (for some algorithms) to be connected. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies: the first program checks whether input graphs are connected, the second program checks whether input graphs are acyclic, and the third program solves the single-source shortest-paths problem for graphs with integer edge-weights. The first two programs run in linear time on (possibly disconnected) input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. The third program runs in time $O(nm)$ on arbitrary input graphs, matching the time complexity of imperative implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. For each program, we formally prove its correctness and time complexity, and provide runtime experiments on various graph classes.</p></details> |  |

This study systematically benchmarked classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN)) for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data. This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version; a revised version will be uploaded later</p></details> |

However, the dynamic traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various real-world traffic networks.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges such as over-smoothing and over-compression remain when handling large-scale and complex graph datasets, leading to a decline in clustering quality. Although the Graph Transformer architecture has mitigated some of these issues, its performance is still limited when processing heterogeneous graph data. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep clustering framework that comprising GCN, Autoencoder (AE), and Graph Transformer, termed the Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network (Tri-GFN). This framework enhances the differentiation and consistency of global and local information through a unique tri-learning mechanism and feature fusion enhancement strategy. The framework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer modules. These components are meticulously fused by a triple-channel enhancement module, which maximizes the use of both node attributes and topological structures, ensuring robust clustering representation. The tri-learning mechanism allows mutual learning among these modules, while the feature fusion strategy enables the model to capture complex relationships, yielding highly discriminative representations for graph clustering. It surpasses many state-of-the-art methods, achieving an accuracy improvement of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14 % on the Reuters dataset, and 7.58 % on the USPS dataset. Due to its outstanding performance on the Reuters dataset, Tri-GFN can be applied to automatic news classification, topic retrieval, and related fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code for this study is available at https://github.com/YF-W/Tri-GFN</p></details> |

Here, we propose MGT, a multi-view graph transformer framework that synergistically fuses SE3 invariant and SO3 equivariant graph representations, which respectively captures rotation-translation invariance and rotation equivariance in crystal geometries. To strategically incorporate these complementary geometric representations, we employ a lightweight mixture of experts router in MGT to adaptively adjust the weight assigned to SE3 and SO3 embeddings based on the specific target task. Compared with previous state-of-the-art models, MGT reduces the mean absolute error by up to 21% on crystal property prediction tasks through multi-task self-supervised pretraining. Ablation experiments and interpretable investigations confirm the effectiveness of each technique implemented in our framework. Additionally, in transfer learning scenarios including crystal catalyst adsorption energy and hybrid perovskite bandgap prediction, MGT achieves performance improvements of up to 58% over existing baselines, demonstrating domain-agnostic scalability across diverse application domains. As evidenced by the above series of studies, we believe that MGT can serve as useful model for crystal material property prediction, providing a valuable tool for the discovery of novel materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taint Analysis for Graph APIs Focusing on Broken Access Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08947v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis for Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes in the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use critical pair analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the CPA is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>Intermediate preprint (revision #1) for submission to ICGT 24 Special Issue in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |

While it conventionally relies on meticulous feature engineering, deep learning techniques have recently shown a great promise in learning effective player and team representations directly for soccer outcome prediction. However, existing methods often overlook the heterogeneous nature of interactions among players and teams, which is crucial for accurately modeling match dynamics. To address this gap, we propose HIGFormer (Heterogeneous Interaction Graph Transformer), a novel graph-augmented transformer-based deep learning model for soccer outcome prediction. HIGFormer introduces a multi-level interaction framework that captures both fine-grained player dynamics and high-level team interactions. Specifically, it comprises (1) a Player Interaction Network, which encodes player performance through heterogeneous interaction graphs, combining local graph convolutions with a global graph-augmented transformer; (2) a Team Interaction Network, which constructs interaction graphs from a team-to-team perspective to model historical match relationships; and (3) a Match Comparison Transformer, which jointly analyzes both team and player-level information to predict match outcomes. Extensive experiments on the WyScout Open Access Dataset, a large-scale real-world soccer dataset, demonstrate that HIGFormer significantly outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we provide valuable insights into leveraging our model for player performance evaluation, offering a new perspective on talent scouting and team strategy analysis.</p></details> |  |

To model the transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete spaces for reaction prediction.</p></details> | 22pages, 2 figures |

We prepend a lightweight Riemannian mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold, mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure. These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space. Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured. Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making graph representations more interpretable.</p></details> |  |

However, training deep learning models for AMS designs is severely limited by the scarcity of integrated circuit design data. In this work, we present CircuitGPS, a few-shot learning method for parasitic effect prediction in AMS circuits. The circuit netlist is represented as a heterogeneous graph, with the coupling capacitance modeled as a link. CircuitGPS is pre-trained on link prediction and fine-tuned on edge regression. The proposed method starts with a small-hop sampling technique that converts a link or a node into a subgraph. Then, the subgraph embeddings are learned with a hybrid graph Transformer. Additionally, CircuitGPS integrates a low-cost positional encoding that summarizes the positional and structural information of the sampled subgraph. CircuitGPS improves the accuracy of coupling existence by at least 20\% and reduces the MAE of capacitance estimation by at least 0.067 compared to existing methods. Our method demonstrates strong inherent scalability, enabling direct application to diverse AMS circuit designs through zero-shot learning.

Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork) framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2) spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries. Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[NTSFormer: A Self-Teaching Graph Transformer for Multimodal Cold-Start Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04870v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because cold-start nodes are isolated (i.e., no edges) and often have missing modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However, this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student" prediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature data into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion. Experimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior performance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphGSOcc: Semantic-Geometric Graph Transformer with Dynamic-Static Decoupling for 3D Gaussian Splatting-based Occupancy Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14825v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among similar categories and across regions, (2) boundary ambiguities caused by the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization and (3) biased issues in dynamic-static object coupling optimization. We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer and decouples dynamic-static objects optimization for 3D Gaussian Splatting-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarsegrained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. On the other hand, we decouple dynamic and static objects by leveraging semantic probability distributions and design a Dynamic-Static Decoupled Gaussian Attention mechanism to optimize the prediction performance for both dynamic objects and static scenes. GraphGSOcc achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, OpenOcc and KITTI occupancy benchmarks. Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 25.20%, reducing GPU memory to 6.8 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple Approximations for General Spanner Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23638v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider a graph with n nodes and m edges, independent edge weights and lengths, and arbitrary distance demands for node pairs. The spanner problem asks for a minimum-weight subgraph that satisfies these demands via sufficiently short paths w.r.t. the edge lengths. For multiplicative alpha-spanners (where demands equal alpha times the original distances) and assuming that each edge's weight equals its length, the simple Greedy heuristic by Alth\"ofer et al. (1993) is known to yield strong solutions, both in theory and practice. To obtain guarantees in more general settings, recent approximations typically abandon this simplicity and practicality. Still, so far, there is no known non-trivial approximation algorithm for the spanner problem in its most general form. We provide two surprisingly simple approximations algorithms. In general, our Augmented Greedy achieves the first unconditional approximation ratio of m, which is non-trivial due to the independence of weights and lengths. Crucially, it maintains all size and weight guarantees Greedy is known for, i.e., in the aforementioned multiplicative alpha-spanner scenario and even for additive +beta-spanners. Further, it generalizes some of these size guarantees to derive new weight guarantees. Our second approach, Randomized Rounding, establishes a graph transformation that allows a simple rounding scheme over a standard multicommodity flow LP. It yields an O(n log n)-approximation, assuming integer lengths and polynomially bounded distance demands. The only other known approximation guarantee in this general setting requires several complex subalgorithms and analyses, yet we match it up to a factor of O(n^{1/5-eps}) using standard tools. Further, on bounded-degree graphs, we yield the first O(log n) approximation ratio for constant-bounded distance demands (beyond multiplicative 2-spanners in unit-length graphs).</p></details> |  |
| **[FoGE: Fock Space inspired encoding for graph prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02937v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based structures effortlessly.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study of Dynamic Stock Relationship Modeling and S&P500 Price Forecasting Based on Differential Graph Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18717v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock price prediction is vital for investment decisions and risk management, yet remains challenging due to markets' nonlinear dynamics and time-varying inter-stock correlations. Traditional static-correlation models fail to capture evolving stock relationships. To address this, we propose a Differential Graph Transformer (DGT) framework for dynamic relationship modeling and price prediction. Our DGT integrates sequential graph structure changes into multi-head self-attention via a differential graph mechanism, adaptively preserving high-value connections while suppressing noise. Causal temporal attention captures global/local dependencies in price sequences. We further evaluate correlation metrics (Pearson, Mutual Information, Spearman, Kendall's Tau) across global/local/dual scopes as spatial-attention priors. Using 10 years of S&P 500 closing prices (z-score normalized; 64-day sliding windows), DGT with spatial priors outperformed GRU baselines (RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87). Kendall's Tau global matrices yielded optimal results (MAE: 0.11). K-means clustering revealed "high-volatility growth" and "defensive blue-chip" stocks, with the latter showing lower errors (RMSE: 0.13) due to stable correlations. Kendall's Tau and Mutual Information excelled in volatile sectors. This study innovatively combines differential graph structures with Transformers, validating dynamic relationship modeling and identifying optimal correlation metrics/scopes. Clustering analysis supports tailored quantitative strategies. Our framework advances financial time-series prediction through dynamic modeling and cross-asset interaction analysis.</p></details> |  |

We introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight, parameter-efficient foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being pre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong multimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a unified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models structural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph transformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful, modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification, prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our model revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a unique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration). BrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can surpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and powerful research in computational neuroscience.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Supercharging Graph Transformers with Advective Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06417v4)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capability of generalization is a cornerstone for the success of modern learning systems. For non-Euclidean data, e.g., graphs, that particularly involves topological structures, one important aspect neglected by prior studies is how machine learning models generalize under topological shifts. This paper proposes Advective Diffusion Transformer (AdvDIFFormer), a physics-inspired graph Transformer model designed to address this challenge. The model is derived from advective diffusion equations which describe a class of continuous message passing process with observed and latent topological structures. We show that AdvDIFFormer has provable capability for controlling generalization error with topological shifts, which in contrast cannot be guaranteed by graph diffusion models, i.e., the generalized formulation of common graph neural networks in continuous space. Empirically, the model demonstrates superiority in various predictive tasks across information networks, molecular screening and protein interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient Few-shot Graph Neural Architecture Search via Partitioning Gradient Contribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01231v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the weight coupling problem, certain studies introduced few-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, which partition the supernet into multiple sub-supernets. However, these methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules. Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Representation Learning with Mutual Influence of Modalities for Node Classification in Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07895v3)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities. Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal data, especially when accompanied with network structures.</p></details> |  |

We propose Pieceformer, a scalable, self-supervised similarity assessment framework, equipped with a hybrid message-passing and graph transformer encoder. To address transformer scalability, we incorporate a linear transformer backbone and introduce a partitioned training pipeline for efficient memory and parallelism management. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world CircuitNet datasets show that Pieceformer reduces mean absolute error (MAE) by 24.9% over the baseline and is the only method to correctly cluster all real-world design groups. We further demonstrate the practical usage of our model through a case study on a partitioning task, achieving up to 89% runtime reduction. These results validate the framework's effectiveness for scalable, unbiased design reuse in modern VLSI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, submitted</p></details> |

GITO consists of two main modules: a hybrid graph transformer (HGT) and a transformer neural operator (TNO). HGT leverages a graph neural network (GNN) to encode local spatial relationships and a transformer to capture long-range dependencies. A self-attention fusion layer integrates the outputs of the GNN and transformer to enable more expressive feature learning on graph-structured data. TNO module employs linear-complexity cross-attention and self-attention layers to map encoded input functions to predictions at arbitrary query locations, ensuring discretization invariance and enabling zero-shot super-resolution across any mesh. Empirical results on benchmark PDE tasks demonstrate that GITO outperforms existing transformer-based neural operators, paving the way for efficient, mesh-agnostic surrogate solvers in engineering applications.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that, by effectively encoding ego-graphs (1-hop neighbourhoods), we can reduce the reliance on resource-intensive textual encoders. This makes the model both fast at training and inference time, as well as frugal in terms of cost. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on three popular datasets and show that FnF-TG can achieve superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. We also extend inductive learning to a fully inductive setting, where relations don't rely on transductive (fixed) representations, as in previous work, but are a function of their textual description. Additionally, we introduce new variants of existing datasets, specifically designed to test the performance of models on unseen relations at inference time, thus offering a new test-bench for fully inductive link prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[H$^2$GFM: Towards unifying Homogeneity and Heterogeneity on Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08298v2)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing interests and applications of graph learning in diverse domains have propelled the development of a unified model generalizing well across different graphs and tasks, known as the Graph Foundation Model (GFM). Existing research has leveraged text-attributed graphs (TAGs) to tackle the heterogeneity in node features among graphs. However, they primarily focus on homogeneous TAGs (HoTAGs), leaving heterogeneous TAGs (HeTAGs), where multiple types of nodes/edges reside, underexplored. To enhance the capabilities and applications of GFM, we introduce H$^2$GFM, a novel framework designed to generalize across both HoTAGs and HeTAGs. Our model projects diverse meta-relations among graphs under a unified textual space, and employs a context encoding to capture spatial and higher-order semantic relationships. To achieve robust node representations, we propose a novel context-adaptive graph transformer (CGT), effectively capturing information from both context neighbors and their relationships. Furthermore, we employ a mixture of CGT experts to capture the heterogeneity in structural patterns among graph types. Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of HoTAGs and HeTAGs as well as learning scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Efficient and Generalizable Graph Retriever for Knowledge-Graph Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09645v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong inductive reasoning ability across various domains, but their reliability is hindered by the outdated knowledge and hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these issues by grounding LLMs with external knowledge; however, most existing RAG pipelines rely on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and structured reasoning. Knowledge graphs, which represent facts as relational triples, offer a more structured and compact alternative. Recent studies have explored integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), with a significant proportion adopting the retrieve-then-reasoning paradigm. In this framework, graph-based retrievers have demonstrated strong empirical performance, yet they still face challenges in generalization ability. In this work, we propose RAPL, a novel framework for efficient and effective graph retrieval in KGQA. RAPL addresses these limitations through three aspects: (1) a two-stage labeling strategy that combines heuristic signals with parametric models to provide causally grounded supervision; (2) a model-agnostic graph transformation approach to capture both intra- and inter-triple interactions, thereby enhancing representational capacity; and (3) a path-based reasoning strategy that facilitates learning from the injected rational knowledge, and supports downstream reasoner through structured inputs. Empirically, RAPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by $2.66\%-20.34\%$, and significantly reduces the performance gap between smaller and more powerful LLM-based reasoners, as well as the gap under cross-dataset settings, highlighting its superior retrieval capability and generalizability.

| **[Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding for Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08309v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However, the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies. Also, L-STEP obtains the leading performance in the newest large-scale TGB benchmark.

| **[HGFormer: A Hierarchical Graph Transformer Framework for Two-Stage Colonel Blotto Games via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08580v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-stage Colonel Blotto game represents a typical adversarial resource allocation problem, in which two opposing agents sequentially allocate resources in a network topology across two phases: an initial resource deployment followed by multiple rounds of dynamic reallocation adjustments. The sequential dependency between game stages and the complex constraints imposed by the graph topology make it difficult for traditional approaches to attain a globally optimal strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical graph Transformer framework called HGformer. By incorporating an enhanced graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent hierarchical decision model, our approach enables efficient policy generation in large-scale adversarial environments. Moreover, we design a layer-by-layer feedback reinforcement learning algorithm that feeds the long-term returns from lower-level decisions back into the optimization of the higher-level strategy, thus bridging the coordination gap between the two decision-making stages. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing hierarchical decision-making or graph neural network methods, HGformer significantly improves resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, achieving superior overall performance in complex dynamic game scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We present the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a hybrid graph-based architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention mechanism into the message-passing framework for structured language modeling. The attention mechanism is implemented using parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), which enable the model to capture rich contextual relationships while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to classical attention mechanisms. We evaluate QGT on five sentiment classification benchmarks. Experimental results show that QGT consistently achieves higher or comparable accuracy than existing quantum natural language processing (QNLP) models, including both attention-based and non-attention-based approaches. When compared with an equivalent classical graph transformer, QGT yields an average accuracy improvement of 5.42% on real-world datasets and 4.76% on synthetic datasets. Additionally, QGT demonstrates improved sample efficiency, requiring nearly 50% fewer labeled samples to reach comparable performance on the Yelp dataset. These results highlight the potential of graph-based QNLP techniques for advancing efficient and scalable language understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Return of ChebNet: Understanding and Improving an Overlooked GNN on Long Range Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07624v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ChebNet, one of the earliest spectral GNNs, has largely been overshadowed by Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), which gained popularity for their simplicity and effectiveness in capturing local graph structure. Despite their success, MPNNs are limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies between nodes. This has led researchers to adapt MPNNs through rewiring or make use of Graph Transformers, which compromises the computational efficiency that characterized early spatial message-passing architectures, and typically disregards the graph structure. Almost a decade after its original introduction, we revisit ChebNet to shed light on its ability to model distant node interactions. We find that out-of-box, ChebNet already shows competitive advantages relative to classical MPNNs and GTs on long-range benchmarks, while maintaining good scalability properties for high-order polynomials. However, we uncover that this polynomial expansion leads ChebNet to an unstable regime during training. To address this limitation, we cast ChebNet as a stable and non-dissipative dynamical system, which we coin Stable-ChebNet. Our Stable-ChebNet model allows for stable information propagation, and has controllable dynamics which do not require the use of eigendecompositions, positional encodings, or graph rewiring. Across several benchmarks, Stable-ChebNet achieves near state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

First, we propose GET, which combines a standard transformer encoder or decoder architecture with an innovative graph-to-sequence transformation method. This method converts graphs or sampled subgraphs into sequences of tokens representing nodes, edges, and attributes in a reversible manner using Eulerian paths. We pre-train GET using either of the two self-supervised tasks: next-token prediction (NTP) and scheduled masked-token prediction (SMTP). The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as graph-, edge-, and node-level prediction. Despite its simplicity, GraphGPT achieves performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods on multiple large-scale Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets. It demonstrates exceptional results on the molecular property prediction dataset PCQM4Mv2 and the protein-protein interaction dataset ogbl-ppa. Notably, generative pre-training enables scaling GraphGPT to 2 billion parameters while maintaining performance gains - a breakthrough that overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and prior graph transformers (GTs). To advance research in graph foundation models and facilitate scientific discovery in chemistry, materials science, and related fields, we will release the source code (https://github.com/alibaba/graph-gpt) and pre-trained checkpoints.</p></details> | 9 pages |

By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel. Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training and evaluating existing GTs.

Usually, action coordination is represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA) module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these Transformer-based DGNNs vary significantly, highlighting the importance of properly defining the SAM on dynamic graphs and comprehensively encoding temporal and interactive dynamics without extra complex modules. In this work, we propose TIDFormer, a dynamic graph TransFormer that fully exploits Temporal and Interactive Dynamics in an efficient manner. We clarify and verify the interpretability of our proposed SAM, addressing the open problem of its uninterpretable definitions on dynamic graphs in previous works. To model the temporal and interactive dynamics, respectively, we utilize the calendar-based time partitioning information and extract informative interaction embeddings for both bipartite and non-bipartite graphs using merely the sampled first-order neighbors. In addition, we jointly model temporal and interactive features by capturing potential changes in historical interaction patterns through a simple decomposition. We conduct extensive experiments on several dynamic graph datasets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of TIDFormer. The experimental results demonstrate that TIDFormer excels, outperforming state-of-the-art models across most datasets and experimental settings. Furthermore, TIDFormer exhibits significant efficiency advantages compared to previous Transformer-based methods.</p></details> | KDD2025 |
| **[Simple Path Structural Encoding for Graph Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09365v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph transformers extend global self-attention to graph-structured data, achieving notable success in graph learning. Recently, random walk structural encoding (RWSE) has been found to further enhance their predictive power by encoding both structural and positional information into the edge representation. However, RWSE cannot always distinguish between edges that belong to different local graph patterns, which reduces its ability to capture the full structural complexity of graphs. This work introduces Simple Path Structural Encoding (SPSE), a novel method that utilizes simple path counts for edge encoding. We show theoretically and experimentally that SPSE overcomes the limitations of RWSE, providing a richer representation of graph structures, particularly for capturing local cyclic patterns. To make SPSE computationally tractable, we propose an efficient approximate algorithm for simple path counting. SPSE demonstrates significant performance improvements over RWSE on various benchmarks, including molecular and long-range graph datasets, achieving statistically significant gains in discriminative tasks. These results pose SPSE as a powerful edge encoding alternative for enhancing the expressivity of graph transformers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Classic GNNs Be Strong Baselines for Graph-level Tasks? Simple Architectures Meet Excellence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09263v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often criticized for their limited expressiveness, issues like over-smoothing and over-squashing, and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies. Conversely, Graph Transformers (GTs) are regarded as superior due to their employment of global attention mechanisms, which potentially mitigate these challenges. Literature frequently suggests that GTs outperform GNNs in graph-level tasks, especially for graph classification and regression on small molecular graphs. In this study, we explore the untapped potential of GNNs through an enhanced framework, GNN+, which integrates six widely used techniques: edge feature integration, normalization, dropout, residual connections, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding, to effectively tackle graph-level tasks. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of three classic GNNs (GCN, GIN, and GatedGCN) enhanced by the GNN+ framework across 14 well-known graph-level datasets. Our results reveal that, contrary to prevailing beliefs, these classic GNNs consistently match or surpass the performance of GTs, securing top-three rankings across all datasets and achieving first place in eight. Furthermore, they demonstrate greater efficiency, running several times faster than GTs on many datasets. This highlights the potential of simple GNN architectures, challenging the notion that complex mechanisms in GTs are essential for superior graph-level performance.

However, integrating the vital structural information of KGs into Large Language Models (LLMs) and outputting predictions deterministically remains challenging. To address this, we propose a new method called GLTW, which encodes the structural information of KGs and merges it with LLMs to enhance KGC performance. Specifically, we introduce an improved Graph Transformer (iGT) that effectively encodes subgraphs with both local and global structural information and inherits the characteristics of language model, bypassing training from scratch. Also, we develop a subgraph-based multi-classification training objective, using all entities within KG as classification objects, to boost learning efficiency.Importantly, we combine iGT with an LLM that takes KG language prompts as input.Our extensive experiments on various KG datasets show that GLTW achieves significant performance gains compared to SOTA baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025(Findings)</p></details> |

We address the task of extracting clinical events and their temporal relations using the well-studied I2B2 2012 Temporal Relations Challenge corpus. This task is inherently challenging due to complex clinical language, long documents, and sparse annotations. We introduce GRAPHTREX, a novel method integrating span-based entity-relation extraction, clinical large pre-trained language models (LPLMs), and Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) to capture local and global dependencies. Our HGT component facilitates information propagation across the document through innovative global landmarks that bridge distant entities. Our method improves the state-of-the-art with 5.5% improvement in the tempeval $F_1$ score over the previous best and up to 8.9% improvement on long-range relations, which presents a formidable challenge. We further demonstrate generalizability by establishing a strong baseline on the E3C corpus. This work not only advances temporal information extraction but also lays the groundwork for improved diagnostic and prognostic models through enhanced temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Intro...</summary><p>Introducing a novel method for joint extraction of medical events and temporal relations from free-text, leveraging clinical LPLMs and Heterogeneous Graph Transformers, achieving a 5.5% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art and up to 8.9% on long-range relations</p></details> |
| **[GrokFormer: Graph Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17296v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in graph representation learning over popular graph neural networks (GNNs). However, self--attention, the core module of GTs, preserves only low-frequency signals in graph features, leading to ineffectiveness in capturing other important signals like high-frequency ones. Some recent GT models help alleviate this issue, but their flexibility and expressiveness are still limited since the filters they learn are fixed on predefined graph spectrum or spectral order. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Graph Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (GrokFormer), a novel GT model that learns highly expressive spectral filters with adaptive graph spectrum and spectral order through a Fourier series modeling over learnable activation functions. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the proposed GrokFormer filter offers better expressiveness than other spectral methods. Comprehensive experiments on 10 real-world node classification datasets across various domains, scales, and graph properties, as well as 5 graph classification datasets, show that GrokFormer outperforms state-of-the-art GTs and GNNs.

This position paper argues that message-passing GNNs are fundamentally incapable of approximating sparse triangular factorizations. We demonstrate that message-passing GNNs fundamentally fail to approximate sparse triangular factorizations for classes of matrices for which high-quality preconditioners exist but require non-local dependencies. To illustrate this, we construct a set of baselines using both synthetic matrices and real-world examples from the SuiteSparse collection. Across a range of GNN architectures, including Graph Attention Networks and Graph Transformers, we observe severe performance degradation compared to exact or K-optimal factorizations, with cosine similarity dropping below $0.6$ in key cases. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest that architectural innovations beyond message-passing are necessary for applying GNNs to scientific computing tasks such as matrix factorization. Experiments demonstrate that overcoming non-locality alone is insufficient. Tailored architectures are necessary to capture the required dependencies since even a completely non-local Graph Transformer fails to match the proposed baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[EGGs are adhesive!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13678v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of rewriting-based visual formalisms is on the rise. In the formal methods community, this is due also to the introduction of adhesive categories, where most properties of classical approaches to graph transformation, such as those on parallelism and confluence, can be rephrased and proved in a general and uniform way.E-graphs (EGGs) are a formalism for program optimisation via an efficient implementation of equality saturation. In short, EGGs can be defined as (acyclic) term graphs with an additional notion of equivalence on nodes that is closed under the operators of the signature. Instead of replacing the components of a program, the optimisation step is performed by adding new components and linking them to the existing ones via an equivalence relation, until an optimal program is reached. This work describes EGGs via adhesive categories. Besides the benefits in itself of a formal presentation, which renders the properties of the data structure precise, the description of the addition of equivalent program components using standard graph transformation tools offers the advantages of the adhesive framework in modelling, for example, concurrent updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Graph Prompt Work? A Data Operation Perspective with Theoretical Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01635v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph prompting has emerged as a promising research direction, enabling the learning of additional tokens or subgraphs appended to the original graphs without requiring retraining of pre-trained graph models across various applications. This novel paradigm, shifting from the traditional pretraining and finetuning to pretraining and prompting has shown significant empirical success in simulating graph data operations, with applications ranging from recommendation systems to biological networks and graph transferring. However, despite its potential, the theoretical underpinnings of graph prompting remain underexplored, raising critical questions about its fundamental effectiveness. The lack of rigorous theoretical proof of why and how much it works is more like a dark cloud over the graph prompt area to go further. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework that rigorously analyzes graph prompting from a data operation perspective. Our contributions are threefold: First, we provide a formal guarantee theorem, demonstrating graph prompts capacity to approximate graph transformation operators, effectively linking upstream and downstream tasks. Second, we derive upper bounds on the error of these data operations by graph prompts for a single graph and extend this discussion to batches of graphs, which are common in graph model training. Third, we analyze the distribution of data operation errors, extending our theoretical findings from linear graph models (e.g., GCN) to non-linear graph models (e.g., GAT). Extensive experiments support our theoretical results and confirm the practical implications of these guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Target Specific De Novo Design of Drug Candidate Molecules with Graph Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07868v7)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering novel drug candidate molecules is one of the most fundamental and critical steps in drug development. Generative deep learning models, which create synthetic data given a probability distribution, offer a high potential for designing de novo molecules. However, to be utilisable in real life drug development pipelines, these models should be able to design drug like and target centric molecules. In this study, we propose an end to end generative system, DrugGEN, for the de novo design of drug candidate molecules that interact with intended target proteins. The proposed method represents molecules as graphs and processes them via a generative adversarial network comprising graph transformer layers. The system is trained using a large dataset of drug like compounds and target specific bioactive molecules to design effective inhibitory molecules against the AKT1 protein, which is critically important in developing treatments for various types of cancer. We conducted molecular docking and dynamics to assess the target centric generation performance of the model, as well as attention score visualisation to examine model interpretability. In parallel, selected compounds were chemically synthesised and evaluated in the context of in vitro enzymatic assays, which identified two bioactive molecules that inhibited AKT1 at low micromolar concentrations. These results indicate that DrugGEN's de novo molecules have a high potential for interacting with the AKT1 protein at the level of its native ligands. Using the open access DrugGEN codebase, it is possible to easily train models for other druggable proteins, given a dataset of experimentally known bioactive molecules.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAM-GT: Dual Positional Encoding-Based Attention Masking Graph Transformer for Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17660v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neighborhood-aware tokenized graph Transformers have recently shown great potential for node classification tasks. Despite their effectiveness, our in-depth analysis of neighborhood tokens reveals two critical limitations in the existing paradigm. First, current neighborhood token generation methods fail to adequately capture attribute correlations within a neighborhood. Second, the conventional self-attention mechanism suffers from attention diversion when processing neighborhood tokens, where high-hop neighborhoods receive disproportionate focus, severely disrupting information interactions between the target node and its neighborhood tokens. To address these challenges, we propose DAM-GT, Dual positional encoding-based Attention Masking graph Transformer. DAM-GT introduces a novel dual positional encoding scheme that incorporates attribute-aware encoding via an attribute clustering strategy, effectively preserving node correlations in both topological and attribute spaces. In addition, DAM-GT formulates a new attention mechanism with a simple yet effective masking strategy to guide interactions between target nodes and their neighborhood tokens, overcoming the issue of attention diversion. Extensive experiments on various graphs with different homophily levels as well as different scales demonstrate that DAM-GT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification tasks.</p></details> | Preprint version |

In recent years, deep learning architectures have been introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of various TS- to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d) demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the required training data compared to the baseline methods.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Plain Transformers Can be Powerful Graph Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12588v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities, owing to their simple but powerful scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph Transformers (GTs) have strayed far from plain Transformers, exhibiting major architectural differences either by integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention mechanisms. These divergences hinder the easy adoption of training advances for Transformers developed in other domains. Contrary to previous GTs, this work demonstrates that the plain Transformer architecture can be a powerful graph learner. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate three simple, minimal, and easy-to-implement modifications to the plain Transformer architecture to construct our Powerful Plain Graph Transformers (PPGT): (1) simplified $L_2$ attention for measuring the magnitude closeness among tokens; (2) adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude information; and (3) a simple MLP-based stem for graph positional encoding. Consistent with its theoretical expressivity, PPGT demonstrates noteworthy realized expressivity on the empirical graph expressivity benchmark, comparing favorably to more complicated competitors such as subgraph GNNs and higher-order GNNs. Its outstanding empirical performance across various graph datasets also justifies the practical effectiveness of PPGT.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models face significant challenges in scaling to large circuits due to limitations like over-squashing in graph neural networks and the quadratic complexity of transformer-based models. To address these issues, we introduce DeepGate4, a scalable and efficient graph transformer specifically designed for large-scale circuits. DeepGate4 incorporates several key innovations: (1) an update strategy tailored for circuit graphs, which reduce memory complexity to sub-linear and is adaptable to any graph transformer; (2) a GAT-based sparse transformer with global and local structural encodings for AIGs; and (3) an inference acceleration CUDA kernel that fully exploit the unique sparsity patterns of AIGs. Our extensive experiments on the ITC99 and EPFL benchmarks show that DeepGate4 significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15.5% and 31.1% performance improvements over the next-best models. Furthermore, the Fused-DeepGate4 variant reduces runtime by 35.1% and memory usage by 46.8%, making it highly efficient for large-scale circuit analysis. These results demonstrate the potential of DeepGate4 to handle complex EDA tasks while offering superior scalability and efficiency.

By streaming covariance-spectrum statistics such as entropy, eigenvalue gaps, and KL divergence from random baselines into a lightweight recurrent classifier, EigenTrack tracks temporal shifts in representation structure that signal hallucination and OOD drift before surface errors appear. Unlike black- and grey-box methods, it needs only a single forward pass without resampling. Unlike existing white-box detectors, it preserves temporal context, aggregates global signals, and offers interpretable accuracy-latency trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, submitted to ICASSP 2026, September 2025</p></details> |

Strategic Classification (SC) has emerged as a framework for studying this interaction between agents and decision-makers to design more trustworthy ML systems. Prior theoretical models in SC assume that agents are perfectly or approximately rational and respond to decision policies by optimizing their utility. However, the growing prevalence of LLMs raises the possibility that real-world agents may instead rely on these tools for strategic advice. This shift prompts two questions: (i) Can LLMs generate effective and socially responsible strategies in SC settings? (ii) Can existing SC theoretical models accurately capture agent behavior when agents follow LLM-generated advice? To investigate these questions, we examine five critical SC scenarios: hiring, loan applications, school admissions, personal income, and public assistance programs. We simulate agents with diverse profiles who interact with three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5), following their suggestions on effort allocations on features. We compare the resulting agent behaviors with the best responses in existing SC models. Our findings show that: (i) Even without access to the decision policy, LLMs can generate effective strategies that improve both agents' scores and qualification; (ii) At the population level, LLM-guided effort allocation strategies yield similar or even higher score improvements, qualification rates, and fairness metrics as those predicted by the SC theoretical model, suggesting that the theoretical model may still serve as a reasonable proxy for LLM-influenced behavior; and (iii) At the individual level, LLMs tend to produce more diverse and balanced effort allocations than theoretical models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Add G...</summary><p>Add GPT 5 experiments</p></details> |

Such loops were shown to lead to distribution shifts - models misrepresenting the true underlying distributions of human data (also called model collapse). However, how human data properties affect such shifts remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first empirical examination of the effect of such properties on the outcome of recursive training. We first confirm that using different human datasets leads to distribution shifts of different magnitudes. Through exhaustive manipulation of dataset properties combined with regression analyses, we then identify a set of properties predicting distribution shift magnitudes. Lexical diversity is found to amplify these shifts, while semantic diversity and data quality mitigate them. Furthermore, we find that these influences are highly modular: data scrapped from a given internet domain has little influence on the content generated for another domain. Finally, experiments on political bias reveal that human data properties affect whether the initial bias will be amplified or reduced. Overall, our results portray a novel view, where different parts of internet may undergo different types of distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

We study the applicability of LLMs for localizing such hallucinations, as a more practical alternative to existing complex evaluation pipelines. In the absence of established benchmarks for meta-evaluation of hallucinations localization, we construct one tailored to LLMs, involving a challenging human annotation of over 1,000 examples. We complement the benchmark with an LLM-based evaluation protocol, verifying its quality in a human evaluation. Since existing representations of hallucinations limit the types of errors that can be expressed, we propose a new representation based on free-form textual descriptions, capturing the full range of possible errors. We conduct a comprehensive study, evaluating four large-scale LLMs, which highlights the benchmark's difficulty, as the best model achieves an F1 score of only 0.67. Through careful analysis, we offer insights into optimal prompting strategies for the task and identify the main factors that make it challenging for LLMs: (1) a tendency to incorrectly flag missing details as inconsistent, despite being instructed to check only facts in the output; and (2) difficulty with outputs containing factually correct information absent from the source - and thus not verifiable - due to alignment with the model's parametric knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[EPO: Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization for LLM Agents Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22576v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode, presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed, low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse, where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search (DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Activation steering offers a promising method to control the generation process of LLMs by modifying their internal activations. However, existing methods commonly intervene in the model's behaviour using steering vectors generated by the model itself, which constrains their effectiveness to that specific model and excludes the possibility of leveraging powerful external expert models for steering. To address these limitations, we propose ExpertSteer, a novel approach that leverages arbitrary specialized expert models to generate steering vectors, enabling intervention in any LLMs. ExpertSteer transfers the knowledge from an expert model to a target LLM through a cohesive four-step process: first aligning representation dimensions with auto-encoders to enable cross-model transfer, then identifying intervention layer pairs based on mutual information analysis, next generating steering vectors from the expert model using Recursive Feature Machines, and finally applying these vectors on the identified layers during inference to selectively guide the target LLM without updating model parameters. We conduct comprehensive experiments using three LLMs on 15 popular benchmarks across four distinct domains. Experiments demonstrate that ExpertSteer significantly outperforms established baselines across diverse tasks at minimal cost.</p></details> |  |

In order to address this, we present a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code.

While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation.

A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent is tasked with a single or multi-object rearrangement task using an under-specified instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines including GPT-4o as well as supervised fine-tuned MLLMs on our task. Our results show that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin (10.4-16.5%), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[We Think, Therefore We Align LLMs to Helpful, Harmless and Honest Before They Go Wrong](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22510v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) along multiple objectives-helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH)-is critical for safe and reliable deployment. Prior work has used steering vector-small control signals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via one-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single alignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for other objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches extend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While this alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize each objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs across HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch Steering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient multi-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the Transformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage II, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a policy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while maintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca, BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment across multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared to a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representing LLMs in Prompt Semantic Task Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22506v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results over various tasks, and ever-expanding public repositories contain an abundance of pre-trained models. Therefore, identifying the best-performing LLM for a given task is a significant challenge. Previous works have suggested learning LLM representations to address this. However, these approaches present limited scalability and require costly retraining to encompass additional models and datasets. Moreover, the produced representation utilizes distinct spaces that cannot be easily interpreted. This work presents an efficient, training-free approach to representing LLMs as linear operators within the prompts' semantic task space, thus providing a highly interpretable representation of the models' application. Our method utilizes closed-form computation of geometrical properties and ensures exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to dynamically expanding repositories. We demonstrate our approach on success prediction and model selection tasks, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art results with notable performance in out-of-sample scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs over explicit discrete probability distributions. Given observations from a probability distribution, we evaluate models on three carefully designed tasks, mode identification, maximum likelihood estimation, and sample generation, by prompting them to provide responses to queries about either the joint distribution or its conditionals. These tasks thus probe a range of probabilistic skills, including frequency analysis, marginalization, and generative behavior. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that there exists a clear performance gap between smaller and larger models, with the latter demonstrating stronger inference and surprising capabilities in sample generation. Furthermore, our investigations reveal notable limitations, including sensitivity to variations in the notation utilized to represent probabilistic outcomes and performance degradation of over 60% as context length increases. Together, our results provide a detailed understanding of the probabilistic reasoning abilities of LLMs and identify key directions for future improvement.</p></details> | 27 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Beyond Early-Token Bias: Model-Specific and Language-Specific Position Effects in Multilingual LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16134v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit position bias - a systematic tendency to neglect information at specific context positions. However, the patterns of position bias behavior, depending on the language or model, remain unexplored. We present a multilingual study across five typologically distinct languages (English, Russian, German, Hindi, and Vietnamese) and five model architectures, examining how position bias interacts with prompt strategies and affects output entropy. Our key findings are: (1) Position bias is primarily model-driven, yet exhibits language-specific variations. For instance, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and DeepSeek 7B Chat consistently favors late positions, challenging established assumptions of a universal early-token bias in LLMs. (2) Explicitly instructing the model that "the context is relevant to the query" unexpectedly reduces accuracy across languages, undermining common prompt-engineering practices. (3) While the largest accuracy drop occurs when relevant information is placed in the middle of the context, this is not explicitly reflected by a corresponding peak in output entropy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Alleviate Catastrophic Forgetting in Graph Continual Learning? A Systematic Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18697v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, real-world data, including graph-structure data, often arrives in a streaming manner, which means that learning systems need to continuously acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. Although substantial existing works attempt to address catastrophic forgetting in graph machine learning, they are all based on training from scratch with streaming data. With the rise of pretrained models, an increasing number of studies have leveraged their strong generalization ability for continual learning. Therefore, in this work, we attempt to answer whether large language models (LLMs) can mitigate catastrophic forgetting in Graph Continual Learning (GCL). We first point out that current experimental setups for GCL have significant flaws, as the evaluation stage may lead to task ID leakage. Then, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in more realistic scenarios and find that even minor modifications can lead to outstanding results. Finally, based on extensive experiments, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, Simple Graph Continual Learning (SimGCL), that surpasses the previous state-of-the-art GNN-based baseline by around 20% under the rehearsal-free constraint. To facilitate reproducibility, we have developed an easy-to-use benchmark LLM4GCL for training and evaluating existing GCL methods.

This vulnerability is exacerbated in multilingual settings, where multilingual safety-aligned data is often limited. Thus, developing a guardrail capable of detecting and filtering unsafe content across diverse languages is critical for deploying LLMs in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a multilingual guardrail with reasoning for prompt classification. Our method consists of: (1) synthetic multilingual data generation incorporating culturally and linguistically nuanced variants, (2) supervised fine-tuning, and (3) a curriculum-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that further improves performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our multilingual guardrail, MrGuard, consistently outperforms recent baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain languages by more than 15%. We also evaluate MrGuard's robustness to multilingual variations, such as code-switching and low-resource language distractors in the prompt, and demonstrate that it preserves safety judgments under these challenging conditions. The multilingual reasoning capability of our guardrail enables it to generate explanations, which are particularly useful for understanding language-specific risks and ambiguities in multilingual content moderation.</p></details> | Preprint |

We introduce QA-LIGN, which decomposes monolithic rewards into interpretable principle-specific evaluations through structured natural language programs. Models learn through a draft, critique, and revise pipeline, where symbolic evaluation against the rubrics provides transparent feedback for both initial and revised responses during GRPO training. Applied to uncensored Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, QA-LIGN reduces attack success rates by up to 68.7% while maintaining a 0.67% false refusal rate, achieving Pareto optimal safety-helpfulness performance and outperforming both DPO and GRPO with state-of-the-art reward models given equivalent training. These results demonstrate that making reward signals interpretable and modular improves alignment effectiveness, suggesting transparency enhances LLM safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches based on reinforcement learning or large language models (LLMs) exhibit limitations in such scenarios. They struggle to infer unobserved steps and reconstruct the underlying user action sequences to navigate the vast UI interaction space, primarily due to limited goal-directed reasoning and planning. We present TreeMind, a novel technique that integrates LLMs with a customized Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to achieve strategic UI exploration in bug reproduction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to combine external decision-making with LLM semantic reasoning for reliable bug reproduction. We formulate the reproduction task as a target-driven search problem, leveraging MCTS as the core planning mechanism to iteratively refine action sequences. To enhance MCTS with semantic reasoning, we introduce two LLM-guided agents with distinct roles: Expander generates top-k promising actions based on the current UI state and exploration history, while Simulator estimates the likelihood that each action leads toward successful reproduction. By incorporating multi-modal UI inputs and advanced prompting techniques, TreeMind conducts feedback-aware navigation that identifies missing but essential user actions and incrementally reconstructs the reproduction paths. We evaluate TreeMind on a dataset of 93 real-world Android bug reports from three widely-used benchmarks. Experimental results show that it significantly outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in reproduction success rate. A real-world case study indicates that integrating LLM reasoning with MCTS-based planning is a compelling direction for automated bug reproduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs be Good Graph Judge for Knowledge Graph Construction?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17388v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios, most of the data obtained from the information retrieval (IR) system is unstructured. Converting natural language sentences into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) remains a critical challenge. We identified three limitations with respect to existing KG construction methods: (1) There could be a large amount of noise in real-world documents, which could result in extracting messy information. (2) Naive LLMs usually extract inaccurate knowledge from some domain-specific documents. (3) Hallucination phenomenon cannot be overlooked when directly using LLMs to construct KGs. In this paper, we propose \textbf{GraphJudge}, a KG construction framework to address the aforementioned challenges. In this framework, we designed an entity-centric strategy to eliminate the noise information in the documents. And we fine-tuned a LLM as a graph judge to finally enhance the quality of generated KGs. Experiments conducted on two general and one domain-specific text-graph pair datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance against various baseline methods with strong generalization abilities.

A Benchmark for Epistemic Competence in Information-Seeking Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22391v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has explored training Large Language Model (LLM) search agents with reinforcement learning (RL) for open-domain question answering (QA). However, most evaluations focus solely on final answer accuracy, overlooking how these agents reason with and act on external evidence. We introduce SeekBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the \textit{epistemic competence} of LLM search agents through step-level analysis of their response traces. SeekBench comprises 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 response steps generated by LLM search agents, each enriched with evidence annotations for granular analysis of whether agents (1) generate reasoning steps grounded in observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from low-quality results, and (3) have proper calibration to correctly assess whether the current evidence is sufficient for providing an answer.</p></details> |  |

A crucial step toward answering this question is the analysis of training data, whose political content remains largely underexplored in current LLM research. To address this gap, we present in this paper an analysis of the pre- and post-training corpora of OLMO2, the largest fully open-source model released together with its complete dataset. From these corpora, we draw large random samples, automatically annotate documents for political orientation, and analyze their source domains and content. We then assess how political content in the training data correlates with models' stance on specific policy issues. Our analysis shows that left-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora containing significantly more politically engaged content than post-training data. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics through distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant stance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases when evaluated on policy issues. These findings underscore the need to integrate political content analysis into future data curation pipelines as well as in-depth documentation of filtering strategies for transparency.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, under review</p></details> |

We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training, introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 tables, accepted at the International Joint Conference on Learning & Reasoning (IJCLR 2025)</p></details> |

Decentralized training has emerged as a promising paradigm to leverage dispersed resources across clusters, datacenters and regions, offering the potential to democratize LLM development for broader communities. As the first comprehensive exploration of this emerging field, we present decentralized LLM training as a resource-driven paradigm and categorize existing efforts into community-driven and organizational approaches. We further clarify this through: (1) a comparison with related paradigms, (2) a characterization of decentralized resources, and (3) a taxonomy of recent advancements. We also provide up-to-date case studies and outline future directions to advance research in decentralized LLM training.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise, contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions, activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their representational structure is consistent across model families and scales. These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct, independently steerable representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Textual Context: Structural Graph Encoding with Adaptive Space Alignment to alleviate the hallucination of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22251v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then, the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available at https://github.com/yfangZhang/SSKG-LLM.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing safety methods rely on ad-hoc taxonomy and lack a rigorous, systematic protection, failing to ensure safety for the nuanced and complex behaviors of modern LLM systems. To address this problem, we solve LLM safety from legal compliance perspectives, named safety compliance. In this work, we posit relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization (GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.</p></details> |  |

While these capabilities offer exciting opportunities, they also raise critical concerns about fairness and reliability. In this paper, we investigate bias in LLM-generated peer reviews by conducting controlled experiments on sensitive metadata, including author affiliation and gender. Our analysis consistently shows affiliation bias favoring institutions highly ranked on common academic rankings. Additionally, we find some gender preferences, which, even though subtle in magnitude, have the potential to compound over time.

However, benchmarking and modeling these models remains a fundamental challenge. We introduce FLEXI, the first benchmark for full-duplex LLM-human spoken interaction that explicitly incorporates model interruption in emergency scenarios. FLEXI systematically evaluates the latency, quality, and conversational effectiveness of real-time dialogue through six diverse human-LLM interaction scenarios, revealing significant gaps between open source and commercial models in emergency awareness, turn terminating, and interaction latency. Finally, we suggest that next token-pair prediction offers a promising path toward achieving truly seamless and human-like full-duplex interaction.</p></details> |  |

A widely held "cascading failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought (ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware correction mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

While these models offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data, resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks, particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels. RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source corpus.</p></details> |  |

Such library hallucinations are not just benign errors: they can mislead developers, break builds, and expose systems to supply chain threats such as slopsquatting. Despite increasing awareness of these risks, little is known about how real-world prompt variations affect hallucination rates. Therefore, we present the first systematic study of how user-level prompt variations impact library hallucinations in LLM-generated code. We evaluate six diverse LLMs across two hallucination types: library name hallucinations (invalid imports) and library member hallucinations (invalid calls from valid libraries). We investigate how realistic user language extracted from developer forums and how user errors of varying degrees (one- or multi-character misspellings and completely fake names/members) affect LLM hallucination rates. Our findings reveal systemic vulnerabilities: one-character misspellings in library names trigger hallucinations in up to 26% of tasks, fake library names are accepted in up to 99% of tasks, and time-related prompts lead to hallucinations in up to 84% of tasks. Prompt engineering shows promise for mitigating hallucinations, but remains inconsistent and LLM-dependent. Our results underscore the fragility of LLMs to natural prompt variation and highlight the urgent need for safeguards against library-related hallucinations and their potential exploitation.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 tables |

However, most of this research is conducted within a monolingual setting, primarily focusing on English. Few studies have attempted to explore the internal workings of LLMs in multilingual settings. In this study, we aim to fill this research gap by examining how neuron activation is shared across tasks and languages. We classify neurons into four distinct categories based on their responses to a specific input across different languages: all-shared, partial-shared, specific, and non-activated. Building upon this categorisation, we conduct extensive experiments on three tasks across nine languages using several LLMs and present an in-depth analysis in this work. Our findings reveal that: (i) deactivating the all-shared neurons significantly decreases performance; (ii) the shared neurons play a vital role in generating responses, especially for the all-shared neurons; (iii) neuron activation patterns are highly sensitive and vary across tasks, LLMs, and languages. These findings shed light on the internal workings of multilingual LLMs and pave the way for future research. We release the code to foster research in this area.</p></details> |  |

We reformat constituency parsing as a sequence-to-sequence generation problem and evaluate the performance of a diverse range of LLMs under zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised fine-tuning learning paradigms. We observe that while LLMs achieve acceptable improvements, they still encounter substantial limitations, due to the absence of mechanisms to guarantee the validity and faithfulness of the generated constituent trees. Motivated by this observation, we propose two strategies to guide LLMs to generate more accurate constituent trees by learning from erroneous samples and refining outputs in a multi-agent collaboration way, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods effectively reduce the occurrence of invalid and unfaithful trees, thereby enhancing overall parsing performance and achieving promising results across different learning paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing (TASLP).

| **[Leveraging LLM Agents for Automated Video Game Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22170v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games) is a critical yet labor-intensive task in game development due to their complexity and frequent updating nature. Traditional automated game testing approaches struggle to achieve high state coverage and efficiency in these rich, open-ended environments, while existing LLM-based game-playing approaches are limited to shallow reasoning ability in understanding complex game state-action spaces and long-complex tasks. To address these challenges, we propose TITAN, an effective LLM-driven agent framework for intelligent MMORPG testing. TITAN incorporates four key components to: (1) perceive and abstract high-dimensional game states, (2) proactively optimize and prioritize available actions, (3) enable long-horizon reasoning with action trace memory and reflective self-correction, and (4) employ LLM-based oracles to detect potential functional and logic bugs with diagnostic reports. We implement the prototype of TITAN and evaluate it on two large-scale commercial MMORPGs spanning both PC and mobile platforms. In our experiments, TITAN achieves significantly higher task completion rates (95%) and bug detection performance compared to existing automated game testing approaches. An ablation study further demonstrates that each core component of TITAN contributes substantially to its overall performance. Notably, TITAN detects four previously unknown bugs that prior testing approaches fail to identify. We provide an in-depth discussion of these results, which offer guidance for new avenues of advancing intelligent, general-purpose testing systems. Moreover, TITAN has been deployed in eight real-world game QA pipelines, underscoring its practical impact as an LLM-driven game testing framework.</p></details> | 17 pages |

While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16 pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support more flexible sparsity patterns.

| **[Universal Legal Article Prediction via Tight Collaboration between Supervised Classification Model and LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22119v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legal Article Prediction (LAP) is a critical task in legal text classification, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automatically predict relevant legal articles based on the fact descriptions of cases. As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal role in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties. Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs), such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to their inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while excelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due to the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the diversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most approaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability. To address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for legal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through tight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel Top-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We evaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to ICAIL 2025 (International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law)</p></details> |
| **[Boosting LLM Serving through Spatial-Temporal GPU Resource Sharing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19516v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern LLM serving systems confront inefficient GPU utilization due to the fundamental mismatch between compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases. While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[SK2Decompile: LLM-based Two-Phase Binary Decompilation from Skeleton to Skin](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22114v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising approach for binary decompilation. However, the existing LLM-based decompilers still are somewhat limited in effectively presenting a program's source-level structure with its original identifiers. To mitigate this, we introduce SK2Decompile, a novel two-phase approach to decompile from the skeleton (semantic structure) to the skin (identifier) of programs. Specifically, we first apply a Structure Recovery model to translate a program's binary code to an Intermediate Representation (IR) as deriving the program's "skeleton", i.e., preserving control flow and data structures while obfuscating all identifiers with generic placeholders. We also apply reinforcement learning to reward the model for producing program structures that adhere to the syntactic and semantic rules expected by compilers. Second, we apply an Identifier Naming model to produce meaningful identifiers which reflect actual program semantics as deriving the program's "skin". We train the Identifier Naming model with a separate reinforcement learning objective that rewards the semantic similarity between its predictions and the reference code. Such a two-phase decompilation process facilitates advancing the correctness and readability of decompilation independently. Our evaluations indicate that SK2Decompile, significantly outperforms the SOTA baselines, achieving 21.6% average re-executability rate gain over GPT-5-mini on the HumanEval dataset and 29.4% average R2I improvement over Idioms on the GitHub2025 benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Follow the Path: Reasoning over Knowledge Graph Paths to Improve LLM Factuality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11140v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce fs1, a simple yet effective method that improves the factuality of reasoning traces by sourcing them from large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) and grounding them by conditioning on knowledge graph (KG) paths. We fine-tune eight instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) on 3.9K factually grounded reasoning traces and rigorously evaluate them on six complex open-domain question-answering (QA) benchmarks encompassing 23.9K questions. Our results demonstrate that our fs1-tuned model (32B parameters) consistently outperforms instruction-tuned counterparts with parallel sampling by 6-14 absolute points (pass@$16$). Our detailed analysis shows that fs1 considerably improves model performance over more complex questions (requiring 3 or more hops on KG paths) and numerical answer types compared to the baselines. Furthermore, in single-pass inference, we notice that smaller LLMs show the most improvements. While prior works demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning traces primarily in the STEM domains, our work shows strong evidence that anchoring reasoning to factual KG paths is a critical step in transforming LLMs for reliable knowledge-intensive tasks.</p></details> | Updated version 26.9 |
| **[COSPADI: Compressing LLMs via Calibration-Guided Sparse Dictionary Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22075v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Rogue Scalpel: Activation Steering Compromises LLM Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22067v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite: steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not guarantee precise control over model behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Thinking Spectrum: An Empirical Study of Tunable Reasoning in LLMs through Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22034v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising, training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model. While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves, providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape. Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces. Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning profiles to meet diverse application demands.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlearning Isn't Deletion: Investigating Reversibility of Machine Unlearning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16831v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) aims to remove specified data, but its efficacy is typically assessed with task-level metrics like accuracy and perplexity. We demonstrate that these metrics are often misleading, as models can appear to forget while their original behavior is easily restored through minimal fine-tuning. This phenomenon of \emph{reversibility} suggests that information is merely suppressed, not genuinely erased. To address this critical evaluation gap, we introduce a \emph{representation-level analysis framework}. Our toolkit comprises PCA-based similarity and shift, centered kernel alignment (CKA), and Fisher information, complemented by a summary metric, the mean PCA distance, to measure representational drift. Applying this framework across six unlearning methods, three data domains, and two LLMs, we identify four distinct forgetting regimes based on their \emph{reversibility} and \emph{catastrophicity}. Our analysis reveals that achieving the ideal state--irreversible, non-catastrophic forgetting--is exceptionally challenging. By probing the limits of unlearning, we identify a case of seemingly irreversible, targeted forgetting, offering new insights for designing more robust erasure algorithms. Our findings expose a fundamental gap in current evaluation practices and establish a representation-level foundation for trustworthy unlearning.</p></details> | 46 pages |
| **[LoopServe: An Adaptive Dual-phase LLM Inference Acceleration System for Multi-Turn Dialogues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13681v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. As a result, these models cannot accurately identify and prioritize the most relevant context, leading to degraded response quality. In this paper, we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a new benchmark with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide range of long-context dialogue tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[WAVE: Learning Unified & Versatile Audio-Visual Embeddings with Multimodal LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21990v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like audio and video remains underexplored. We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \& \textbf{v}ersatile \textbf{a}udio-\textbf{v}isual \textbf{e}mbeddings), the first LLM-based embedding that creates a unified representation space for text, audio, and video modalities. WAVE employs a novel hierarchical feature fusion strategy and a joint multi-modal, multi-task training approach to enable two key capabilities: any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and the generation of prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature also yields remarkable performance in multimodal question answering, significantly outperforming existing embedding models. Ablation studies validate our joint training strategy, demonstrating improved performance across all modalities. With a newly introduced benchmark for versatile audio-visual learning, WAVE opens up broad possibilities for cross-modal, any-to-any applications. Our code, checkpoints, and data will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Agentic OS: An LLM Agent Framework for Linux Schedulers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01245v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act"). Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic analysis. We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced in https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/schedcp</p></details> |  |

Due to their strong planning and reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Factors Affect LLMs and RLLMs in Financial Question Answering?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08339v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate: (1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for RLLMs. Additionally, we discuss strategies for enhancing the performance of LLMs and RLLMs in financial question answering, which may serve as a inspiration for future improvements. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.</p></details> | Preprint |

We propose integrating motivational knowledge graphs and socratic dialogue to address these limitations in enhanced LLM ideation (MotivGraph-SoIQ). This novel framework provides essential grounding and practical idea improvement steps for LLM ideation by integrating a Motivational Knowledge Graph (MotivGraph) with a Q-Driven Socratic Ideator. The MotivGraph structurally stores three key node types(problem, challenge and solution) to offer motivation grounding for the LLM ideation process. The Ideator is a dual-agent system utilizing Socratic questioning, which facilitates a rigorous refinement process that mitigates confirmation bias and improves idea quality across novelty, experimental rigor, and motivational rationality dimensions. On the ICLR25 paper topics dataset, MotivGraph-SoIQ exhibits clear advantages over existing state-of-the-art approaches across LLM-based scoring, ELO ranking, and human evaluation metrics.</p></details> | EMNLP2025 Findings |

Rather than relying on manual prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce \textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in computation.

In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment.

However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for reasoning. Specifically, sparse rewards fail to deliver sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such rewards induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across intermediate steps. To address these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a method designed to deliver dense rewards and amplify exploration in the RL-based paradigm. i-MENTOR introduces three innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational efficiency; error-conditioned reward allocation to ensure efficient exploration on challenging samples while intrinsically stabilizing training; and advantage-preserving integration that maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory guidance. Experiments across 4 public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's effectiveness, achieving a 22.23\% improvement on AIME 2024.</p></details> |  |

Recent LLM-TTS systems achieve strong controllability and zero-shot generalization, but their large parameter counts and high latency limit real-world deployment. SPADE addresses this by combining (i) a pruning step guided by a word-error-rate-based layer importance index to remove non-essential Transformer layers, with (ii) multi-level knowledge distillation to restore autoregressive coherence. On zero-shot benchmarks, SPADE preserves near-parity perceptual quality while halving Transformer depth, reducing VRAM usage by up to 20%, and achieving up to 1.7x faster real-time factor with less than 5% of the original training data. These results show that compact LLM-TTS models can maintain naturalness and speaker similarity while enabling practical real-time speech generation.

This paper introduces a systematic methodology and a foundational dataset to address this problem. We first present a new, publicly available dataset of Turkish citation intents, created with a purpose-built annotation tool. We then evaluate the performance of standard In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating that its effectiveness is limited by inconsistent results caused by manually designed prompts. To address this core limitation, we introduce a programmable classification pipeline built on the DSPy framework, which automates prompt optimization systematically. For final classification, we employ a stacked generalization ensemble to aggregate outputs from multiple optimized models, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. This ensemble, with an XGBoost meta-model, achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3\%. Ultimately, this study provides the Turkish NLP community and the broader academic circles with a foundational dataset and a robust classification framework paving the way for future qualitative citation studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE UBMK 2025 International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering</p></details> |

While various approaches to LLM personalization such as prompt-based and training-based methods have been actively explored, the development of effective decoding-time algorithms remains largely overlooked, despite their demonstrated potential. In this paper, we propose CoPe (Contrasting Personal Preference), a novel decoding-time approach applied after performing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on user-specific data. Our core idea is to leverage reward-guided decoding specifically for personalization by maximizing each user's implicit reward signal.

| **[TrustJudge: Inconsistencies of LLM-as-a-Judge and How to Alleviate Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21117v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1) Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1) distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment. The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without requiring additional training or human annotations.

We study how students with varied expertise use LLMs to complete Python-based data analysis in computational notebooks in a non-major course. Drawing on homework logs, recordings, and surveys from 36 students, we ask: Which expertise matters most, and how does it shape AI use? Our mixed-methods analysis shows that technical expertise -- not AI familiarity or communication skills -- remains a significant predictor of success. Students also vary widely in how they leverage LLMs, struggling at stages of forming intent, expressing inputs, interpreting outputs, and assessing results. We identify success and failure behaviors, such as providing context or decomposing prompts, that distinguish effective use. These findings inform AI literacy interventions, highlighting that lightweight demonstrations improve surface fluency but are insufficient; deeper training and scaffolds are needed to cultivate resilient AI use skills.</p></details> |  |

Facing potential system prompt leakage risks, model developers have implemented strategies to prevent leakage, primarily by disabling LLMs from repeating their context when encountering known attack patterns. However, it remains vulnerable to new and unforeseen prompt-leaking techniques. In this paper, we first introduce a simple yet effective prompt leaking attack to reveal such risks. Our attack is capable of extracting system prompts from various LLM-based application, even from SOTA LLM models such as GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our findings further inspire us to search for a fundamental solution to the problems by having no system prompt in the context. To this end, we propose SysVec, a novel method that encodes system prompts as internal representation vectors rather than raw text. By doing so, SysVec minimizes the risk of unauthorized disclosure while preserving the LLM's core language capabilities. Remarkably, this approach not only enhances security but also improves the model's general instruction-following abilities. Experimental results demonstrate that SysVec effectively mitigates prompt leakage attacks, preserves the LLM's functional integrity, and helps alleviate the forgetting issue in long-context scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 tables, 6figures, accepted by CCS 25</p></details> |

However, current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61 points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts in RLVR.</p></details> |  |

Insights From an Iterative Design Engagement in Emergency Preparedness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21868v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is growing interest in using Large Language Models as agents (LLM agents) for social simulations to inform policy, yet real-world adoption remains limited. This paper addresses the question: How can LLM agent simulations be made genuinely useful for policy? We report on a year-long iterative design engagement with a university emergency preparedness team. Across multiple design iterations, we iteratively developed a system of 13,000 LLM agents that simulate crowd movement and communication during a large-scale gathering under various emergency scenarios. These simulations informed actual policy implementation, shaping volunteer training, evacuation protocols, and infrastructure planning. Analyzing this process, we identify three design implications: start with verifiable scenarios and build trust gradually, use preliminary simulations to elicit tacit knowledge, and treat simulation and policy development as evolving together. These implications highlight actionable pathways to making LLM agent simulations that are genuinely useful for policy.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance on Low-Resource Programming Languages (LRPLs) and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) remains a significant challenge, affecting millions of developers-3.5 million users in Rust alone-who cannot fully utilize LLM capabilities. LRPLs and DSLs encounter unique obstacles, including data scarcity and, for DSLs, specialized syntax that is poorly represented in general-purpose datasets. Addressing these challenges is crucial, as LRPLs and DSLs enhance development efficiency in specialized domains, such as finance and science. While several surveys discuss LLMs in software engineering, none focus specifically on the challenges and opportunities associated with LRPLs and DSLs. Our survey fills this gap by systematically reviewing the current state, methodologies, and challenges in leveraging LLMs for code generation in these languages. We filtered 111 papers from over 27,000 published studies between 2020 and 2024 to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in LRPLs and DSLs. We report the LLMs used, benchmarks, and metrics for evaluation, strategies for enhancing performance, and methods for dataset collection and curation. We identified four main evaluation techniques and several metrics for assessing code generation in LRPLs and DSLs. Our analysis categorizes improvement methods into six groups and summarizes novel architectures proposed by researchers. Despite various techniques and metrics, a standard approach and benchmark dataset for evaluating code generation in LRPLs and DSLs are lacking. This survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners at the intersection of LLMs, software engineering, and specialized programming languages, laying the groundwork for future advancements in code generation for LRPLs and DSLs.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages, 3 figures, 15 tables.

To address this issue, we propose LLM-OptiRA, the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically detect and transform non-convex components into solvable forms, enabling fully automated resolution of non-convex resource allocation problems in wireless communication systems. LLM-OptiRA not only simplifies problem-solving by reducing reliance on expert knowledge, but also integrates error correction and feasibility validation mechanisms to ensure robustness.

However, they face a fundamental challenge in open-ended text generation: determining output reliability when generation quality lies on a continuous spectrum, often with multiple valid responses. To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence. Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by up to 60%. Our method requires no model internals, works across black-box APIs, and remains robust to model updates, making it a practical baseline for real-world LLM deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this paper, based on classic theories from memory science and cognitive science, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and selective forgetting. Existing benchmarks either rely on limited context lengths or are tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally accumulate information. Moreover, no existing benchmarks cover all four competencies. We introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark transforms existing long-context datasets and incorporates newly constructed datasets into a multi-turn format, effectively simulating the incremental information processing characteristic of memory agents. By carefully selecting and curating datasets, our benchmark provides comprehensive coverage of the four core memory competencies outlined above, thereby offering a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies, underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms for LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Y.

We focus on puzzles used in Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. We first extend the existing benchmark for the task of solving linguistic puzzles. We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), including recent state-of-the-art models such as OpenAI's o1, for solving linguistic puzzles, analyzing their performance across various linguistic topics. We demonstrate that LLMs outperform humans on most puzzles types, except for those centered on writing systems, and for the understudied languages. We use the insights from puzzle-solving experiments to direct the novel task of puzzle generation. We believe that automating puzzle generation, even for relatively simple puzzles, holds promise for expanding interest in linguistics and introducing the field to a broader audience. This finding highlights the importance of linguistic puzzle generation as a research task: such puzzles can not only promote linguistics but also support the dissemination of knowledge about rare and understudied languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of Main Conference of the 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025)</p></details> |

To overcome this challenge, we present prima.cpp, a distributed on-device inference system that runs 30-70B LLMs on consumer home clusters with mixed CPUs/GPUs, insufficient RAM/VRAM, slow disks, Wi-Fi links, and heterogeneous OSs. We introduce pipelined-ring parallelism (PRP) to overlap disk I/O with compute and communication, and address the prefetch-release conflict in mmap-based offloading. We further propose Halda, a heterogeneity-aware scheduler that co-optimizes per-device CPU/GPU workloads and device selection under RAM/VRAM constraints. On four consumer home devices, a 70B model reaches 674 ms/token TPOT with <6% memory pressure, and a 32B model with speculative decoding achieves 26 tokens/s. Compared with llama.cpp, exo, and dllama, our proposed prima.cpp achieves 5-17x lower TPOT, supports fine-grained model sizes from 8B to 70B, ensures broader cross-OS and quantization compatibility, and remains OOM-free, while also being Wi-Fi tolerant, privacy-preserving, and hardware-independent.

Bayesian Optimization (BO) provides an effective framework for such problems. However, traditional BO methods are prone to get trapped in local optima and often lack interpretable insights. To address this issue, this paper designs Reasoning BO, a novel framework that leverages reasoning models to guide the sampling process in BO while incorporating multi-agent systems and knowledge graphs for online knowledge accumulation. By integrating the reasoning and contextual understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we can provide strong guidance to enhance the BO process. As the optimization progresses, Reasoning BO provides real-time sampling recommendations along with critical insights grounded in plausible scientific theories, aiding in the discovery of superior solutions within the search space. We systematically evaluate our approach across 10 diverse tasks encompassing synthetic mathematical functions and complex real-world applications. The framework demonstrates its capability to progressively refine sampling strategies through real-time insights and hypothesis evolution, effectively identifying higher-performing regions of the search space for focused exploration. This process highlights the powerful reasoning and context-learning abilities of LLMs in optimization scenarios. For example, in the Direct Arylation task, our method increased the yield to 60.7%, whereas traditional BO achieved only a 25.2% yield. Furthermore, our investigation reveals that smaller LLMs, when fine-tuned through reinforcement learning, can attain comparable performance to their larger counterparts.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we empirically study the capabilities of three LLMs -- ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude -- in countering political misinformation. We implement a two-step, chain-of-thought prompting approach, where models first identify credible sources for a given claim and then generate persuasive responses. Our findings suggest that models struggle to ground their responses in real news sources, and tend to prefer citing left-leaning sources. We also observe varying degrees of response diversity among models. Our findings highlight concerns about using LLMs for fact-checking through only prompt-engineering, emphasizing the need for more robust guardrails.

Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding. To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review on ICLR 2026;Work in progress;</p></details> |

Current prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated inferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD) framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390 real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs (Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with gains up to 22.3% (MACD). In direct comparison with physician-only diagnosis under the same evaluation protocol, MACD achieves comparable or superior performance, with improvements up to 16%. Furthermore, the MACD-human workflow yields an 18.6% improvement over physician-only diagnosis, demonstrating the synergistic potential of human-AI collaboration. Notably, the self-learned clinical knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability across LLMs, and capacity for model-specific personalization.This work thus presents a scalable self-learning paradigm that bridges the gap between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We address two deployment-critical questions with process-level precision: Where along a step-structured solution does degradation first arise? How to mitigate it while staying in the low-bit regime? Across widely used PTQ methods (AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant), open-source model families (Qwen, LLaMA; 0.5--7B), and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, AIME), we perform format-aligned chain-of-thought with step-aligned attribution and uncover two robust regularities: (i) PTQ disproportionately elevates method and execution errors relative to high-level conceptual mistakes; and (ii) failures emerge early, with the first vulnerable step flipping and cascading to the final answer. These regularities suggest a general intervention principle: restore local token-level margins exactly at the earliest failure frontier. We instantiate this principle as a lightweight measure$\rightarrow$locate$\rightarrow$restore loop that operates directly on the quantized model: detect the first faulty step, construct our "Silver Bullet" datasets, and apply small-scale supervised/preference tuning. In our settings, as few as 332 curated examples and 3--5 minutes of compute on a single GPU recover 4-bit weight math reasoning toward the full-precision baseline while preserving PTQ efficiency. Our framework is quantizer- and architecture-agnostic within the evaluated regimes, and turns low-bit degradation from a global accuracy problem into a local, reproducible process intervention.</p></details> | 23pages |

To address these challenges, we propose Agent-as-Interviewer, a dynamic evaluation paradigm that employs LLM agents to conduct multi-turn interactions for evaluation. Unlike current benchmarking or dynamic interaction paradigms, Agent-as-Interviewer utilizes agents to invoke knowledge tools for wider and deeper knowledge in the dynamic multi-turn question generation, achieving more comprehensive evaluations of LLM's knowledge boundaries. It also leverages agents to plan query strategies for adjustment of the question difficulty levels, enhancing the difficulty control to match the actual capabilities of target LLMs. Based on this paradigm, we develop JudgeAgent, a knowledge-wise dynamic evaluation framework that employs knowledge-driven synthesis as the agent's tool and uses difficulty scoring as strategy guidance, thereby finally providing valuable suggestions to help targets optimize themselves. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of JudgeAgent's suggestions, demonstrating that Agent-as-Interviewer can accurately identify the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models.

A judgment is often extracted from the judge's textual output alone, typically with greedy decoding. However, LLM judges naturally provide distributions over judgment tokens, inviting a breadth of inference methods for extracting fine-grained preferences. We find that taking the mean of the judgment distribution consistently outperforms taking the mode (i.e. greedy decoding) in all evaluation settings (i.e. pointwise, pairwise, and listwise). We further explore novel methods of deriving preferences from judgment distributions, and find that methods incorporating risk aversion often improve performance. Lastly, we analyze LLM-as-a-judge paired with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, showing that CoT can collapse the spread of the judgment distribution, often harming performance. Our findings show that leveraging distributional output improves LLM-as-a-judge, as opposed to using the text interface alone.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

To address these challenges, we introduce FINDAP, a systematic and fine-grained investigation into domain-adaptive post-training of LLMs for the finance domain. Our approach consists of four key components: FinCap, which defines the core capabilities required for the target domain; FinRec, an effective training recipe that jointly optimizes continual pre-training and instruction-following, along with a novel preference data distillation method leveraging process signals from a generative reward model; FinTrain, a curated set of training datasets supporting FinRec; and FinEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite aligned with FinCap. The resulting model, Llama-Fin, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of financial tasks.

However, these capabilities are predominantly benchmarked on domains like mathematical problem solving and code generation, leaving open the question of whether such reasoning skills generalize to complex real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce LocationReasoner, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities in the context of real-world site selection, where models must identify feasible locations by reasoning over diverse and complicated spatial, environmental, and logistic constraints. The benchmark covers carefully crafted queries of varying difficulty levels and is supported by a sandbox environment with in-house tools for constraint-based location search. Automated verification further guarantees the scalability of the benchmark, enabling the addition of arbitrary number of queries. Extensive evaluations on real-world site selection data from Boston, New York, and Tampa reveal that state-of-the-art reasoning models offer limited improvement over their non-reasoning predecessors in real-world contexts, with even the latest OpenAI o4 model failing on 30% of site selection tasks. Moreover, agentic strategies such as ReAct and Reflexion often suffer from over-reasoning, leading to worse outcomes than direct prompting. With key limitations of LLMs in holistic and non-linear reasoning highlighted, we release LocationReasoner to foster the development of LLMs and agents capable of robust, grounded reasoning in real-world decision-making tasks.

However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While graph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures, they face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge graphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted graphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval, answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of MACER framework.</p></details> | 28 pages, 17 figures |

FlexMind exposes users to a broad set of ideas while enabling a lightweight transition into deeper engagement. In a study comparing ideation with FlexMind to ChatGPT, participants generated higher-quality ideas with FlexMind, due to both broader exposure and deeper engagement with tradeoffs. By scaffolding ideation across breadth, depth, and reflective evaluation, FlexMind empowers users to surface ideas that might otherwise go unnoticed or be prematurely discarded.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vulnerability of LLMs to Vertically Aligned Text Manipulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20016v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vertical text input is commonly encountered in various real-world applications, such as mathematical computations and word-based Sudoku puzzles. While current large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural language tasks, they remain vulnerable to variations in text formatting. Recent research demonstrates that modifying input formats, such as vertically aligning words for encoder-based models, can substantially lower accuracy in text classification tasks. While easily understood by humans, these inputs can significantly mislead models, posing a potential risk of bypassing detection in real-world scenarios involving harmful or sensitive information. With the expanding application of LLMs, a crucial question arises: Do decoder-based LLMs exhibit similar vulnerabilities to vertically formatted text input? In this paper, we investigate the impact of vertical text input on the performance of various LLMs across multiple text classification datasets and analyze the underlying causes. Our findings are as follows: (i) Vertical text input significantly degrades the accuracy of LLMs in text classification tasks. (ii) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning does not help LLMs recognize vertical input or mitigate its vulnerability, but few-shot learning with careful analysis does. (iii) We explore the underlying cause of the vulnerability by analyzing the inherent issues in tokenization and attention matrices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

However, state-of-the-art video diffusion models frequently produce implausible results such as momentum violations and object interpenetrations. Existing physics-aware approaches often rely on task-specific fine-tuning or supervised data, which limits their scalability and applicability. To address the challenge, we present PhyMAGIC, a training-free framework that generates physically consistent motion from a single image. PhyMAGIC integrates a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model, confidence-guided reasoning via LLMs, and a differentiable physics simulator to produce 3D assets ready for downstream physical simulation without fine-tuning or manual supervision. By iteratively refining motion prompts using LLM-derived confidence scores and leveraging simulation feedback, PhyMAGIC steers generation toward physically consistent dynamics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PhyMAGIC outperforms state-of-the-art video generators and physics-aware baselines, enhancing physical property inference and motion-text alignment while maintaining visual fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[InvBench: Can LLMs Accelerate Program Verification with Invariant Synthesis?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21629v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program verification relies on loop invariants, yet automatically discovering strong invariants remains a long-standing challenge. We introduce a principled framework for evaluating LLMs on invariant synthesis. Our approach uses a verifier-based decision procedure with a formal soundness guarantee and assesses not only correctness but also the speedup that invariants provide in verification. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, and existing LLM-based verifiers against the traditional solver UAutomizer. While LLM-based verifiers represent a promising direction, they do not yet offer a significant advantage over UAutomizer. Model capability also proves critical, as shown by sharp differences in speedups across models, and our benchmark remains an open challenge for current LLMs. Finally, we show that supervised fine-tuning and Best-of-N sampling can improve performance: fine-tuning on 3589 instances raises the percentage of speedup cases for Qwen3-Coder-480B from 8% to 29.2%, and Best-of-N sampling with N=16 improves Claude-sonnet-4 from 8.8% to 22.1%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Persona-Augmented Benchmarking: Evaluating LLMs Across Diverse Writing Styles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22168v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not exhibit enough writing style diversity, with many adhering primarily to standardized conventions. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the rich variety of communication patterns exhibited by humans. Thus, it is possible that LLMs, which are optimized on these benchmarks, may demonstrate brittle performance when faced with "non-standard" input. In this work, we test this hypothesis by rewriting evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting, a low-cost method to emulate diverse writing styles. Our results show that, even with identical semantic content, variations in writing style and prompt formatting significantly impact the estimated performance of the LLM under evaluation. Notably, we identify distinct writing styles that consistently trigger either low or high performance across a range of models and tasks, irrespective of model family, size, and recency. Our work offers a scalable approach to augment existing benchmarks, improving the external validity of the assessments they provide for measuring LLM performance across linguistic variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate striking linguistic abilities, yet whether they achieve this same balance remains unclear. We apply the Information Bottleneck principle to quantitatively compare how LLMs and humans navigate this compression-meaning trade-off. Analyzing embeddings from 40+ LLMs against classic human categorization benchmarks, we uncover three key findings. First, LLMs broadly align with human categories but miss fine-grained semantic distinctions crucial for human understanding. Second, LLMs demonstrate aggressive statistical compression, achieving ``optimal'' information-theoretic efficiency, while humans prioritize contextual richness and adaptive flexibility. Third, encoder models surprisingly outperform decoder models in human alignment, suggesting that generation and understanding rely on distinct mechanisms in current architectures. In addition, training dynamics analysis reveals that conceptual structure develops in distinct phases: rapid initial formation followed by architectural reorganization, with semantic processing migrating from deeper to mid-network layers as models discover more efficient encoding. These divergent strategies, where LLMs optimize for compression and humans for adaptive utility, reveal fundamental differences between artificial and biological intelligence, guiding development toward more human-aligned AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network Formation and Dynamics Among Multi-LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10659v6)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social networks profoundly influence how humans form opinions, exchange information, and organize collectively. As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded into social and professional environments, it is critical to understand whether their interactions approximate human-like network dynamics. We develop a framework to study the network formation behaviors of multiple LLM agents and benchmark them against human decisions. Across synthetic and real-world settings, including friendship, telecommunication, and employment networks, we find that LLMs consistently reproduce fundamental micro-level principles such as preferential attachment, triadic closure, and homophily, as well as macro-level properties including community structure and small-world effects. Importantly, the relative emphasis of these principles adapts to context: for example, LLMs favor homophily in friendship networks but heterophily in organizational settings, mirroring patterns of social mobility. A controlled human-subject survey confirms strong alignment between LLMs and human participants in link-formation decisions. These results establish that LLMs can serve as powerful tools for social simulation and synthetic data generation, while also raising critical questions about bias, fairness, and the design of AI systems that participate in human networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at PNAS Nexus</p></details> |

Prior work has introduced additional constraints using commonsense knowledge, but obtaining such priors has traditionally been labor-intensive and lacks generalizability across diverse object categories. We address this limitation by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to provide commonsense knowledge of object geometric attributes, specifically size and orientation, as prior factors in a graph-based SLAM framework. These priors are particularly beneficial during the initial phase when object observations are limited. We implement a complete pipeline integrating these priors, achieving robust data association on sparse object-level features and enabling real-time object SLAM. Our system, evaluated on the TUM RGB-D and 3RScan datasets, improves mapping accuracy by 36.8\% over the latest baseline. Additionally, we present real-world experiments in the supplementary video, demonstrating its real-time performance.</p></details> |  |

It expands on existing LLM translation research and industry benchmarks, which emphasise grammatical accuracy and token-level correctness, by focusing on cultural appropriateness and overall localisation quality - critical factors for real-world applications like marketing and e-commerce. To investigate these challenges, this project evaluated a sample of 87 LLM-generated translations of e-commerce marketing emails across 24 regional dialects of 20 languages. Human reviewers fluent in each target language provided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to the original's tone, meaning, and intended audience. Findings suggest that, while leading models generally produce grammatically correct translations, culturally nuanced language remains a clear area for improvement, often requiring substantial human refinement. Notably, even high-resource global languages, despite topping industry benchmark leaderboards, frequently mistranslated figurative expressions and wordplay. This work challenges the assumption that data volume is the most reliable predictor of machine translation quality and introduces cultural appropriateness as a key determinant of multilingual LLM performance - an area currently underexplored in existing academic and industry benchmarks. As a proof of concept, this pilot highlights limitations of current multilingual AI systems for real-world localisation use cases. Results of this pilot support the opportunity for expanded research at greater scale to deliver generalisable insights and inform deployment of reliable machine translation workflows in culturally diverse contexts.</p></details> |  |

In this work we adopt tools from mechanistic interpretability to unveil sociodemographic representations and biases within LLMs in the context of healthcare. Specifically, we ask: Can we identify activations within LLMs that encode sociodemographic information (e.g., gender, race)? We find that gender information is highly localized in MLP layers and can be reliably manipulated at inference time via patching. Such interventions can surgically alter generated clinical vignettes for specific conditions, and also influence downstream clinical predictions which correlate with gender, e.g., patient risk of depression. We find that representation of patient race is somewhat more distributed, but can also be intervened upon, to a degree. To our knowledge, this is the first application of mechanistic interpretability methods to LLMs for healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMNLP (Findings)</p></details> |

However, this design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Practitioners and researchers face a choice: let models generate citations during decoding, or let models draft answers first and then attach appropriate citations. To clarify this choice, we introduce two paradigms: Generation-Time Citation (G-Cite), which produces the answer and citations in one pass, and Post-hoc Citation (P-Cite), which adds or verifies citations after drafting. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation from zero-shot to advanced retrieval-augmented methods across four popular attribution datasets and provide evidence-based recommendations that weigh trade-offs across use cases. Our results show a consistent trade-off between coverage and citation correctness, with retrieval as the main driver of attribution quality in both paradigms. P-Cite methods achieve high coverage with competitive correctness and moderate latency, whereas G-Cite methods prioritize precision at the cost of coverage and speed. We recommend a retrieval-centric, P-Cite-first approach for high-stakes applications, reserving G-Cite for precision-critical settings such as strict claim verification.

Task and motion planning (TAMP) addresses this by grounding symbolic plans in low-level execution, yet it relies heavily on manually engineered planning domains. To improve long-horizon planning reliability and reduce human intervention, we present Planning Domain Derivation with LLMs (PDDLLM), a framework that automatically induces symbolic predicates and actions directly from demonstration trajectories by combining LLM reasoning with physical simulation roll-outs. Unlike prior domain-inference methods that rely on partially predefined or language descriptions of planning domains, PDDLLM constructs domains without manual domain initialization and automatically integrates them with motion planners to produce executable plans, enhancing long-horizon planning automation. Across 1,200 tasks in nine environments, PDDLLM outperforms six LLM-based planning baselines, achieving at least 20\% higher success rates, reduced token costs, and successful deployment on multiple physical robot platforms.</p></details> | 35 pages, 10 figures |

Here we introduce a novel methodology for quantitatively evaluating metacognitive abilities in LLMs. Taking inspiration from research on metacognition in nonhuman animals, our approach eschews model self-reports and instead tests to what degree models can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states. Using two experimental paradigms, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs introduced since early 2024 show increasingly strong evidence of certain metacognitive abilities, specifically the ability to assess and utilize their own confidence in their ability to answer factual and reasoning questions correctly and the ability to anticipate what answers they would give and utilize that information appropriately. We buttress these behavioral findings with an analysis of the token probabilities returned by the models, which suggests the presence of an upstream internal signal that could provide the basis for metacognition. We further find that these abilities 1) are limited in resolution, 2) emerge in context-dependent manners, and 3) seem to be qualitatively different from those of humans. We also report intriguing differences across models of similar capabilities, suggesting that LLM post-training may have a role in developing metacognitive abilities.</p></details> | 25 pages, 22 figures |

Prior approaches, however, have largely treated these domains as search utilities, with limited attention to their potential as scalable sources of reasoning data. At the same time, progress in reasoning LLMs has been driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, whose application in robotics remains dependent on costly, human-curated datasets. We propose Plan2Evolve, an LLM self-evolving framework in which the base model generates planning domains that serve as engines for producing symbolic problem-plan pairs as reasoning traces. These pairs are then transformed into extended CoT trajectories by the same model through natural-language explanations, thereby explicitly aligning symbolic planning structures with natural language reasoning. The resulting data extend beyond the model's intrinsic planning capacity, enabling model fine-tuning that yields a planning-enhanced LLM with improved planning success, stronger cross-task generalization, and reduced inference costs.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |
| **[DAMR: Efficient and Adaptive Context-Aware Knowledge Graph Question Answering with LLM-Guided MCTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00719v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Existing methods primarily follow either the retrieve-then-reason paradigm, which relies on Graph Neural Networks or heuristic rules to extract static candidate paths, or dynamic path generation strategies that employ LLMs with prompting to jointly perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former lacks adaptability due to static path extraction and the absence of contextual refinement, while the latter suffers from high computational costs and limited evaluation accuracy because of their dependence on fixed scoring functions and repeated LLM calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with adaptive path evaluation to enable efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR leverages MCTS as a backbone, where an LLM-based planner selects the top-$k$ semantically relevant relations at each expansion step to effectively reduce the search space. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention, thereby capturing fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, to mitigate the scarcity of high-quality supervision, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, enabling the scorer to continually adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR significantly outperforms SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preemptive Detection and Steering of LLM Misalignment via Latent Reachability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21528v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment, BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together, these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, a novel cross-domain knowledge transfer framework is proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs in time series forecasting -- a task of increasing relevance in fields such as energy systems, finance, and healthcare. The approach systematically infuses LLMs with structured temporal information to improve their forecasting accuracy. This study evaluates the proposed method on a real-world time series dataset and compares it to a naive baseline where the LLM receives no auxiliary information. Results show that knowledge-informed forecasting significantly outperforms the uninformed baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization. These findings highlight the potential of knowledge transfer strategies to bridge the gap between LLMs and domain-specific forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating these systems is challenging, as their rapid evolution outpaces traditional human evaluation. Researchers have proposed LLM Agents to simulate participants as digital twins, but it remains unclear to what extent a digital twin can represent a specific customer in multi-turn interaction with an agentic AI system. In this paper, we recruited 40 human participants to shop with Amazon Rufus, collected their personas, interaction traces, and UX feedback, and then created digital twins to repeat the task. Pairwise comparison of human and digital-twin traces shows that while agents often explored more diverse choices, their action patterns aligned with humans and yielded similar design feedback. This study is the first to quantify how closely LLM agents can mirror human multi-turn interaction with an agentic AI system, highlighting their potential for scalable evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Code-Induced Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21499v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist. Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

We build Sci2Pol-Bench on a five-stage taxonomy to mirror the human writing process: (i) Autocompletion, (ii) Understanding, (iii) Summarization, (iv) Generation, and (v) Verification. It features 18 tasks in multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Specifically, for the Generation stage, we show that BERTScore and ROUGE scores fail to capture the quality of brief writing, and introduce a new LLM-based evaluation metric aligned with expert judgement. Using this benchmark, we evaluate 13 leading open-source and commercial LLMs to uncover key limitations. To improve LLM performance on brief writing, we curate the Sci2Pol-Corpus for fine-tuning. We start by linking each cited scientific paper to its corresponding policy document, drawn from 5.6 million policy records. This produces 140,000 candidate pairs. We then employ an LLM-as-a-judge to filter high-quality examples, followed by in-context polishing using three expert-written samples as references. This process yields a final set of 639 new pairs. Finally, we fine-tune three models on Sci2Pol-Corpus: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-12B, and Gemma-27B. Fine-tuning leads to consistent performance improvements across Sci2Pol-Bench. Notably, after fine-tuning, Gemma-27B surpasses the much larger GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 (671B). These demonstrate the effectiveness of our corpus in bridging the gap between science and policy.</p></details> |  |

While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable 3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich 3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular representations.</p></details> |  |

However, current PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption. We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of 4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and 87.1\%, respectively.

However, manually creating such scenarios in simulation remains a significant and time-consuming challenge. This work introduces a novel method that generates dynamic temporal scene graphs corresponding to diverse traffic scenarios, on-demand, tailored to user-defined preferences, such as AV actions, sets of dynamic agents, and criticality levels.

| **[Learnable Kernel Density Estimation for Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21285v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a framework LGKDE that learns kernel density estimation for graphs. The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation (KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error, robustness, and generalization. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on most benchmark datasets.</p></details> | Under Review |

Typical efforts enhance MPGNN's expressive power by enriching the adjacency-based aggregation. In contrast, we introduce an efficient aggregation over walk incidence-based matrices that are constructed to deliberately trade off some expressivity for stronger and more structured inductive bias. Our approach allows for seamless scaling between classical message-passing and simpler methods based on walks. We rigorously characterize the expressive power at each intermediate step using homomorphism counts over a hierarchy of generalized caterpillar graphs. Based on this foundation, we propose Caterpillar GNNs, whose robust graph-level aggregation successfully tackles a benchmark specifically designed to challenge MPGNNs. Moreover, we demonstrate that, on real-world datasets, Caterpillar GNNs achieve comparable predictive performance while significantly reducing the number of nodes in the hidden layers of the computational graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables, preprint in review</p></details> |

However, scaling GNNs to large graphs remains a significant challenge, especially for graph-level tasks. In this work, we introduce SHAKE-GNN, a novel scalable graph-level GNN framework based on a hierarchy of Kirchhoff Forests, a class of random spanning forests used to construct stochastic multi-resolution decompositions of graphs. SHAKE-GNN produces multi-scale representations, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency and performance. We introduce an improved, data-driven strategy for selecting the trade-off parameter and analyse the time-complexity of SHAKE-GNN. Experimental results on multiple large-scale graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that SHAKE-GNN achieves competitive performance while offering improved scalability.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff radii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance; physics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific and lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple parameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead. We introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global context through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution hierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic hierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned transformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual connections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures, MCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\AA} for forces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made available upon acceptance.</p></details> | 27 pages, 1 figures |
| **[Beyond Simple Graphs: Neural Multi-Objective Routing on Multigraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22095v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. Yet, existing methods are unsuitable for routing on multigraphs, which feature multiple edges with distinct attributes between node pairs, despite their strong relevance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose two graph neural network-based methods to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach operates directly on the multigraph by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. The second model, which is more scalable, first simplifies the multigraph via a learned pruning strategy and then performs autoregressive routing on the resulting simple graph. We evaluate both models empirically, across a wide range of problems and graph distributions, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to strong heuristics and neural baselines.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 Figures |

However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Subgraph Isomorphism Network for Predictive Graph Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21699v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the graph-level prediction task (predict a label for a given graph), the information contained in subgraphs of the input graph plays a key role. In this paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph. Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on the selected subgraphs.</p></details> |  |

Yet, Hessians are computationally expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization, zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip</p></details> |

The electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAMR: Efficient and Adaptive Context-Aware Knowledge Graph Question Answering with LLM-Guided MCTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00719v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Existing methods primarily follow either the retrieve-then-reason paradigm, which relies on Graph Neural Networks or heuristic rules to extract static candidate paths, or dynamic path generation strategies that employ LLMs with prompting to jointly perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former lacks adaptability due to static path extraction and the absence of contextual refinement, while the latter suffers from high computational costs and limited evaluation accuracy because of their dependence on fixed scoring functions and repeated LLM calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with adaptive path evaluation to enable efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR leverages MCTS as a backbone, where an LLM-based planner selects the top-$k$ semantically relevant relations at each expansion step to effectively reduce the search space. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention, thereby capturing fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, to mitigate the scarcity of high-quality supervision, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, enabling the scorer to continually adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR significantly outperforms SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Graph Neural Network for Compressed Speech Steganalysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21591v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steganalysis methods based on deep learning (DL) often struggle with computational complexity and challenges in generalizing across different datasets. Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016 seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with low embedding rates.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces GNN-DT, a novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms and delivers high-quality solutions in real-time. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT and offline RL baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior offline and online RL approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Graph Neural Networks are Incomplete on Graphs with a Simple Spectrum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05530v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet, these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on graphs from ZINC.</p></details> | 10 pages main text |
| **[SlideMamba: Entropy-Based Adaptive Fusion of GNN and Mamba for Enhanced Representation Learning in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21239v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters. Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation. We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers, senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses them for future reasoning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam, SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing threats.</p></details> |  |

Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme, we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired with a state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 Tables |

To address these issues, we propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance. Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12 real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery, charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions. Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide': internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically, the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques. Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Medical Image Analysis.

Existing pipelines capture only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability. Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations, and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context. Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines, which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable, reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.</p></details> |  |

The major problem of GED is that its computation is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). However, most NN methods assume a unit cost for edit operations -- a restrictive and often unrealistic simplification, since topological and functional distances rarely coincide in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a fully end-to-end Graph Neural Network framework for learning the edit costs for GED, at a fine-grained level, aligning topological and task-specific similarity. Our method combines an unsupervised self-organizing mechanism for GED approximation with a Generalized Additive Model that flexibly learns contextualized edit costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach overcomes the limitations of non-end-to-end methods, yielding directly interpretable graph matchings, uncovering meaningful structures in complex graphs, and showing strong applicability to domains such as molecular analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, most studies focus on finite and local areas for training, overlooking the influence of broader areas and limiting their ability to generalize effectively. Thus, in this work, we study global weather forecasting that is irregularly distributed and dynamically varying in practice, requiring the model to generalize to unobserved locations. To address such challenges, we propose a general Mesh Interpolation Graph Network (MIGN) that models the irregular weather station forecasting, consisting of two key designs: (1) learning spatially irregular data with regular mesh interpolation network to align the data; (2) leveraging parametric spherical harmonics location embedding to further enhance spatial generalization ability. Extensive experiments on an up-to-date observation dataset show that MIGN significantly outperforms existing data-driven models. Besides, we show that MIGN has spatial generalization ability, and is capable of generalizing to previous unseen stations.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 main track</p></details> |

Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations, particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a robust and effective solution for MPP.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Regardless of their successes, current methods frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID) benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts. Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without specialized DG algorithms (on four out of six benchmarks). Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets, specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Highlighting its model-agnostic design, the method yielded valuable insights into both GT and MPNN backbones and appears well suited for broader DG applications beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.</p></details> |  |

Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Directed Hypergraph Neural Network over abstract syntax tree (AST) for Code Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04228v6)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code classification is a difficult issue in program understanding and automatic coding. Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural network (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 35th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2023) as a regular paper; the latest version is consistent with the official conference version</p></details> |

Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging learning framework to collaboratively train graph data from various clients. Although FGL allows client data to remain localized, a malicious server can still steal client private data information through uploaded gradient. In this paper, we for the first time propose label distribution attacks (LDAs) on FGL that aim to infer the label distributions of the client-side data. Firstly, we observe that the effectiveness of LDA is closely related to the variance of node embeddings in GNNs. Next, we analyze the relation between them and propose a new attack named EC-LDA, which significantly improves the attack effectiveness by compressing node embeddings. Then, extensive experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks across six widely used graph datasets show that EC-LDA outperforms the SOTA LDAs. Specifically, EC-LDA can achieve the Cos-sim as high as 1.0 under almost all cases. Finally, we explore the robustness of EC-LDA under differential privacy protection and discuss the potential effective defense methods to EC-LDA. Our code is available at https://github.com/cheng-t/EC-LDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by 2025 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2025)</p></details> |

The proposed ICP algorithm decomposes a TSP-D solution into smaller segments called chainlets, each optimized individually by a dynamic programming subroutine. The chainlet with the highest improvement is updated, and the procedure is repeated until no further improvement is possible. We show that the subroutine runs in quadratic time and the number of subroutine calls is bounded linearly in problem size for the first iteration and remains constant in subsequent iterations, ensuring algorithmic scalability. Empirical results show that ICP outperforms existing algorithms in both solution quality and computational time. Tested over 1,249 benchmark instances, ICP yields an average improvement of 2.6\% in solution quality over the previous state-of-the-art algorithm while reducing computational time by 91.3\%. The procedure is deterministic, ensuring reliability without requiring multiple runs. The subroutine is the computational bottleneck in the already efficient ICP algorithm. To reduce the necessity of subroutine calls, we integrate a graph neural network (GNN) to predict incremental improvements. We demonstrate that the resulting Neuro ICP (NICP) achieves substantial acceleration while maintaining solution quality. Compared to ICP, NICP reduces the total computational time by 28.6\%, while the objective function value increase is limited to 0.14\%. A transfer learning framework enables efficient extension to various operational constraints, making this a valuable foundation for developing efficient algorithms for truck-drone synchronized routing problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: M...</summary><p>v2: Major revision.

We introduce the first implementation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth method specifically tailored for data-driven AR prediction, leveraging historical derivative information to enhance numerical stability without additional computational overhead. To validate our approach, we systematically evaluate time integration schemes across canonical 2D PDEs before extending to complex Navier-Stokes cylinder vortex shedding dynamics. Additionally, we develop three novel adaptive weighting strategies that dynamically adjust the importance of different future time steps during multi-step rollout training. Our analysis reveals that as physical complexity increases, such sophisticated rollout techniques become essential, with the Adams-Bashforth scheme demonstrating consistent robustness across investigated systems and our best adaptive approach delivering an 89% improvement over conventional fixed-weight methods while maintaining similar computational costs. For the complex Navier-Stokes vortex shedding problem, despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps reducing mean squared error from 0.125 (single-step direct prediction) to 0.002 (Adams-Bashforth with proposed multi-step rollout). Our integrated methodology demonstrates an 83% improvement over standard noise injection techniques and maintains robustness under severe spatial constraints; specifically, when trained on only a partial spatial domain, it still achieves 58% and 27% improvements over direct prediction and forward Euler methods, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Text Semantics and Graph Structures for Temporal Text-attributed Graphs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14411v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have shown remarkable performance in temporal graph modeling. However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich textual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs). Such combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures introduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and rely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural information, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the essential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic reinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \textbf{CROSS}, a flexible framework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. CROSS is designed by decomposing the TTAG modeling process into two phases: (i) temporal semantics extraction; and (ii) semantic-structural information unification. The key idea is to advance the large language models (LLMs) to dynamically extract the temporal semantics in text space and then generate cohesive representations unifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Semantics Extractor in the CROSS framework, which empowers LLMs to offer the temporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual neighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the Semantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for synthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic and structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that CROSS achieves state-of-the-art results on four public datasets and one industrial dataset, with 24.7% absolute MRR gain on average in temporal link prediction and 3.7% AUC gain in node classification of industrial application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Agents cache the most recent samples from others and communicate over wireless collision channels governed by an underlying graph topology. Our goal is to minimize time-average estimation error and/or age of information with decentralized scalable sampling and transmission policies, considering both oblivious (where decision-making is independent of the physical processes) and non-oblivious policies (where decision-making depends on physical processes). We prove that in oblivious policies, minimizing estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the age of information. The complexity of the problem, especially the multi-dimensional action spaces and arbitrary network topologies, makes theoretical methods for finding optimal transmission policies intractable. We optimize the policies using a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, where each agent employs a permutation-equivariant graph neural network architecture. Theoretically, we prove that our proposed framework exhibits desirable transferability properties, allowing transmission policies trained on small- or moderate-size networks to be executed effectively on large-scale topologies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) The trained policies are transferable to larger networks, and their performance gains increase with the number of agents; (iii) The training procedure withstands non-stationarity even if we utilize independent learning techniques; and, (iv) Recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity in independent learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) Descriptor to Characterize Imaging Heterogeneity in Confounding Tumor Pathologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19258v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant challenge in solid tumors is reliably distinguishing confounding pathologies from malignant neoplasms on routine imaging. While radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI, many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10% improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review: npj Digital Medicine</p></details> |

This step is fundamental for all applications that include a human player, but it remains a mostly unexplored topic in symbolic music processing. In this work, we formalize the problem as a collection of interdependent subtasks, and propose a unified graph neural network (GNN) framework that targets the case of piano music and quantized symbolic input. Our method employs a multi-task GNN to jointly predict voice connections, staff assignments, pitch spelling, key signature, stem direction, octave shifts, and clef signs. A dedicated postprocessing pipeline generates print-ready MusicXML/MEI outputs. Comprehensive evaluation on two diverse piano corpora (J-Pop and DCML Romantic) demonstrates that our unified model achieves good accuracy across all subtasks, compared to existing systems that only specialize in specific subtasks. These results indicate that a shared GNN encoder with lightweight task-specific decoders in a multi-task setting offers a scalable and effective solution for automatic music engraving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Conference on Technologies for Music Notation and Representation (TENOR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Networks with Similarity-Navigated Probabilistic Feature Copying](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19084v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various graph-based tasks. However, they face some fundamental limitations: feature oversmoothing can cause node representations to become indistinguishable in deeper networks, they struggle to effectively manage heterogeneous relationships where connected nodes differ significantly, and they process entire feature vectors as indivisible units, which limits flexibility. We seek to address these limitations. We propose AxelGNN, a novel GNN architecture inspired by Axelrod's cultural dissemination model that addresses these limitations through a unified framework. AxelGNN incorporates similarity-gated probabilistic interactions that adaptively promote convergence or divergence based on node similarity, implements trait-level copying mechanisms for fine-grained feature aggregation at the segment level, and maintains global polarization to preserve node distinctiveness across multiple representation clusters. The model's bistable convergence dynamics naturally handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs within a single architecture. Extensive experiments on node classification and influence estimation benchmarks demonstrate that AxelGNN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNN methods across diverse graph structures with varying homophily-heterophily characteristics.</p></details> |  |

Traditional physics-based models face scalability challenges and are computationally demanding, while data-driven approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often lack physical consistency, interpretability, and generalization. In this paper, we propose Dynami-CAL GraphNet, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network that integrates the learning capabilities of GNNs with physics-based inductive biases to address these limitations. Dynami-CAL GraphNet enforces pairwise conservation of linear and angular momentum for interacting nodes using edge-local reference frames that are equivariant to rotational symmetries, invariant to translations, and equivariant to node permutations. This design ensures physically consistent predictions of node dynamics while offering interpretable, edge-wise linear and angular impulses resulting from pairwise interactions. Evaluated on a 3D granular system with inelastic collisions, Dynami-CAL GraphNet demonstrates stable error accumulation over extended rollouts, effective extrapolations to unseen configurations, and robust handling of heterogeneous interactions and external forces. Dynami-CAL GraphNet offers significant advantages in fields requiring accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of complex multi-body dynamical systems, such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and materials science. By providing physically consistent and scalable predictions that adhere to fundamental conservation laws, it enables the inference of forces and moments while efficiently handling heterogeneous interactions and external forces.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers. Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark dataset.</p></details> | Under Review |

Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral-domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: New Perspectives in Advancing Graph Machine Learning</p></details> |

Existing methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), mostly focus on static TAGs. Extending these existing methods to DyTAGs is challenging as they largely neglect the recent-global temporal semantics: the recent semantic dependencies among interaction texts and the global semantic evolution of nodes over time. Furthermore, applying LLMs to the abundant and evolving text in DyTAGs faces efficiency issues. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic Global-Recent Adaptive Semantic Processing (DyGRASP), a novel method that leverages LLMs and temporal GNNs to efficiently and effectively reason on DyTAGs. Specifically, we first design a node-centric implicit reasoning method together with a sliding window mechanism to efficiently capture recent temporal semantics. In addition, to capture global semantic dynamics of nodes, we leverage explicit reasoning with tailored prompts and an RNN-like chain structure to infer long-term semantics. Lastly, we intricately integrate the recent and global temporal semantics as well as the dynamic graph structural information using updating and merging layers. Extensive experiments on DyTAG benchmarks demonstrate DyGRASP's superiority, achieving up to 34% improvement in Hit@10 for destination node retrieval task. Besides, DyGRASP exhibits strong generalization across different temporal GNNs and LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to produce structure-aware and task-discriminative representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods.

Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with seven different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 14B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5-Coder.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270v6)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction builds on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes -- namely, the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET -- which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar--Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). Both the $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs adopt a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN), cascading the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation -- akin to local pooling in CNNs -- that can be performed either locally or per scale. Such pooling operations are more difficult to define in traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets and in geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, our approach extracts a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be combined with simple machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification with far fewer trainable parameters than most modern graph neural networks require. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MHSNs on three distinct problem types: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, Comments Welcome</p></details> |

Its clinical and biological heterogeneity makes diagnosis and subtype differentiation highly challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown strong potential in modeling brain connectivity, but their limited robustness, data scarcity, and lack of interpretability constrain clinical adoption. Explainable Graph Neural Networks (XGNNs) have emerged to address these barriers by combining graph-based learning with interpretability, enabling the identification of disease-relevant biomarkers, analysis of brain network disruptions, and provision of transparent insights for clinicians. This paper presents the first comprehensive review dedicated to XGNNs in dementia research. We examine their applications across Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and multi-disease diagnosis. A taxonomy of explainability methods tailored for dementia-related tasks is introduced, alongside comparisons of existing models in clinical scenarios. We also highlight challenges such as limited generalizability, underexplored domains, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) for early detection. By outlining both progress and open problems, this review aims to guide future work toward trustworthy, clinically meaningful, and scalable use of XGNNs in dementia research.</p></details> |  |

Understanding both direct and spillover effects is critical in fields such as epidemiology, political science, and economics. Causal inference on networks faces two main challenges. First, causal effects are typically heterogeneous, varying with unit features and local network structure. Second, connected units often exhibit dependence due to network homophily, creating confounding between structural correlations and causal effects. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method to estimate heterogeneous direct and spillover effects on networks. The first stage uses graph neural networks to estimate nuisance components that depend on the complex network topology. In the second stage, we adjust for network confounding using these estimates and infer causal effects through a novel attention-based interference model. Our approach balances expressiveness and interpretability, enabling downstream tasks such as identifying influential neighborhoods and recovering the sign of spillover effects. We integrate the two stages using Neyman orthogonalization and cross-fitting, which ensures that errors from nuisance estimation contribute only at higher order. As a result, our causal effect estimates are robust to bias and misspecification in modeling causal effects under network dependencies.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogate models for mesh-based data, their standard autoregressive application for long-term prediction is often plagued by error accumulation and instability. To address this, we introduce MeshODENet, a general framework that synergizes the spatial reasoning of GNNs with the continuous-time modeling of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and versatility on a series of challenging structural mechanics problems, including one- and two-dimensional elastic bodies undergoing large, non-linear deformations. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models in long-term predictive accuracy and stability, while achieving substantial computational speed-ups over traditional solvers. This work presents a powerful and generalizable approach for developing data-driven surrogates to accelerate the analysis and modeling of complex structural systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

While local explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation methods, those that characterize an entire class, remain underdeveloped. Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space, exemplars, and explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem over reverse k-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study with 60 participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 20 figures, NeurIPS 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[A Graph-Neural-Network-Entropy model of vital node identification on network attack and propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18325v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vital nodes usually play a key role in complex networks. Uncovering these nodes is an important task in protecting the network, especially when the network suffers intentional attack. Many existing methods have not fully integrated the node feature, interaction and state. In this article, we propose a novel method (GNNE) based on graph neural networks and information entropy. The method employs a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn the nodes' features, which are input into a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to obtain the influence factor of nodes, and the node influence factors are used to calculate the nodes' entropy to evaluate the node importance. The GNNE takes advantage of the GCN and GAT, with the GCN well extracting the nodes' features and the GAT aggregating the features of the nodes' neighbors by using the attention mechanism to assign different weights to the neighbors with different importance, and the nodes' entropy quantifies the nodes' state in the network. The proposed method is trained on a synthetic Barabasi-Albert network, and tested on six real datasets. Compared with eight traditional topology-based methods and four graph-machine-learning-based methods, the GNNE shows an advantage for the vital node identification in the perspectives of network attack and propagation.</p></details> |  |

However,computational approaches rarely model handshapes explicitly, limiting both recognition accuracy and linguistic analysis.We introduce a novel graph neural network that separates temporal dynamics from static handshape configurations. Our approach combines anatomically-informed graph structures with contrastive learning to address key challenges in handshape recognition, including subtle interclass distinctions and temporal variations. We establish the first benchmark for structured handshape recognition in signing sequences, achieving 46% accuracy across 37 handshape classes (with baseline methods achieving 25%).</p></details> |  |
| **[Budgeted Adversarial Attack against Graph-Based Anomaly Detection in Sensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17987v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for anomaly detection in sensor networks, particularly when analyzing multivariate time series. In this work, we introduce BETA, a novel grey-box evasion attack targeting such GNN-based detectors, where the attacker is constrained to perturb sensor readings from a limited set of nodes, excluding the target sensor, with the goal of either suppressing a true anomaly or triggering a false alarm at the target node. BETA identifies the sensors most influential to the target node's classification and injects carefully crafted adversarial perturbations into their features, all while maintaining stealth and respecting the attacker's budget. Experiments on three real-world sensor network datasets show that BETA reduces the detection accuracy of state-of-the-art GNN-based detectors by 30.62 to 39.16% on average, and significantly outperforms baseline attack strategies, while operating within realistic constraints.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Interpreting Graph Inference with Skyline Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07635v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference queries have been routinely issued to graph machine learning models such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for various network analytical tasks. Nevertheless, GNN outputs are often hard to interpret comprehensively. Existing methods typically conform to individual pre-defined explainability measures (such as fidelity), which often leads to biased, ``one-side'' interpretations. This paper introduces skyline explanation, a new paradigm that interprets GNN outputs by simultaneously optimizing multiple explainability measures of users' interests. (1) We propose skyline explanations as a Pareto set of explanatory subgraphs that dominate others over multiple explanatory measures. We formulate skyline explanation as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and establish its hardness results. (2) We design efficient algorithms with an onion-peeling approach, which strategically prioritizes nodes and removes unpromising edges to incrementally assemble skyline explanations. (3) We also develop an algorithm to diversify the skyline explanations to enrich the comprehensive interpretation. (4) We introduce efficient parallel algorithms with load-balancing strategies to scale skyline explanation for large-scale GNN-based inference. Using real-world and synthetic graphs, we experimentally verify our algorithms' effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpreting GNN-based IDS Detections Using Provenance Graph Structural Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00934v6)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced cyber threats (e.g., Fileless Malware and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)) have driven the adoption of provenance-based security solutions. These solutions employ Machine Learning (ML) models for behavioral modeling and critical security tasks such as malware and anomaly detection. However, the opacity of ML-based security models limits their broader adoption, as the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes restricts explainability and verifiability. We tailored our solution towards Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based security solutions since recent studies employ GNNs to comprehensively digest system provenance graphs for security-critical tasks. To enhance the explainability of GNN-based security models, we introduce PROVEXPLAINER, a framework offering instance-level security-aware explanations using an interpretable surrogate model. PROVEXPLAINER's interpretable feature space consists of discriminant subgraph patterns and graph structural features, which can be directly mapped to the system provenance problem space, making the explanations human interpretable. We show how PROVEXPLAINER synergizes with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN explainers to deliver domain and instance-specific explanations. We measure the explanation quality using the Fidelity+/Fidelity- metric as used by traditional GNN explanation literature, we incorporate the precision/recall metric, where we consider the accuracy of the explanation against the ground truth, and we designed a human actionability metric based on graph traversal distance. On real-world Fileless and APT datasets, PROVEXPLAINER achieves up to 29%/27%/25%/1.4x higher Fidelity+, precision, recall, and actionability (where higher values are better), and 12% lower Fidelity- (where lower values are better) when compared against SOTA GNN explainers.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScaleGNN: Towards Scalable Graph Neural Networks via Adaptive High-order Neighboring Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15920v5)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance across diverse graph-based tasks by leveraging message passing to capture complex node relationships. However, when applied to large-scale real-world graphs, GNNs face two major challenges: First, it becomes increasingly difficult to ensure both scalability and efficiency, as the repeated aggregation of large neighborhoods leads to significant computational overhead; Second, the over-smoothing problem arises, where excessive or deep propagation makes node representations indistinguishable, severely hindering model expressiveness. To tackle these issues, we propose ScaleGNN, a novel framework that adaptively fuses multi-hop node features for both scalable and effective graph learning. First, we construct per-hop pure neighbor matrices that capture only the exclusive structural information at each hop, avoiding the redundancy of conventional aggregation. Then, an enhanced feature fusion strategy significantly balances low-order and high-order information, preserving both local detail and global correlations without incurring excessive complexity. To further reduce redundancy and over-smoothing, we introduce a Local Contribution Score (LCS)-based masking mechanism to filter out less relevant high-order neighbors, ensuring that only the most meaningful information is aggregated. In addition, learnable sparse constraints selectively integrate multi-hop valuable features, emphasizing the most informative high-order neighbors. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ScaleGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, highlighting its practical value for large-scale graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[FastNet: Improving the physical consistency of machine-learning weather prediction models through loss function design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17601v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) models have demonstrated remarkable potential in delivering accurate forecasts at significantly reduced computational cost compared to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. However, challenges remain in ensuring the physical consistency of MLWP outputs, particularly in deterministic settings. This study presents FastNet, a graph neural network (GNN)-based global prediction model, and investigates the impact of alternative loss function designs on improving the physical realism of its forecasts. We explore three key modifications to the standard mean squared error (MSE) loss: (1) a modified spherical harmonic (MSH) loss that penalises spectral amplitude errors to reduce blurring and enhance small-scale structure retention; (2) inclusion of horizontal gradient terms in the loss to suppress non-physical artefacts; and (3) an alternative wind representation that decouples speed and direction to better capture extreme wind events. Results show that while the MSH and gradient-based losses \textit{alone} may slightly degrade RMSE scores, when trained in combination the model exhibits very similar MSE performance to an MSE-trained model while at the same time significantly improving spectral fidelity and physical consistency. The alternative wind representation further improves wind speed accuracy and reduces directional bias. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of loss function design as a mechanism for embedding domain knowledge into MLWP models and advancing their operational readiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Periodic Graph-Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17472v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection commonly encounters in various domains like finance, healthcare, and industrial monitoring. However, existing MTS anomaly detection methods are mostly defined on the static graph structure, which fails to perform an accurate representation of complex spatio-temporal correlations in MTS. To address this issue, this study proposes a Periodic Graph-Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detector (PGMA) with the following two-fold ideas: a) designing a periodic time-slot allocation strategy based Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which enables the graph structure to reflect dynamic changes in MTS; b) utilizing graph neural network and temporal extension convolution to accurate extract the complex spatio-temporal correlations from the reconstructed periodic graphs. Experiments on four real datasets from real applications demonstrate that the proposed PGMA outperforms state-of-the-art models in MTS anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preserving Node-level Privacy in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06888v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential privacy (DP) has seen immense applications in learning on tabular, image, and sequential data where instance-level privacy is concerned. In learning on graphs, contrastingly, works on node-level privacy are highly sparse. Challenges arise as existing DP protocols hardly apply to the message-passing mechanism in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this study, we propose a solution that specifically addresses the issue of node-level privacy. Our protocol consists of two main components: 1) a sampling routine called HeterPoisson, which employs a specialized node sampling strategy and a series of tailored operations to generate a batch of sub-graphs with desired properties, and 2) a randomization routine that utilizes symmetric multivariate Laplace (SML) noise instead of the commonly used Gaussian noise. Our privacy accounting shows this particular combination provides a non-trivial privacy guarantee. In addition, our protocol enables GNN learning with good performance, as demonstrated by experiments on five real-world datasets; compared with existing baselines, our method shows significant advantages, especially in the high privacy regime. Experimentally, we also 1) perform membership inference attacks against our protocol and 2) apply privacy audit techniques to confirm our protocol's privacy integrity. In the sequel, we present a study on a seemingly appealing approach \cite{sajadmanesh2023gap} (USENIX'23) that protects node-level privacy via differentially private node/instance embeddings. Unfortunately, such work has fundamental privacy flaws, which are identified through a thorough case study. More importantly, we prove an impossibility result of achieving both (strong) privacy and (acceptable) utility through private instance embedding. The implication is that such an approach has intrinsic utility barriers when enforcing differential privacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphTorque: Torque-Driven Rewiring Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21422v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process, motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to improve representation learning in heterophilous and homophilous graphs. Specifically, we define the torque by treating the feature distance as a lever arm vector and the neighbor feature as a force vector weighted by the homophily disparity between nodes. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing the impact of irrelevant information and boosting pertinent signals during message passing. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art rewiring methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs.</p></details> |  |

The architecture learns node features at different resolutions with skip connections between the encoder and decoder paths, analogous to the convolutional U-Net for image generation. The U-GNN is prominent for a pooling operation that leverages zero-padding and avoids arbitrary graph coarsening, with graph convolutions layered on top to capture local dependencies. This technique permits learning feature embeddings for sampled nodes at deeper levels of the architecture that remain convolutional with respect to the original graph. Applied to stock price prediction -- where deterministic forecasts struggle to capture uncertainties and tail events that are paramount -- we demonstrate the effectiveness of the diffusion model in probabilistic forecasting of stock prices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2026)</p></details> |

Recent advances in multivariate time series anomaly detection (TSAD) have increasingly leveraged graph structures to model inter-variable relationships, typically employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Despite their promising results, existing methods often rely on a single graph representation, which are insufficient for capturing the complex, diverse relationships inherent in multivariate time series. To address this, we propose the Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion (PMGC) framework for multivariate TSAD. PMGC exploits spatial correlations by integrating a long-term static graph with a series of short-term instance-wise dynamic graphs, regulated through a graph cohesion loss function. Our theoretical analysis shows that this loss function promotes diversity among dynamic graphs while aligning them with the stable long-term relationships encapsulated by the static graph. Additionally, we introduce a "prospective graphing" strategy to mitigate the limitations of traditional forecasting-based TSAD methods, which often struggle with unpredictable future variations. This strategy allows the model to accurately reflect concurrent inter-series relationships under normal conditions, thereby enhancing anomaly detection efficacy. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing TSAD techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 18th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (ACM WSDM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[A Scalable Multi-Robot Framework for Decentralized and Asynchronous Perception-Action-Communication Loops](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10164v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaboration in large robot swarms to achieve a common global objective is a challenging problem in large environments due to limited sensing and communication capabilities. The robots must execute a Perception-Action-Communication (PAC) loop -- they perceive their local environment, communicate with other robots, and take actions in real time. A fundamental challenge in decentralized PAC systems is to decide what information to communicate with the neighboring robots and how to take actions while utilizing the information shared by the neighbors. Recently, this has been addressed using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for applications such as flocking and coverage control. Although conceptually, GNN policies are fully decentralized, the evaluation and deployment of such policies have primarily remained centralized or restrictively decentralized. Furthermore, existing frameworks assume sequential execution of perception and action inference, which is very restrictive in real-world applications. This paper proposes a framework for asynchronous PAC in robot swarms, where decentralized GNNs are used to compute navigation actions and generate messages for communication. In particular, we use aggregated GNNs, which enable the exchange of hidden layer information between robots for computational efficiency and decentralized inference of actions. Furthermore, the modules in the framework are asynchronous, allowing robots to perform sensing, extracting information, communication, action inference, and control execution at different frequencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNs executed in the proposed framework in navigating large robot swarms for collaborative coverage of large environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expressive Power of Graph Neural Networks for (Mixed-Integer) Quadratic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05938v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadratic programming (QP) is the most widely applied category of problems in nonlinear programming. Many applications require real-time/fast solutions, though not necessarily with high precision. Existing methods either involve matrix decomposition or use the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. For relatively large instances, these methods cannot achieve the real-time requirement unless there is an effective preconditioner. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) opened new possibilities for QP. Some promising empirical studies of applying GNNs for QP tasks show that GNNs can capture key characteristics of an optimization instance and provide adaptive guidance accordingly to crucial configurations during the solving process, or directly provide an approximate solution. However, the theoretical understanding of GNNs in this context remains limited. Specifically, it is unclear what GNNs can and cannot achieve for QP tasks in theory. This work addresses this gap in the context of linearly constrained QP tasks. In the continuous setting, we prove that message-passing GNNs can universally represent fundamental properties of convex quadratic programs, including feasibility, optimal objective values, and optimal solutions. In the more challenging mixed-integer setting, while GNNs are not universal approximators, we identify a subclass of QP problems that GNNs can reliably represent.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a graph-based neural inference model that simultaneously predicts neural activity and infers latent connectivity by modeling neurons as interacting nodes in a graph. The architecture features two distinct modules: one for learning structural connectivity and another for predicting future spiking activity via a graph neural network (GNN). Our model accommodates unobserved neurons through auxiliary nodes, allowing for inference in partially observed circuits. We evaluate this approach using synthetic data from ring attractor networks and real spike recordings from head direction cells in mice. Across a wide range of conditions, including varying recurrent connectivity, external inputs, and incomplete observations, our model consistently outperforms standard baselines, resolving spurious correlations more effectively and recovering accurate weight profiles. When applied to real data, the inferred connectivity aligns with theoretical predictions of continuous attractor models. These results highlight the potential of GNN-based models to infer latent neural circuitry through self-supervised structure learning, while leveraging the spike prediction task to flexibly link connectivity and dynamics across both simulated and biological neural systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The two networks interact with each other at the layer level to find a saddle point of the Lagrangian. The primal GNN finds a stationary point for a given dual multiplier, while the dual network iteratively refines its estimates to reach an optimal solution. We force the primal and dual networks to mirror the dynamics of the DA algorithm by imposing descent and ascent constraints. We propose a joint training scheme that alternates between updating the primal and dual networks. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach yields near-optimal near-feasible solutions and generalizes well to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepEOSNet: Capturing the dependency on thermodynamic state in property prediction tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17018v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a machine learning (ML) architecture to better capture the dependency of thermodynamic properties on the independent states. When predicting state-dependent thermodynamic properties, ML models need to account for both molecular structure and the thermodynamic state, described by independent variables, typically temperature, pressure, and composition. Modern molecular ML models typically include state information by adding it to molecular fingerprint vectors or by embedding explicit (semi-empirical) thermodynamic relations. Here, we propose to rather split the information processing on the molecular structure and the dependency on states into two separate network channels: a graph neural network and a multilayer perceptron, whose output is combined by a dot product. We refer to our approach as DeepEOSNet, as this idea is based on the DeepONet architecture [Lu et al. (2021), Nat. Mach. Intell.]: instead of operators, we learn state dependencies, with the possibility to predict equation of states (EOS). We investigate the predictive performance of DeepEOSNet by means of three case studies, which include the prediction of vapor pressure as a function of temperature, and mixture molar volume as a function of composition, temperature, and pressure. Our results show superior performance of DeepEOSNet for predicting vapor pressure and comparable performance for predicting mixture molar volume compared to state-of-research graph-based thermodynamic prediction models from our earlier works. In fact, we see large potential of DeepEOSNet in cases where data is sparse in the state domain and the output function is structurally similar across different molecules. The concept of DeepEOSNet can easily be transferred to other ML architectures in molecular context, and thus provides a viable option for property prediction.</p></details> |  |

We integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) together. Firstly, we apply NLP on the user-generated text and conduct semantic analysis, sentiment recognition and keyword extraction to get subtle risk signals from social media posts. Meanwhile, we build a heterogeneous user relationship graph based on social interaction and propose a novel relational graph convolutional network to model user relationship, attention relationship and content dissemination path to discover some important structural information and user behaviors. Finally, we combine textual features extracted from these two models above with graph structural information, which provides a more robust and effective way to discover at-risk users. Our experiments on real social media datasets from different platforms show that our model can achieve significant improvement over single-modality methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tighter Bounds for Personalized PageRank](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14462v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Personalized PageRank (PPR), where for nodes $s,t$ in a graph $G$, $\pi(s,t)$ is the probability that an $\alpha$-decay random walk from $s$ ends at $t$. Two key queries are: Single-Source PPR (SSPPR), computing $\pi(s,\cdot)$ for fixed $s$, and Single-Target PPR (STPPR), computing $\pi(\cdot,t)$ for fixed $t$. SSPPR is studied under absolute error (SSPPR-A), requiring $|\hat{\pi}(s,t)-\pi(s,t)|\le \epsilon$, and relative error (SSPPR-R), requiring $|\hat{\pi}(s,t)-\pi(s,t)|\le c\pi(s,t)$ for $t$ with $\pi(s,t)\ge \delta$; STPPR adopts the same relative criterion. These queries support web search, recommendation, sparsification, and graph neural networks. The best known upper bounds are $O(\min(\tfrac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\epsilon^{2}},\tfrac{\sqrt{m\log n}}{\epsilon},m\log\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}))$ for SSPPR-A and $O(\min(\tfrac{\log(1/\delta)}{\delta},\sqrt{\tfrac{m\log n}{\delta}},m\log\tfrac{\log n}{\delta m}))$ for SSPPR-R, while lower bounds remain $\Omega(\min(n,1/\epsilon))$, $\Omega(\min(m,1/\delta))$, and $\Omega(\min(n,1/\delta))$, leaving large gaps. We close these gaps by (i) presenting a Monte Carlo algorithm that tightens the SSPPR-A upper bound to $O(1/\epsilon^{2})$, and (ii) proving, via an arc-centric construction, lower bounds $\Omega(\min(m,\tfrac{\log(1/\delta)}{\delta}))$ for SSPPR-R, $\Omega(\min(m,\tfrac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}))$ (and intermediate $\Omega(\min(m,\tfrac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\epsilon}))$) for SSPPR-A, and $\Omega(\min(m,\tfrac{n}{\delta}\log n))$ for STPPR. For practical settings ($\delta=\Theta(1/n)$, $\epsilon=\Theta(n^{-1/2})$, $m\in\Omega(n\log n)$) these bounds meet the best known upper bounds, establishing the optimality of Monte Carlo and FORA for SSPPR-R, our algorithm for SSPPR-A, and RBS for STPPR, and yielding a near-complete complexity landscape for PPR queries.</p></details> | 43 pages |

However, current methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address challenges in olfactory navigation, we introduce a multimodal olfaction dataset along with a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines. This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and training methods, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors, enabling them to detect more compounds and inform better hardware design.

| **[Efficient Transition State Searches by Freezing String Method with Graph Neural Network Potentials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06159v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transition state (TS) searches are a critical bottleneck in computational studies of chemical reactivity, as accurately capturing complex phenomena like bond breaking and formation events requires repeated evaluations of expensive ab-initio potential energy surfaces (PESs). While numerous algorithms have been developed to locate TSs efficiently, the computational cost of PES evaluations remains a key limitation. In this work, we develop and fine-tune a graph neural network (GNN) PES to accelerate TS searches for organic reactions. Our GNN of choice, SchNet, is first pre-trained on the ANI-1 dataset and subsequently fine-tuned on a small dataset of reactant, product, and TS structures. We integrate this GNN PES into the Freezing String Method (FSM), enabling rapid generation of TS guess geometries. Across a benchmark suite of chemically diverse reactions, our fine-tuned model (GNN-FT) achieves a 100% success rate, locating the reference TSs in all cases while reducing the number of ab-initio calculations by 72% on average compared to conventional DFT-based FSM searches. Fine-tuning reduces GNN-FT errors by orders of magnitude for out-of-distribution cases such as non-covalent interactions, and improves TS-region predictions with comparatively little data. Analysis of transition state geometries and energy errors shows that GNN-FT captures PES along the reaction coordinate with sufficient accuracy to serve as a reliable DFT surrogate. These results demonstrate that modern GNN potentials, when properly trained, can significantly reduce the cost of TS searches and broaden the scope and size of systems considered in chemical reactivity studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[TF-DWGNet: A Directed Weighted Graph Neural Network with Tensor Fusion for Multi-Omics Cancer Subtype Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16301v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integration and analysis of multi-omics data provide valuable insights for cancer subtype classification. However, such data are inherently heterogeneous, high-dimensional, and exhibit complex intra- and inter-modality dependencies. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer powerful tools for modeling such structure. Yet, most existing methods rely on prior knowledge or predefined similarity networks to construct graphs, which are often undirected or unweighted, failing to capture the directionality and strength of biological interactions. Interpretability at both the modality and feature levels also remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose TF-DWGNet, a novel Graph Neural Network framework that combines tree-based Directed Weighted graph construction with Tensor Fusion for multiclass cancer subtype classification. TF-DWGNet introduces two key innovations: a supervised tree-based approach for constructing directed, weighted graphs tailored to each omics modality, and a tensor fusion mechanism that captures unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal interactions using low-rank decomposition for efficiency. TF-DWGNet enables modality-specific representation learning, joint embedding fusion, and interpretable subtype prediction. Experiments on real-world cancer datasets show that TF-DWGNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics and statistical tests. Moreover, it provides biologically meaningful insights by ranking influential features and modalities. These results highlight TF-DWGNet's potential for effective and interpretable multi-omics integration in cancer research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Compose by Focus: Scene Graph-based Atomic Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16053v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key requirement for generalist robots is compositional generalization - the ability to combine atomic skills to solve complex, long-horizon tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on synthesizing a planner that sequences pre-learned skills, robust execution of the individual skills themselves remains challenging, as visuomotor policies often fail under distribution shifts induced by scene composition. To address this, we introduce a scene graph-based representation that focuses on task-relevant objects and relations, thereby mitigating sensitivity to irrelevant variation. Building on this idea, we develop a scene-graph skill learning framework that integrates graph neural networks with diffusion-based imitation learning, and further combine "focused" scene-graph skills with a vision-language model (VLM) based task planner. Experiments in both simulation and real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate substantially higher success rates than state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting improved robustness and compositional generalization in long-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Schreier-Coset Graph Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10392v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework for learning over graph-structured data, yet their expressive capacity is often hindered by over-squashing, wherein information from distant nodes is compressed into fixed-size vectors. Existing solutions, including graph rewiring and bottleneck-resistant architectures such as Cayley and expander graphs, avoid this problem but introduce scalability bottlenecks. In particular, the Cayley graphs constructed over $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ exhibit strong theoretical properties, yet suffer from cubic node growth $O(n^3)$, leading to high memory usage. To address this, this work introduces Schrier-Coset Graph Propagation (SCGP), a group-theoretic augmentation method that enriches node features through Schreier-coset embeddings without altering the input graph topology. SCGP embeds bottleneck-free connectivity patterns into a compact feature space, improving long-range message passing while maintaining computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations across standard node and graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that SCGP achieves performance comparable to, or exceeding, expander graph and rewired GNN baselines. Furthermore, SCGP exhibits particular advantages in processing hierarchical and modular graph structures, offering reduced inference latency, improved scalability, and a low memory footprint, making it suitable for real-time and resource-constrained applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been updated and now utilizes a more comprehensive methodology, we felt that the name does not do justice to it as their is no graph rewiring involved.

Open in-situ datasets from principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual annotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage often leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep learning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address this issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically coherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a minimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain underexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially in the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address this gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for systematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale land cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both input-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation by postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models. Additionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to improve performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff between accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our results show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps. Input-level aggregation proves more robust on smaller datasets, whereas output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several configurations of LC-SLab also outperform existing land cover products, highlighting the framework's practical utility.</p></details> |  |

However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather prediction service.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Optimize Capacity Planning in Semiconductor Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15767v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In manufacturing, capacity planning is the process of allocating production resources in accordance with variable demand. The current industry practice in semiconductor manufacturing typically applies heuristic rules to prioritize actions, such as future change lists that account for incoming machine and recipe dedications. However, while offering interpretability, heuristics cannot easily account for the complex interactions along the process flow that can gradually lead to the formation of bottlenecks. Here, we present a neural network-based model for capacity planning on the level of individual machines, trained using deep reinforcement learning. By representing the policy using a heterogeneous graph neural network, the model directly captures the diverse relationships among machines and processing steps, allowing for proactive decision-making. We describe several measures taken to achieve sufficient scalability to tackle the vast space of possible machine-level actions. Our evaluation results cover Intel's small-scale Minifab model and preliminary experiments using the popular SMT2020 testbed. In the largest tested scenario, our trained policy increases throughput and decreases cycle time by about 1.8% each.</p></details> |  |

It employs an online data quality monitoring (DQM) system to promptly spot and diagnose particle data acquisition problems to avoid data quality loss. In this study, we present a semi-supervised spatio-temporal anomaly detection (AD) monitoring system for the physics particle reading channels of the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) of the CMS using three-dimensional digi-occupancy map data of the DQM. We propose the GraphSTAD system, which employs convolutional and graph neural networks to learn local spatial characteristics induced by particles traversing the detector and the global behavior owing to shared backend circuit connections and housing boxes of the channels, respectively. Recurrent neural networks capture the temporal evolution of the extracted spatial features. We validate the accuracy of the proposed AD system in capturing diverse channel fault types using the LHC collision data sets. The GraphSTAD system achieves production-level accuracy and is being integrated into the CMS core production system for real-time monitoring of the HCAL. We provide a quantitative performance comparison with alternative benchmark models to demonstrate the promising leverage of the presented system.

| **[DiRW: Path-Aware Digraph Learning for Heterophily](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10320v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has emerged as a powerful representation learning tool for graph-structured data. However, most approaches are tailored for undirected graphs, neglecting the abundant information in the edges of directed graphs (digraphs). In fact, digraphs are widely applied in the real world and confirmed to address heterophily challenges. Despite recent advancements, existing spatial- and spectral-based DiGNNs have limitations due to their complex learning mechanisms and reliance on high-quality topology, resulting in low efficiency and unstable performance. To address these issues, we propose Directed Random Walk (DiRW), a plug-and-play strategy for most spatial-based DiGNNs and also an innovative model which offers a new digraph learning paradigm. Specifically, it utilizes a direction-aware path sampler optimized from the perspectives of walk probability, length, and number in a weight-free manner by considering node profiles and topologies. Building upon this, DiRW incorporates a node-wise learnable path aggregator for generalized node representations. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that DiRW: (1) enhances most spatial-based methods as a plug-and-play strategy; (2) achieves SOTA performance as a new digraph learning paradigm. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/dhsiuu/DiRW.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Network-assisted Random Forest+](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15611v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning algorithms often assume that training samples are independent. When data points are connected by a network, the induced dependency between samples is both a challenge, reducing effective sample size, and an opportunity to improve prediction by leveraging information from network neighbors. Multiple methods taking advantage of this opportunity are now available, but many, including graph neural networks, are not easily interpretable, limiting their usefulness for understanding how a model makes its predictions. Others, such as network-assisted linear regression, are interpretable but often yield substantially worse prediction performance. We bridge this gap by proposing a family of flexible network-assisted models built upon a generalization of random forests (RF+), which achieves highly-competitive prediction accuracy and can be interpreted through feature importance measures. In particular, we develop a suite of interpretation tools that enable practitioners to not only identify important features that drive model predictions, but also quantify the importance of the network contribution to prediction. Importantly, we provide both global and local importance measures as well as sample influence measures to assess the impact of a given observation. This suite of tools broadens the scope and applicability of network-assisted machine learning for high-impact problems where interpretability and transparency are essential.</p></details> |  |

We present SolarCAST, a causally informed model predicting future global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a target site using only historical GHI from site X and nearby stations S - unlike prior work that relies on sky-camera or satellite imagery requiring specialized hardware and heavy preprocessing. To deliver high accuracy with only public sensor data, SolarCAST models three classes of confounding factors behind X-S correlations using scalable neural components: (i) observable synchronous variables (e.g., time of day, station identity), handled via an embedding module; (ii) latent synchronous factors (e.g., regional weather patterns), captured by a spatio-temporal graph neural network; and (iii) time-lagged influences (e.g., cloud movement across stations), modeled with a gated transformer that learns temporal shifts. It outperforms leading time-series and multimodal baselines across diverse geographical conditions, and achieves a 25.9% error reduction over the top commercial forecaster, Solcast. SolarCAST offers a lightweight, practical, and generalizable solution for localized solar forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2025</p></details> |

To address this, model-level interpretation methods have been developed to explain what patterns maximize probability of predicting to a certain class. However, existing model-level interpretation methods pose several limitations such as generating invalid explanation graphs and lacking reliability. In this paper, we propose a new Generative Interpretation Network for Model-Level Explanation of Graph Neural Networks (GIN-Graph), to generate reliable and high-quality model-level explanation graphs. The implicit and likelihood-free generative adversarial networks are exploited to construct the explanation graphs which are similar to original graphs, meanwhile maximizing the prediction probability for a certain class by adopting a novel objective function for generator with dynamic loss weight scheme. Experimental results indicate that GIN-Graph can be applied to interpret GNNs trained on a variety of graph datasets and generate high-quality explanation graphs with high stability and reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural-Spectral Graph Convolution with Evidential Edge Learning for Hyperspectral Image Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09920v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering assigns similar pixels to the same class without any annotations, which is an important yet challenging task. For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/jhqi/SSGCO-EGAEL.</p></details> |  |

However, their application to graph structured data, where capturing topological connections is essential, remains underexplored and underperforming compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly in the graph clustering task. GNN tends to overemphasize neighborhood aggregation, leading to a homogenization of node representations. Conversely, Transformer tends to over globalize, highlighting distant nodes at the expense of meaningful local patterns. This dichotomy raises a key question: Is attention inherently redundant for unsupervised graph learning? To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, uncovering the complementary weaknesses of GNN and Transformer in graph clustering. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN) a novel architecture that reinterprets the notion that graph is attention. AGCN directly embeds the attention mechanism into the graph structure, enabling effective global information extraction while maintaining sensitivity to local topological cues. Our framework incorporates theoretical analysis to contrast AGCN behavior with GNN and Transformer and introduces two innovations: (1) a KV cache mechanism to improve computational efficiency, and (2) a pairwise margin contrastive loss to boost the discriminative capacity of the attention space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

To solve this problem, exact solution methods based on column generation have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel partial column generation strategy for settings with multiple pricing problems, based on predicting which ones are likely to yield columns with a negative reduced cost. We develop a machine learning model tailored to the team formation and routing problem that leverages graph neural networks for these predictions. Computational experiments demonstrate that applying our strategy enhances the solution method and outperforms traditional partial column generation approaches from the literature, particularly on hard instances solved under a tight time limit.</p></details> | 30 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Exploring the Global-to-Local Attention Scheme in Graph Transformers: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14863v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) show considerable potential in graph representation learning. The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer, featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping linear complexity.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.</p></details> |  |
