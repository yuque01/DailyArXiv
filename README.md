| **[Average Precision at Cutoff k under Random Rankings: Expectation and Variance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02571v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems and information retrieval platforms rely on ranking algorithms to present the most relevant items to users, thereby improving engagement and satisfaction. Assessing the quality of these rankings requires reliable evaluation metrics. Among them, Mean Average Precision at cutoff k (MAP@k) is widely used, as it accounts for both the relevance of items and their positions in the list. In this paper, the expectation and variance of Average Precision at k (AP@k) are derived since they can be used as biselines for MAP@k. Here, we covered two widely used evaluation models: offline and online. The expectation establishes the baseline, indicating the level of MAP@k that can be achieved by pure chance. The variance complements this baseline by quantifying the extent of random fluctuations, enabling a more reliable interpretation of observed scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Generative Recommendation with Continuous Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12007v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhancing recommender systems (RecSys). Most existing LLM-based RecSys approaches operate in a discrete space, using vector-quantized tokenizers to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, these quantization methods often result in lossy tokenization and suboptimal learning, primarily due to inaccurate gradient propagation caused by the non-differentiable argmin operation in standard vector quantization. Inspired by the emerging trend of embracing continuous tokens in language models, we propose ContRec, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates continuous tokens into LLM-based RecSys. Specifically, ContRec consists of two key modules: a sigma-VAE Tokenizer, which encodes users/items with continuous tokens; and a Dispersive Diffusion module, which captures implicit user preference. The tokenizer is trained with a continuous Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) objective, where three effective techniques are adopted to avoid representation collapse. By conditioning on the previously generated tokens of the LLM backbone during user modeling, the Dispersive Diffusion module performs a conditional diffusion process with a novel Dispersive Loss, enabling high-quality user preference generation through next-token diffusion. Finally, ContRec leverages both the textual reasoning output from the LLM and the latent representations produced by the diffusion model for Top-K item retrieval, thereby delivering comprehensive recommendation results. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that ContRec consistently outperforms both traditional and SOTA LLM-based recommender systems. Our results highlight the potential of continuous tokenization and generative modeling for advancing the next generation of recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Fast Top-K Selection for Large-Scale Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11472v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity. By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77% revenue lift with the same computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures.

| **[UFGraphFR: Graph Federation Recommendation System based on User Text description features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08044v4)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving framework for recommendation systems by enabling local data processing; however, data localization introduces substantial obstacles. Traditional federated recommendation approaches treat each user as an isolated entity, failing to construct global user relationship graphs that capture collaborative signals, which limits the accuracy of recommendations. To address this limitation, we derive insight from the insight that semantic similarity reflects preference. similarity, which can be used to improve the construction of user relationship graphs. This paper proposes UFGraphFR, a novel framework with three key components: 1) On the client side, private structured data is first transformed into text descriptions. These descriptions are then encoded into semantic vectors using pre-trained models; 2) On the server side, user relationship graphs are securely reconstructed using aggregated model weights without accessing raw data, followed by information propagation through lightweight graph neural networks; 3) On the client side, user behavior sequences are personalized using Transformer architectures. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that UFGraphFR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both recommendation accuracy and personalization. The framework also maintains robustness across different pre-trained models, as evidenced by the consistent performance metrics obtained. This work provides a practical method for efficient federated recommendations with strict privacy by using semantic vectors, secure user relationship graphs, and personalized behavior sequences.

| **[Solving cold start in news recommendations: a RippleNet-based system for large scale media outlet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02052v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a scalable recommender system implementation based on RippleNet, tailored for the media domain with a production deployment in Onet.pl, one of Poland's largest online media platforms. Our solution addresses the cold-start problem for newly published content by integrating content-based item embeddings into the knowledge propagation mechanism of RippleNet, enabling effective scoring of previously unseen items. The system architecture leverages Amazon SageMaker for distributed training and inference, and Apache Airflow for orchestrating data pipelines and model retraining workflows. To ensure high-quality training data, we constructed a comprehensive golden dataset consisting of user and item features and a separate interaction table, all enabling flexible extensions and integration of new signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[HADSF: Aspect Aware Semantic Control for Explainable Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26994v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) promise more effective information extraction for review-based recommender systems, yet current methods still (i) mine free-form reviews without scope control, producing redundant and noisy representations, (ii) lack principled metrics that link LLM hallucination to downstream effectiveness, and (iii) leave the cost-quality trade-off across model scales largely unexplored. We address these gaps with the Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF), a two-stage approach that first induces a compact, corpus-level aspect vocabulary via adaptive selection and then performs vocabulary-guided, explicitly constrained extraction of structured aspect-opinion triples. To assess the fidelity of the resulting representations, we introduce Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion Fidelity Rate (OFR) and empirically uncover a nonmonotonic relationship between hallucination severity and rating prediction error. Experiments on approximately 3 million reviews across LLMs spanning 1.5B-70B parameters show that, when integrated into standard rating predictors, HADSF yields consistent reductions in prediction error and enables smaller models to achieve competitive performance in representative deployment scenarios. We release code, data pipelines, and metric implementations to support reproducible research on hallucination-aware, LLM-enhanced explainable recommendation.

| **[Can Large Language Models Analyze Graphs like Professionals? A Benchmark, Datasets and Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19667v4)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The need to analyze graphs is ubiquitous across various fields, from social networks to biological research and recommendation systems. Therefore, enabling the ability of large language models (LLMs) to process graphs is an important step toward more advanced general intelligence. However, current LLM benchmarks on graph analysis require models to directly reason over the prompts describing graph topology, and are thus limited to small graphs with only a few dozens of nodes. In contrast, human experts typically write programs based on popular libraries for task solving, and can thus handle graphs with different scales. To this end, a question naturally arises: can LLMs analyze graphs like professionals? In this paper, we introduce ProGraph, a manually crafted benchmark containing 3 categories of graph tasks. The benchmark expects solutions based on programming instead of directly reasoning over raw inputs. Our findings reveal that the performance of current LLMs is unsatisfactory, with the best model achieving only 36% accuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose LLM4Graph datasets, which include crawled documents and auto-generated codes based on 6 widely used graph libraries. By augmenting closed-source LLMs with document retrieval and fine-tuning open-source ones on the codes, we show 11-32% absolute improvements in their accuracies. Our results underscore that the capabilities of LLMs in handling structured data are still under-explored, and show the effectiveness of LLM4Graph in enhancing LLMs' proficiency of graph analysis. The benchmark, datasets and enhanced open-source models are available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/ProGraph.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Dynamic Forgetting and Spatio-Temporal Periodic Interest Modeling for Local-Life Service Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02451v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of the booming digital economy, recommendation systems, as a key link connecting users and numerous services, face challenges in modeling user behavior sequences on local-life service platforms, including the sparsity of long sequences and strong spatio-temporal dependence. Such challenges can be addressed by drawing an analogy to the forgetting process in human memory. This is because users' responses to recommended content follow the recency effect and the cyclicality of memory. By exploring this, this paper introduces the forgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM) with long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates three key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve, which is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic spatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that can adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling the collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical multi-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by modeling the hierarchical interactions between the shallow and deep semantics of users' recent behaviors. By introducing the STIM method, we conducted online A/B tests and achieved a 1.54\% improvement in gross transaction volume (GTV). In addition, extended offline experiments also showed improvements. STIM has been deployed in a large-scale local-life service recommendation system, serving hundreds of millions of daily active users in core application scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memory Assisted LLM for Personalized Recommendation System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03824v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in solving recommendation tasks. With proven capabilities in understanding user preferences, LLM personalization has emerged as a critical area for providing tailored responses to individuals. Current studies explore personalization through prompt design and fine-tuning, paving the way for further research in personalized LLMs. However, existing approaches are either costly and inefficient in capturing diverse user preferences or fail to account for timely updates to user history. To address these gaps, we propose the Memory-Assisted Personalized LLM (MAP). Through user interactions, we first create a history profile for each user, capturing their preferences, such as ratings for historical items. During recommendation, we extract relevant memory based on similarity, which is then incorporated into the prompts to enhance personalized recommendations. In our experiments, we define a new task that enables testing with varying memory size under two scenarios: single domain where memory and tasks are from the same category and cross-domain (e.g. memory from movies and recommendation tasks in books). The results show that MAP outperforms regular LLM-based recommenders that integrate user history directly through prompt design. Moreover, as user history grows, MAP's advantage increases in both scenarios, making it more suitable for addressing successive personalized user requests.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Understanding Endogenous Data Drift in Adaptive Models with Recourse-Seeking Users](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09658v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models are widely used in decision-making and recommendation systems, where they typically rely on the assumption of a static data distribution between training and deployment. However, real-world deployment environments often violate this assumption. Users who receive negative outcomes may adapt their features to meet model criteria, i.e., recourse action. These adaptive behaviors create shifts in the data distribution and when models are retrained on this shifted data, a feedback loop emerges: user behavior influences the model, and the updated model in turn reshapes future user behavior. Despite its importance, this bidirectional interaction between users and models has received limited attention. In this work, we develop a general framework to model user strategic behaviors and their interactions with decision-making systems under resource constraints and competitive dynamics. Both the theoretical and empirical analyses show that user recourse behavior tends to push logistic and MLP models toward increasingly higher decision standards, resulting in higher recourse costs and less reliable recourse actions over time. To mitigate these challenges, we propose two methods--Fair-top-k and Dynamic Continual Learning (DCL)--which significantly reduce recourse cost and improve model robustness. Our findings draw connections to economic theories, highlighting how algorithmic decision-making can unintentionally reinforce a higher standard and generate endogenous barriers to entry.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Gated Rotary-Enhanced Linear Attention for Long-term Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13315v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Sequential Recommendation Systems (SRSs), Transformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance but face computational and memory cost challenges, especially when modeling long-term user behavior sequences. Due to its quadratic complexity, the dot-product attention mechanism in Transformers becomes expensive for processing long sequences. By approximating the dot-product attention using elaborate mapping functions, linear attention provides a more efficient option with linear complexity. However, existing linear attention methods face three limitations: 1) they often use learnable position encodings, which incur extra computational costs in long-term sequence scenarios, 2) they may not sufficiently account for user's fine-grained local preferences (short-lived burst of interest), and 3) they try to capture some temporary activities, but often confuse these with stable and long-term interests. This can result in unclear or less effective recommendations. To remedy these drawbacks, we propose a long-term sequential Recommendation model with Gated Rotary Enhanced Linear Attention (RecGRELA). Specifically, we first propose a Rotary-Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA) module to efficiently model long-range dependency within the user's historical information using rotary position encodings. Then, we introduce a local short operation to add the local preferences of interactions and show the theoretical insight. We further introduce a SiLU-based Gated mechanism for RELA (GRELA) to help the model tell if a user behavior shows a short-term, local interest or a real change in their long-term tastes. Experimental results on four public benchmark datasets show that our RecGRELA achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing SRSs based on Recurrent Neural Networks, Transformer, and Mamba while keeping low memory overhead.</p></details> | 14 pages,9 figures |
| **[Controlling Gender Bias in Retrieval via a Backpack Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00875v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The presence of social biases in large language models (LLMs) has become a significant concern in AI research. These biases, often embedded in training data, can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and distort decision-making processes. When LLMs are integrated into ranking systems, they can propagate these biases, leading to unfair outcomes in critical applications such as search engines and recommendation systems. Backpack Language Models, unlike traditional transformer-based models that treat text sequences as monolithic structures, generate outputs as weighted combinations of non-contextual, learned word aspects, also known as senses. Leveraging this architecture, we propose a framework for debiasing ranking tasks. Our experimental results show that this framework effectively mitigates gender bias in text retrieval and ranking with minimal degradation in performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[GrowthHacker: Automated Off-Policy Evaluation Optimization Using Code-Modifying LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00802v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the software industry shifting toward a data-driven culture, online A/B testing is a key tool for evaluating new technologies. However, deploying such experiments requires substantial resources, may negatively impact users, and involves long data collection periods. To address this, \textit{off-policy evaluation (OPE)}, or offline A/B testing, uses logged data to assess technologies and is fundamental in Reinforcement Learning, making it crucial in domains where online testing is costly or risky, such as healthcare, recommender systems, education, dialog systems, and robotics. Despite advances in coding LLMs and agentic AI, little is known about leveraging them to optimize OPE results. We investigate whether LLMs and LLM-based agents can improve OPE performance via code optimization. We propose \textit{GrowthHacker}, a benchmark with agent and baseline methods on large-scale real-world datasets, which iteratively optimizes code, evaluates results, and begins new optimization cycles. We collected datasets, established protocols, implemented baselines for OPE on the Open Bandit Pipeline (OBP)~\cite{saito2021openbanditdatasetpipeline} and Scope-RL~\cite{kiyohara2023scope}, and developed the \textit{two_agent} framework, which reduces system complexity while preserving optimization effectiveness. Results show the two_agent framework achieves 100% reliability and the highest average improvement of 106.7% among positive outcomes. Both two_agent and CrewAI reach 45% success rates, outperforming AutoGen's 34%. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of LLM-based agents as automated "growth hackers" to enhance OPE systems, with implications for scaling data-driven decision-making in production.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structurally Refined Graph Transformer for Multimodal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00584v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation systems utilize various types of information, including images and text, to enhance the effectiveness of recommendations. The key challenge is predicting user purchasing behavior from the available data. Current recommendation models prioritize extracting multimodal information while neglecting the distinction between redundant and valuable data. They also rely heavily on a single semantic framework (e.g., local or global semantics), resulting in an incomplete or biased representation of user preferences, particularly those less expressed in prior interactions. Furthermore, these approaches fail to capture the complex interactions between users and items, limiting the model's ability to meet diverse users. To address these challenges, we present SRGFormer, a structurally optimized multimodal recommendation model. By modifying the transformer for better integration into our model, we capture the overall behavior patterns of users. Then, we enhance structural information by embedding multimodal information into a hypergraph structure to aid in learning the local structures between users and items. Meanwhile, applying self-supervised tasks to user-item collaborative signals enhances the integration of multimodal information, thereby revealing the representational features inherent to the data's modality. Extensive experiments on three public datasets reveal that SRGFormer surpasses previous benchmark models, achieving an average performance improvement of 4.47 percent on the Sports dataset. The code is publicly available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia 2025</p></details> |
| **[OneVision: An End-to-End Generative Framework for Multi-view E-commerce Vision Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05759v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems, follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation. In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and +3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric, generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while simplifying the serving pathway.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some of the online experimental results in the paper are significantly different from the actual results, and need to be re-experimented and revised before submission.

The system first retrieves candidate polymers using language-based similarity and then ranks them using fused multimodal embeddings according to multiple target properties. By leveraging the complementary knowledge encoded in both modalities, PolyRecommender enables efficient retrieval and robust ranking across related polymer properties. Our work establishes a generalizable multimodal paradigm, advancing AI-guided design for the discovery of next-generation polymers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effectiveness of LLMs in Temporal User Profiling for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00176v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively modeling the dynamic nature of user preferences is crucial for enhancing recommendation accuracy and fostering transparency in recommender systems. Traditional user profiling often overlooks the distinction between transitory short-term interests and stable long-term preferences. This paper examines the capability of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to capture these temporal dynamics, generating richer user representations through distinct short-term and long-term textual summaries of interaction histories. Our observations suggest that while LLMs tend to improve recommendation quality in domains with more active user engagement, their benefits appear less pronounced in sparser environments. This disparity likely stems from the varying distinguishability of short-term and long-term preferences across domains; the approach shows greater utility where these temporal interests are more clearly separable (e.g., Movies\&TV) compared to domains with more stable user profiles (e.g., Video Games). This highlights a critical trade-off between enhanced performance and computational costs, suggesting context-dependent LLM application. Beyond predictive capability, this LLM-driven approach inherently provides an intrinsic potential for interpretability through its natural language profiles and attention weights. This work contributes insights into the practical capability and inherent interpretability of LLM-driven temporal user profiling, outlining new research directions for developing adaptive and transparent recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2025), Workshop on User Modeling and Recommendation (UMRec).

| **[Pairwise and Attribute-Aware Decision Tree-Based Preference Elicitation for Cold-Start Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27342v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RSs) are intelligent filtering methods that suggest items to users based on their inferred preferences, derived from their interaction history on the platform. Collaborative filtering-based RSs rely on users past interactions to generate recommendations. However, when a user is new to the platform, referred to as a cold-start user, there is no historical data available, making it difficult to provide personalized recommendations. To address this, rating elicitation techniques can be used to gather initial ratings or preferences on selected items, helping to build an early understanding of the user's tastes. Rating elicitation approaches are generally categorized into two types: non-personalized and personalized. Decision tree-based rating elicitation is a personalized method that queries users about their preferences at each node of the tree until sufficient information is gathered. In this paper, we propose an extension to the decision tree approach for rating elicitation in the context of music recommendation. Our method: (i) elicits not only item ratings but also preferences on attributes such as genres to better cluster users, and (ii) uses item pairs instead of single items at each node to more effectively learn user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that both proposed enhancements lead to improved performance, particularly with a reduced number of queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inferring trust in recommendation systems from brain, behavioural, and physiological data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27272v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As people nowadays increasingly rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to curate information and make decisions, assigning the appropriate amount of trust in automated intelligent systems has become ever more important. However, current measurements of trust in automation still largely rely on self-reports that are subjective and disruptive to the user. Here, we take music recommendation as a model to investigate the neural and cognitive processes underlying trust in automation. We observed that system accuracy was directly related to users' trust and modulated the influence of recommendation cues on music preference. Modelling users' reward encoding process with a reinforcement learning model further revealed that system accuracy, expected reward, and prediction error were related to oscillatory neural activity recorded via EEG and changes in pupil diameter. Our results provide a neurally grounded account of calibrating trust in automation and highlight the promises of a multimodal approach towards developing trustable AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Generative Recommendation: Data, Model, and Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27157v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems serve as foundational infrastructure in modern information ecosystems, helping users navigate digital content and discover items aligned with their preferences. At their core, recommender systems address a fundamental problem: matching users with items. Over the past decades, the field has experienced successive paradigm shifts, from collaborative filtering and matrix factorization in the machine learning era to neural architectures in the deep learning era. Recently, the emergence of generative models, especially large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, have sparked a new paradigm: generative recommendation, which reconceptualizes recommendation as a generation task rather than discriminative scoring. This survey provides a comprehensive examination through a unified tripartite framework spanning data, model, and task dimensions. Rather than simply categorizing works, we systematically decompose approaches into operational stages-data augmentation and unification, model alignment and training, task formulation and execution. At the data level, generative models enable knowledge-infused augmentation and agent-based simulation while unifying heterogeneous signals. At the model level, we taxonomize LLM-based methods, large recommendation models, and diffusion approaches, analyzing their alignment mechanisms and innovations. At the task level, we illuminate new capabilities including conversational interaction, explainable reasoning, and personalized content generation. We identify five key advantages: world knowledge integration, natural language understanding, reasoning capabilities, scaling laws, and creative generation. We critically examine challenges in benchmark design, model robustness, and deployment efficiency, while charting a roadmap toward intelligent recommendation assistants that fundamentally reshape human-information interaction.</p></details> |  |

Such choices, however, often require balancing complex trade-offs between environmental impact, cost, convenience, and personal interests. To address this, we present the SmartSustain Recommender, a web application designed to nudge users toward eco-friendlier options through an interactive, user-centric interface. The system visualizes the broader consequences of travel decisions by combining CO2e emissions, destination popularity, and seasonality with personalized interest matching. It employs mechanisms such as interactive city cards for quick comparisons, dynamic banners that surface sustainable alternatives in specific trade-off scenarios, and real-time impact feedback using animated environmental indicators.

In our setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RecCocktail: A Generalizable and Efficient Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08271v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in recent years, owing to their impressive generalization capabilities and rich world knowledge. To capitalize on the potential of using LLMs as recommender systems, mainstream approaches typically focus on two paradigms. The first paradigm designs multi-domain or multi-task instruction data for generalizable recommendation, so as to align LLMs with general recommendation areas and deal with cold-start recommendation. The second paradigm focuses on enhancing domain-specific recommendation tasks, improving performance in warm recommendation scenarios. While most previous works treat these two paradigms separately, we argue that they have complementary advantages, and combining them can yield better results. In this paper, we propose a generalizable and efficient LLM-based recommendation framework RecCocktail. Our approach begins with fine-tuning a "base spirit" LoRA module using domain-general recommendation instruction data to align LLM with recommendation knowledge. Next, given users' behavior of a specific domain, we construct a domain-specific "ingredient" LoRA module. We then provide an entropy-guided adaptive merging method to mix the "base spirit" and the "ingredient" in the weight space. Please note that, RecCocktail combines the advantages of the existing two paradigms without introducing additional time or space overhead during the inference phase. Moreover, RecCocktail is efficient with plug and play, as the "base spirit" LoRA is trained only once, and any domain-specific "ingredient" can be efficiently mixed with only domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under both warm and cold-start recommendation scenarios validate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed RecCocktail.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vectorized Context-Aware Embeddings for GAT-Based Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26461v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems often struggle with data sparsity and cold-start scenarios, limiting their ability to provide accurate suggestions for new or infrequent users. This paper presents a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based Collaborative Filtering (CF) framework enhanced with Large Language Model (LLM) driven context aware embeddings. Specifically, we generate concise textual user profiles and unify item metadata (titles, genres, overviews) into rich textual embeddings, injecting these as initial node features in a bipartite user item graph. To further optimize ranking performance, we introduce a hybrid loss function that combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) with a cosine similarity term and robust negative sampling, ensuring explicit negative feedback is distinguished from unobserved data. Experiments on the MovieLens 100k and 1M datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in Precision, NDCG, and MAP while demonstrating robustness for users with limited interaction history. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of LLM-augmented embeddings and the cosine similarity term in capturing nuanced semantic relationships. Our approach effectively mitigates sparsity and cold-start limitations by integrating LLM-derived contextual understanding into graph-based architectures. Future directions include balancing recommendation accuracy with coverage and diversity, and introducing fairness-aware constraints and interpretability features to enhance system performance further.</p></details> |  |

Existing shilling methods can generate effective and stealthy fake profiles when training data only contain rating matrix, but they lack comprehensive solutions for scenarios where side features are present and utilized by the recommender. To address this gap, we extend the Leg-UP framework by enhancing the generator architecture to incorporate side features, enabling the generation of side-feature-aware fake user profiles. Experiments on benchmarks show that our method achieves strong attack performance while maintaining stealthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneTrans: Unified Feature Interaction and Sequence Modeling with One Transformer in Industrial Recommender](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26104v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recommendation systems, scaling up feature-interaction modules (e.g., Wukong, RankMixer) or user-behavior sequence modules (e.g., LONGER) has achieved notable success. However, these efforts typically proceed on separate tracks, which not only hinders bidirectional information exchange but also prevents unified optimization and scaling. In this paper, we propose OneTrans, a unified Transformer backbone that simultaneously performs user-behavior sequence modeling and feature interaction. OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer to convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token sequence. The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar sequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential tokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables precomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly reducing computational costs during both training and inference. Experimental results on industrial-scale datasets demonstrate that OneTrans scales efficiently with increasing parameters, consistently outperforms strong baselines, and yields a 5.68% lift in per-user GMV in online A/B tests.</p></details> |  |

However, the research and development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models. ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard. Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco, featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages. ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12 representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets, with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations. ORBIT benchmark, leaderboard, and codebase are available at https://www.open-reco-bench.ai.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Datasets & Benchmarks track</p></details> |

However, this method struggles with scalability and generalization in large, dynamic datasets that have sparse long-tail data. Content-based Semantic IDs (SIDs) address this by sharing knowledge through content quantization. However, by ignoring dynamic behavioral properties, purely content-based SIDs have limited expressive power. Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral information but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform content features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse, creating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and long-tail items. This oversight leads to two critical limitations: (1) Noise Corruption: Indiscriminate behavior-content alignment allows collaborative noise from long-tail items to corrupt their content representations, leading to the loss of critical multimodal information. (2)Signal Obscurity: The equal-weighting scheme for SIDs fails to reflect the varying importance of different behavioral signals, making it difficult for downstream tasks to distinguish important SIDs from uninformative ones. To tackle these issues, we propose a mixture-of-quantization framework, MMQ-v2, to adaptively Align, Denoise, and Amplify multimodal information from content and behavior modalities for semantic IDs learning. The semantic IDs generated by this framework named ADA-SID. It introduces two innovations: an adaptive behavior-content alignment that is aware of information richness to shield representations from noise, and a dynamic behavioral router to amplify critical signals by applying different weights to SIDs. Extensive experiments on public and large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate ADA-SID's significant superiority in both generative and discriminative recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoupled Multimodal Fusion for User Interest Modeling in Click-Through Rate Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11066v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern industrial recommendation systems improve recommendation performance by integrating multimodal representations from pre-trained models into ID-based Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction frameworks. However, existing approaches typically adopt modality-centric modeling strategies that process ID-based and multimodal embeddings independently, failing to capture fine-grained interactions between content semantics and behavioral signals. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Multimodal Fusion (DMF), which introduces a modality-enriched modeling strategy to enable fine-grained interactions between ID-based collaborative representations and multimodal representations for user interest modeling. Specifically, we construct target-aware features to bridge the semantic gap across different embedding spaces and leverage them as side information to enhance the effectiveness of user interest modeling. Furthermore, we design an inference-optimized attention mechanism that decouples the computation of target-aware features and ID-based embeddings before the attention layer, thereby alleviating the computational bottleneck introduced by incorporating target-aware features. To achieve comprehensive multimodal integration, DMF combines user interest representations learned under the modality-centric and modality-enriched modeling strategies. Offline experiments on public and industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DMF. Moreover, DMF has been deployed on the product recommendation system of the international e-commerce platform Lazada, achieving relative improvements of 5.30% in CTCVR and 7.43% in GMV with negligible computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Task-Centric Perspective on Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21188v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many studies in recommender systems (RecSys) adopt a general problem definition, i.e., to recommend preferred items to users based on past interactions. Such abstraction often lacks the domain-specific nuances necessary for practical deployment. However, models are frequently evaluated using datasets collected from online recommender platforms, which inherently reflect domain or task specificities. In this paper, we analyze RecSys task formulations, emphasizing key components such as input-output structures, temporal dynamics, and candidate item selection. All these factors directly impact offline evaluation. We further examine the complexities of user-item interactions, including decision-making costs, multi-step engagements, and unobservable interactions, which may influence model design. Additionally, we explore the balance between task specificity and model generalizability, highlighting how well-defined task formulations serve as the foundation for robust evaluation and effective solution development. By clarifying task definitions and their implications, this work provides a structured perspective on RecSys research. The goal is to help researchers better navigate the field, particularly in understanding specificities of the RecSys tasks and ensuring fair and meaningful evaluations.</p></details> |  |

However, current LLM-based approaches face critical limitations in modeling users' long-term and diverse interests. First, due to inference latency and feature fetching bandwidth constraints, existing methods typically truncate user behavior sequences to include only the most recent interactions, resulting in the loss of valuable long-range preference signals. Second, most current methods rely on next-item prediction with a single predicted embedding, overlooking the multifaceted nature of user interests and limiting recommendation diversity. To address these challenges, we propose HyMiRec, a hybrid multi-interest sequential recommendation framework, which leverages a lightweight recommender to extracts coarse interest embeddings from long user sequences and an LLM-based recommender to captures refined interest embeddings. To alleviate the overhead of fetching features, we introduce a residual codebook based on cosine similarity, enabling efficient compression and reuse of user history embeddings. To model the diverse preferences of users, we design a disentangled multi-interest learning module, which leverages multiple interest queries to learn disentangles multiple interest signals adaptively, allowing the model to capture different facets of user intent. Extensive experiments are conducted on both benchmark datasets and a collected industrial dataset, demonstrating our effectiveness over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, online A/B testing shows that HyMiRec brings consistent improvements in real-world recommendation systems.

| **[Who You Are Matters: Bridging Topics and Social Roles via LLM-Enhanced Logical Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10940v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems filter contents/items valuable to users by inferring preferences from user features and historical behaviors. Mainstream approaches follow the learning-to-rank paradigm, which focus on discovering and modeling item topics (e.g., categories), and capturing user preferences on these topics based on historical interactions. However, this paradigm often neglects the modeling of user characteristics and their social roles, which are logical confounders influencing the correlated interest and user preference transition. To bridge this gap, we introduce the user role identification task and the behavioral logic modeling task that aim to explicitly model user roles and learn the logical relations between item topics and user social roles. We show that it is possible to explicitly solve these tasks through an efficient integration framework of Large Language Model (LLM) and recommendation systems, for which we propose TagCF. On the one hand, TagCF exploits the (Multi-modal) LLM's world knowledge and logic inference ability to extract realistic tag-based virtual logic graphs that reveal dynamic and expressive knowledge of users, refining our understanding of user behaviors. On the other hand, TagCF presents empirically effective integration modules that take advantage of the extracted tag-logic information, augmenting the recommendation performance. We conduct both online experiments and offline experiments with industrial and public datasets as verification of TagCF's effectiveness, and we empirically show that the user role modeling strategy is potentially a better choice than the modeling of item topics. Additionally, we provide evidence that the extracted logic graphs are empirically a general and transferable knowledge that can benefit a wide range of recommendation tasks. Our code is available in https://github.com/Code2Q/TagCF.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While significant progress has been made in developing advanced and scalable architectures for sequential recommendation(SR) models, there are still challenges due to items' multi-faceted characteristics and dynamic item relevance in the user context. To address these issues, we propose Fuxi-MME, a framework that integrates a multi-embedding strategy with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Specifically, to efficiently capture diverse item characteristics in a decoupled manner, we decompose the conventional single embedding matrix into several lower-dimensional embedding matrices. Additionally, by substituting relevant parameters in the Fuxi Block with an MoE layer, our model achieves adaptive and specialized transformation of the enriched representations. Empirical results on public datasets show that our proposed framework outperforms several competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |

A Comparative Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05493v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, integrating large language models (LLMs) into recommender systems has created new opportunities for improving recommendation quality. However, a comprehensive benchmark is needed to thoroughly evaluate and compare the recommendation capabilities of LLMs with traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we introduce RecBench, which systematically investigates various item representation forms (including unique identifier, text, semantic embedding, and semantic identifier) and evaluates two primary recommendation tasks, i.e., click-through rate prediction (CTR) and sequential recommendation (SeqRec). Our extensive experiments cover up to 17 large models and are conducted across five diverse datasets from fashion, news, video, books, and music domains. Our findings indicate that LLM-based recommenders outperform conventional recommenders, achieving up to a 5% AUC improvement in the CTR scenario and up to a 170% NDCG@10 improvement in the SeqRec scenario. However, these substantial performance gains come at the expense of significantly reduced inference efficiency, rendering the LLM-as-RS paradigm impractical for real-time recommendation environments. We aim for our findings to inspire future research, including recommendation-specific model acceleration methods. We will release our code, data, configurations, and platform to enable other researchers to reproduce and build upon our experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 DB Track Accepted Paper</p></details> |

A key challenge lies in exploring optimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent research follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator produces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In practice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model. However, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the separation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second, autoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we propose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address the two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an autoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic autoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we pre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter initialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating sequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we propose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient autoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP), which trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items while preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time recommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF outperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is nearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also been deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily active users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

Existing LoRA-based continual methods primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors. Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware, direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Contrastive methods struggle with inefficient and biased negative sampling, while non-contrastive approaches rely solely on positive samples. Existing models perform well in transductive settings, but their effectiveness in inductive, weighted, and bipartite scenarios remains untested. To address this, we propose Weighted Bipartite Triplet-Bootstrapped Graph Latents (WBT-BGRL), a non-contrastive framework that enhances bootstrapped learning with a novel weighting mechanism in the triplet loss. Using a bipartite architecture with dual GCN encoders, WBT-BGRL is evaluated against adapted state-of-the-art models (T-BGRL, BGRL, GBT, CCA-SSG).

Conventional recommender systems rely on centralized data, a paradigm often incompatible with modern data protection regulations. A novel privacy-preserving recommender system is proposed and evaluated to address this critical issue using Federated Learning (FL). The approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with rich, engineered features from the large-scale ASSISTments educational dataset. A rigorous comparative analysis of federated aggregation strategies was conducted, identifying FedProx as a significantly more stable and effective method for handling heterogeneous student data than the standard FedAvg baseline. The optimized federated model achieves a high-performance F1-Score of 76.28%, corresponding to 92% of the performance of a powerful, centralized XGBoost model. These findings validate that a federated approach can provide highly effective content recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data. Consequently, our work presents a viable and robust solution to the personalization-privacy dilemma in modern educational platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been prepared to be submitted to the Informatics in Education</p></details> |

We introduce Reference Prediction from Talks (RPT), a new task that maps long, and unstructured scientific presentations to relevant papers. To support research on RPT, we present Talk2Ref, the first large-scale dataset of its kind, containing 6,279 talks and 43,429 cited papers (26 per talk on average), where relevance is approximated by the papers cited in the talk's corresponding source publication. We establish strong baselines by evaluating state-of-the-art text embedding models in zero-shot retrieval scenarios, and propose a dual-encoder architecture trained on Talk2Ref. We further explore strategies for handling long transcripts, as well as training for domain adaptation. Our results show that fine-tuning on Talk2Ref significantly improves citation prediction performance, demonstrating both the challenges of the task and the effectiveness of our dataset for learning semantic representations from spoken scientific content.

Conventional recommenders, dominated by massive embedding tables, tend to plateau as embedding dimensions grow. In contrast, the emerging generative paradigm replaces embeddings with compact Semantic ID (SID) sequences produced by autoregressive Transformers. Yet most industrial deployments remain proprietary, leaving two fundamental questions open: (1) Do the expected scaling laws hold on public benchmarks? (2) What is the minimal post-training recipe that enables competitive performance? We present MiniOneRec, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully open-source generative recommendation framework, which provides an end-to-end workflow spanning SID construction, supervised fine-tuning, and recommendation-oriented reinforcement learning. We generate SIDs via a Residual Quantized VAE and post-train Qwen backbones ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters on the Amazon Review dataset. Our experiments reveal a consistent downward trend in both training and evaluation losses with increasing model size, validating the parameter efficiency of the generative approach. To further enhance performance, we propose a lightweight yet effective post-training pipeline that (1) enforces full-process SID alignment and (2) applies reinforcement learning with constrained decoding and hybrid rewards. Together, these techniques yield significant improvements in both ranking accuracy and candidate diversity.</p></details> | Technical Report |

We then introduce a geo-temporal embedding informativeness test as a lightweight diagnostic, demonstrating on MovieLens, LastFM, and a production dataset that these embeddings provide predictive signal consistent with the outcomes of full model integrations. Geo-temporal embeddings are incorporated into sequential models through (1) direct feature fusion with metadata embeddings or (2) an auxiliary loss that enforces semantic and geo-temporal alignment. Our findings highlight the need for adaptive or hybrid recommendation strategies, and we release a context-enriched MovieLens dataset to support future research.</p></details> |  |

Traditional recommendation systems typically prioritize business metric optimization within isolated specific scenarios, neglecting cross-scenario behavioral signals and struggling to integrate advanced techniques like LLMs at billion-scale deployments, which finally limits their ability to capture holistic user interests across platform touchpoints. We propose RED-Rec, an LLM-enhanced hierarchical Recommender Engine for Diversified scenarios, tailored for industry-level content recommendation systems. RED-Rec unifies user interest representations across multiple behavioral contexts by aggregating and synthesizing actions from varied scenarios, resulting in comprehensive item and user modeling. At its core, a two-tower LLM-powered framework enables nuanced, multifaceted representations with deployment efficiency, and a scenario-aware dense mixing and querying policy effectively fuses diverse behavioral signals to capture cross-scenario user intent patterns and express fine-grained, context-specific intents during serving. We validate RED-Rec through online A/B testing on hundreds of millions of users in RedNote through online A/B testing, showing substantial performance gains in both content recommendation and advertisement targeting tasks. We further introduce a million-scale sequential recommendation dataset, RED-MMU, for comprehensive offline training and evaluation.

Owing to the massive candidate pool and strict latency constraints, industry systems often rely on lightweight two-tower architectures, which are computationally efficient yet limited in estimation capability. As a result, they struggle to capture the complex synergistic and suppressive relationships among candidate items, which are essential for producing contextually coherent and diverse recommendation lists. Moreover, this simplicity further amplifies the Sample Selection Bias (SSB) problem, as coarse-grained models trained on biased exposure data must generalize to a much larger candidate space with distinct distributions. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DUET} (\textbf{DU}al Model Co-Training for \textbf{E}ntire Space C\textbf{T}R Prediction), a set-wise pre-ranking framework that achieves expressive modeling under tight computational budgets. Instead of scoring items independently, DUET performs set-level prediction over the entire candidate subset in a single forward pass, enabling information-aware interactions among candidates while amortizing the computational cost across the set. Moreover, a dual model co-training mechanism extends supervision to unexposed items via mutual pseudo-label refinement, effectively mitigating SSB. Validated through extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing, DUET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves improvements across multiple core business metrics. At present, DUET has been fully deployed in Kuaishou and Kuaishou Lite Apps, serving the main traffic for hundreds of millions of users.</p></details> |  |

OneRec reformulates recommendation as an autoregressive generation task, achieving high Model FLOPs Utilization. While OneRec-V1 has shown significant empirical success in real-world deployment, two critical challenges hinder its scalability and performance: (1) inefficient computational allocation where 97.66% of resources are consumed by sequence encoding rather than generation, and (2) limitations in reinforcement learning relying solely on reward models. To address these challenges, we propose OneRec-V2, featuring: (1) Lazy Decoder-Only Architecture: Eliminates encoder bottlenecks, reducing total computation by 94% and training resources by 90%, enabling successful scaling to 8B parameters. (2) Preference Alignment with Real-World User Interactions: Incorporates Duration-Aware Reward Shaping and Adaptive Ratio Clipping to better align with user preferences using real-world feedback. Extensive A/B tests on Kuaishou demonstrate OneRec-V2's effectiveness, improving App Stay Time by 0.467%/0.741% while balancing multi-objective recommendations. This work advances generative recommendation scalability and alignment with real-world feedback, representing a step forward in the development of end-to-end recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIME: Link-based user-item Interaction Modeling with decoupled xor attention for Efficient test time scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18239v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling large recommendation systems requires advancing three major frontiers: processing longer user histories, expanding candidate sets, and increasing model capacity. While promising, transformers' computational cost scales quadratically with the user sequence length and linearly with the number of candidates. This trade-off makes it prohibitively expensive to expand candidate sets or increase sequence length at inference, despite the significant performance improvements. We introduce \textbf{LIME}, a novel architecture that resolves this trade-off. Through two key innovations, LIME fundamentally reduces computational complexity. First, low-rank ``link embeddings" enable pre-computation of attention weights by decoupling user and candidate interactions, making the inference cost nearly independent of candidate set size. Second, a linear attention mechanism, \textbf{LIME-XOR}, reduces the complexity with respect to user sequence length from quadratic ($O(N^2)$) to linear ($O(N)$). Experiments on public and industrial datasets show LIME achieves near-parity with state-of-the-art transformers but with a 10$\times$ inference speedup on large candidate sets or long sequence lengths. When tested on a major recommendation platform, LIME improved user engagement while maintaining minimal inference costs with respect to candidate set size and user history length, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and expressive recommendation systems.</p></details> | 16 pages |

With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), recent research has explored leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enhance rating prediction tasks. However, existing distillation-based methods suffer from limitations such as the teacher model's insufficient recommendation capability, costly and static supervision, and superficial transfer of reasoning ability. To address these issues, this paper proposes RecZero, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based recommendation paradigm that abandons the traditional multi-model and multi-stage distillation approach. Instead, RecZero trains a single LLM through pure RL to autonomously develop reasoning capabilities for rating prediction. RecZero consists of two key components: (1) "Think-before-Recommendation" prompt construction, which employs a structured reasoning template to guide the model in step-wise analysis of user interests, item features, and user-item compatibility; and (2) rule-based reward modeling, which adopts group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to compute rewards for reasoning trajectories and optimize the LLM. Additionally, the paper explores a hybrid paradigm, RecOne, which combines supervised fine-tuning with RL, initializing the model with cold-start reasoning samples and further optimizing it with RL. Experimental results demonstrate that RecZero and RecOne significantly outperform existing baseline methods on multiple benchmark datasets, validating the superiority of the RL paradigm in achieving autonomous reasoning-enhanced recommender systems.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 poster |
| **[Membership Inference Attacks on Recommender System: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11080v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RecSys) have been widely applied to various applications, including E-commerce, finance, healthcare, social media and have become increasingly influential in shaping user behavior and decision-making, highlighting their growing impact in various domains. However, recent studies have shown that RecSys are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether user interaction record was used to train a target model or not. MIAs on RecSys models can directly lead to a privacy breach. For example, via identifying the fact that a purchase record that has been used to train a RecSys associated with a specific user, an attacker can infer that user's special quirks. In recent years, MIAs have been shown to be effective on other ML tasks, e.g., classification models and natural language processing. However, traditional MIAs are ill-suited for RecSys due to the unseen posterior probability. Although MIAs on RecSys form a newly emerging and rapidly growing research area, there has been no systematic survey on this topic yet. In this article, we conduct the first comprehensive survey on RecSys MIAs. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in RecSys MIAs, exploring the design principles, challenges, attack and defense associated with this emerging field. We provide a unified taxonomy that categorizes different RecSys MIAs based on their characterizations and discuss their pros and cons. Based on the limitations and gaps identified in this survey, we point out several promising future research directions to inspire the researchers who wish to follow this area. This survey not only serves as a reference for the research community but also provides a clear description for researchers outside this research domain.</p></details> | under review |

Although scaling laws indicate that larger models generally yield better generalization and performance, their substantial computational requirements often render them impractical for many real-world scenarios at scale. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of insights for training and deploying small language models (SLMs) that deliver high performance for a variety of industry use cases. We focus on two key techniques: (1) knowledge distillation and (2) model compression via structured pruning and quantization. These approaches enable SLMs to retain much of the quality of their larger counterparts while significantly reducing training/serving costs and latency. We detail the impact of these techniques on a variety of use cases in a large professional social network platform and share deployment lessons, including hardware optimization strategies that improve speed and throughput for both predictive and reasoning-based applications in Recommendation Systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Industry Track - Oral Presentation</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel algorithm that integrates hop-based and random-walk-based methods to identify high-quality communities, effectively addressing this balance. Our approach employs the concept of the domination score to quantify the influence of nodes based on their attributes, followed by $k$-core extraction to ensure strong structural cohesion within the communities. By considering both the network structure and node attributes, the algorithm identifies communities that are not only well-connected, but also share meaningful attribute similarities. We evaluated the algorithm on large real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to efficiently identify cohesive communities, making it suitable for applications such as social network analysis and recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple but Effective Elaborative Query Reformulation Approach for Natural Language Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02656v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural Language (NL) recommender systems aim to retrieve relevant items from free-form user queries and item descriptions. Existing systems often rely on dense retrieval (DR), which struggles to interpret challenging queries that express broad (e.g., "cities for youth friendly activities") or indirect (e.g., "cities for a high school graduation trip") user intents. While query reformulation (QR) has been widely adopted to improve such systems, existing QR methods tend to focus only on expanding the range of query subtopics (breadth) or elaborating on the potential meaning of a query (depth), but not both. In this paper, we propose EQR (Elaborative Subtopic Query Reformulation), a large language model-based QR method that combines both breadth and depth by generating potential query subtopics with information-rich elaborations. We also introduce three new natural language recommendation benchmarks in travel, hotel, and restaurant domains to establish evaluation of NL recommendation with challenging queries. Experiments show EQR substantially outperforms state-of-the-art QR methods in various evaluation metrics, highlighting that a simple yet effective QR approach can significantly improve NL recommender systems for queries with broad and indirect user intents.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Inductive Transfer Learning for Graph-Based Recommenders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22799v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based recommender systems are commonly trained in transductive settings, which limits their applicability to new users, items, or datasets. We propose NBF-Rec, a graph-based recommendation model that supports inductive transfer learning across datasets with disjoint user and item sets. Unlike conventional embedding-based methods that require retraining for each domain, NBF-Rec computes node embeddings dynamically at inference time. We evaluate the method on seven real-world datasets spanning movies, music, e-commerce, and location check-ins. NBF-Rec achieves competitive performance in zero-shot settings, where no target domain data is used for training, and demonstrates further improvements through lightweight fine-tuning. These results show that inductive transfer is feasible in graph-based recommendation and that interaction-level message passing supports generalization across datasets without requiring aligned users or items.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the New Perspectives in Graph Machine Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[From Contextual Combinatorial Semi-Bandits to Bandit List Classification: Improved Sample Complexity with Sparse Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09257v3)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of contextual combinatorial semi-bandits, where input contexts are mapped into subsets of size $m$ of a collection of $K$ possible actions. In each round, the learner observes the realized reward of the predicted actions. Motivated by prototypical applications of contextual bandits, we focus on the $s$-sparse regime where we assume that the sum of rewards is bounded by some value $s\ll K$. For example, in recommendation systems the number of products purchased by any customer is significantly smaller than the total number of available products. Our main result is for the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC variant of the problem for which we design an algorithm that returns an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability using a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}((poly(K/m)+sm/\epsilon^2) \log(|\Pi|/\delta))$ where $\Pi$ is the underlying (finite) class and $s$ is the sparsity parameter. This bound improves upon known bounds for combinatorial semi-bandits whenever $s\ll K$, and in the regime where $s=O(1)$, the leading terms in our bound match the corresponding full-information rates, implying that bandit feedback essentially comes at no cost. Our algorithm is also computationally efficient given access to an ERM oracle for $\Pi$. Our framework generalizes the list multiclass classification problem with bandit feedback, which can be seen as a special case with binary reward vectors. In the special case of single-label classification corresponding to $s=m=1$, we prove an $O((K^7+1/\epsilon^2)\log(|H|/\delta))$ sample complexity bound, which improves upon recent results in this scenario. Additionally, we consider the regret minimization setting where data can be generated adversarially, and establish a regret bound of $\tilde O(|\Pi|+\sqrt{smT\log |\Pi|})$, extending the result of Erez et al. (2024) who consider the simpler single label classification setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Search and Recommendation with Dual-View Representation Learning in a Generative Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06714v3)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems and search engines serve as foundational elements of online platforms, with the former delivering information proactively and the latter enabling users to seek information actively. Unifying both tasks in a shared model is promising since it can enhance user modeling and item understanding. Previous approaches mainly follow a discriminative paradigm, utilizing shared encoders to process input features and task-specific heads to perform each task. However, this paradigm encounters two key challenges: gradient conflict and manual design complexity. From the information theory perspective, these challenges potentially both stem from the same issue -- low mutual information between the input features and task-specific outputs during the optimization process. To tackle these issues, we propose GenSR, a novel generative paradigm for unifying search and recommendation (S&R), which leverages task-specific prompts to partition the model's parameter space into subspaces, thereby enhancing mutual information. To construct effective subspaces for each task, GenSR first prepares informative representations for each subspace and then optimizes both subspaces in one unified model. Specifically, GenSR consists of two main modules: (1) Dual Representation Learning, which independently models collaborative and semantic historical information to derive expressive item representations; and (2) S&R Task Unifying, which utilizes contrastive learning together with instruction tuning to generate task-specific outputs effectively. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show GenSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods across S&R tasks. Our work introduces a new generative paradigm compared with previous discriminative methods and establishes its superiority from the mutual information perspective.</p></details> |  |

Existing automatic CRS evaluation methods are proven insufficient for evaluating the dynamic nature of recommendation conversations. This work proposes FACE: a Fine-grained, Aspect-based Conversation Evaluation method that provides evaluation scores for diverse turn and dialogue level qualities of recommendation conversations. FACE is reference-free and shows strong correlation with human judgments, achieving system correlation of 0.9 and turn/dialogue-level of 0.5, outperforming state-of-the-art CRS evaluation methods by a large margin. Additionally, unlike existing LLM-based methods that provide single uninterpretable scores, FACE provides insights into the system performance and enables identifying and locating problems within conversations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Massive Memorization with Hundreds of Trillions of Parameters for Sequential Transducer Generative Recommenders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22049v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern large-scale recommendation systems rely heavily on user interaction history sequences to enhance the model performance. The advent of large language models and sequential modeling techniques, particularly transformer-like architectures, has led to significant advancements recently (e.g., HSTU, SIM, and TWIN models). While scaling to ultra-long user histories (10k to 100k items) generally improves model performance, it also creates significant challenges on latency, queries per second (QPS) and GPU cost in industry-scale recommendation systems. Existing models do not adequately address these industrial scalability issues. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage modeling framework, namely VIrtual Sequential Target Attention (VISTA), which decomposes traditional target attention from a candidate item to user history items into two distinct stages: (1) user history summarization into a few hundred tokens; followed by (2) candidate item attention to those tokens. These summarization token embeddings are then cached in storage system and then utilized as sequence features for downstream model training and inference. This novel design for scalability enables VISTA to scale to lifelong user histories (up to one million items) while keeping downstream training and inference costs fixed, which is essential in industry. Our approach achieves significant improvements in offline and online metrics and has been successfully deployed on an industry leading recommendation platform serving billions of users.</p></details> |  |

| **[Faster and Memory-Efficient Training of Sequential Recommendation Models for Large Catalogs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09682v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendations (SR) with transformer-based architectures are widely adopted in real-world applications, where SR models require frequent retraining to adapt to ever-changing user preferences. However, training transformer-based SR models often encounters a high computational cost associated with scoring extensive item catalogs, often exceeding thousands of items. This occurs mainly due to the use of cross-entropy loss, where peak memory scales proportionally to catalog size, batch size, and sequence length. Recognizing this, practitioners in the field of recommendation systems typically address memory consumption by integrating the cross-entropy (CE) loss with negative sampling, thereby reducing the explicit memory demands of the final layer. However, a small number of negative samples would degrade model performance, and as we demonstrate in our work, increasing the number of negative samples and the batch size further improves the model's performance, but rapidly starts to exceed industrial GPUs' size (~40Gb). In this work, we introduce the CCE- method, which offers a GPU-efficient implementation of the CE loss with negative sampling. Our method accelerates training by up to two times while reducing memory consumption by more than 10 times. Leveraging the memory savings afforded by using CCE- for model training, it becomes feasible to enhance its accuracy on datasets with a large item catalog compared to those trained with original PyTorch-implemented loss functions. Finally, we perform an analysis of key memory-related hyperparameters and highlight the necessity of a delicate balance among these factors. We demonstrate that scaling both the number of negative samples and batch size leads to better results rather than maximizing only one of them. To facilitate further adoption of CCE-, we release a Triton kernel that efficiently implements the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Explainable Personalized Recommendations by Learning from Users' Photos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21455v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS), is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item. In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six cities of different sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Latent Reasoning for LLM-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19092v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks, sparking growing interest in their application to preference reasoning in recommendation systems. Existing methods typically rely on fine-tuning with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) data. However, these methods face significant practical limitations due to (1) the difficulty of obtaining high-quality CoT data in recommendation and (2) the high inference latency caused by generating CoT reasoning. In this work, we explore an alternative approach that shifts from explicit CoT reasoning to compact, information-dense latent reasoning. This approach eliminates the need for explicit CoT generation and improves inference efficiency, as few latent tokens can effectively capture the entire reasoning process. Building on this idea, we propose \textit{\underline{R}einforced \underline{Latent} \underline{R}easoning for \underline{R}ecommendation} (LatentR$^3$), a novel end-to-end training framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize latent reasoning without relying on any CoT data. LatentR$^3$ adopts a two-stage training strategy: first, supervised fine-tuning to initialize the latent reasoning module, followed by pure RL training to encourage exploration through a rule-based reward design. Our RL implementation is based on a modified GRPO algorithm, which reduces computational overhead during training and introduces continuous reward signals for more efficient learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LatentR$^3$ enables effective latent reasoning without any direct supervision of the reasoning process, significantly improving performance when integrated with different LLM-based recommendation methods. Our codes are available at https://github.com/xuwenxinedu/R3.</p></details> |  |

However, there is scarcity of large-scale, publicly available test collections for evaluating NL profile-based recommendation. To address this gap, we introduce SciNUP, a novel synthetic dataset for scholarly recommendation that leverages authors' publication histories to generate NL profiles and corresponding ground truth items. We use this dataset to conduct a comparison of baseline methods, ranging from sparse and dense retrieval approaches to state-of-the-art LLM-based rerankers. Our results show that while baseline methods achieve comparable performance, they often retrieve different items, indicating complementary behaviors. At the same time, considerable headroom for improvement remains, highlighting the need for effective NL-based recommendation approaches. The SciNUP dataset thus serves as a valuable resource for fostering future research and development in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausalRec: A CausalBoost Attention Model for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21333v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in correlation-based sequential recommendation systems have demonstrated substantial success. Specifically, the attention-based model outperforms other RNN-based and Markov chains-based models by capturing both short- and long-term dependencies more effectively. However, solely focusing on item co-occurrences overlooks the underlying motivations behind user behaviors, leading to spurious correlations and potentially inaccurate recommendations. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework that integrates causal attention for sequential recommendation, CausalRec. It incorporates a causal discovery block and a CausalBooster. The causal discovery block learns the causal graph in user behavior sequences, and we provide a theory to guarantee the identifiability of the learned causal graph. The CausalBooster utilizes the discovered causal graph to refine the attention mechanism, prioritizing behaviors with causal significance. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets indicate that CausalRec outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, with average improvements of 7.21% in Hit Rate (HR) and 8.65% in Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model to incorporate causality through the attention mechanism in sequential recommendation, demonstrating the value of causality in generating more accurate and reliable recommendations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Surveys and overviews; Natural language processing; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Graph algorithms</p></details> |

Yet, aligning LLMs to the recommendation task remains challenging: pretrained LLMs often generate out-of-catalog items, violate required output formats, and their ranking quality degrades sharply toward the end of the generated list. To this end, we propose ConvRec-R1, a two-stage framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based conversational recommender systems. In Stage 1, we construct a behavioral-cloning dataset with a Remap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline, which produces high-quality, catalog-grounded demonstrations from powerful blackbox LLMs to warm-start the RL training. In Stage 2, we propose Rank-GRPO, a principled extension of group relative policy optimization (GRPO) tailored to tasks with rank-style outputs. Rank-GRPO treats each rank in the recommendation list as the unit instead of token (too fine-grained) or sequence (too coarse), redefining rewards to remove non-causal credit assignment and introducing a rank-level importance ratio based on the geometric mean of rank-wise token probabilities to stabilize policy updates. Experiments on the public Reddit-v2 dataset show that ConvRec-R1 converges faster and achieves higher Recall and NDCG than GRPO-style baselines. Code and datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/Rank-GRPO.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets, particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes 5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems. The dataset is publicly available to the research community under the data usage agreements at https://github.com/DUTIR-BioNLP/CDrugRed.</p></details> |  |

This extends prior work (which assumes institutions evaluate candidates in an identical manner) to a more realistic setting in which institutions rely on overlapping, but independently processed, criteria. These evaluations could consist of a variety of informative tools such as standardized tests, shared recommendation systems, or AI-based assessments with local noise. Two key parameters govern evaluations: the bias parameter $\beta \in (0,1]$, which models systematic disadvantage faced by one group, and the correlation parameter $\gamma \in [0,1]$, which captures the alignment between institutional rankings. We study the representation ratio, i.e., the ratio of disadvantaged to advantaged candidates selected by the matching process in this setting. Focusing on a regime in which all candidates prefer the same institution, we characterize the large-market equilibrium and derive a closed-form expression for the resulting representation ratio. Prior work shows that when $\gamma = 1$, this ratio scales linearly with $\beta$. In contrast, we show that the representation ratio increases nonlinearly with $\gamma$ and even modest losses in correlation can cause sharp drops in the representation ratio. Our analysis identifies critical $\gamma$-thresholds where institutional selection behavior undergoes discrete transitions, and reveals structural conditions under which evaluator alignment or bias mitigation are most effective. Finally, we show how this framework and results enable interventions for fairness-aware design in decentralized selection systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Probably Approximately Precision and Recall Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13029v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precision and Recall are fundamental metrics in machine learning tasks where both accurate predictions and comprehensive coverage are essential, such as in multi-label learning, language generation, medical studies, and recommender systems. A key challenge in these settings is the prevalence of one-sided feedback, where only positive examples are observed during training--e.g., in multi-label tasks like tagging people in Facebook photos, we may observe only a few tagged individuals, without knowing who else appears in the image. To address learning under such partial feedback, we introduce a Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework in which hypotheses are set functions that map each input to a set of labels, extending beyond single-label predictions and generalizing classical binary, multi-class, and multi-label models. Our results reveal sharp statistical and algorithmic separations from standard settings: classical methods such as Empirical Risk Minimization provably fail, even for simple hypothesis classes. We develop new algorithms that learn from positive data alone, achieving optimal sample complexity in the realizable case, and establishing multiplicative--rather than additive-approximation guarantees in the agnostic case, where achieving additive regret is impossible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Panorama: Fast-Track Nearest Neighbors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00566v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space, aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99% of query time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms compact over 90% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns. Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Ranker: A Lightweight Ranking framework for LLM Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21883v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional research on large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on refining output distributions, while paying less attention to the decoding process that transforms these distributions into final responses. Recent advances, such as scaling the computation of inference time with reward models, have underscored the importance of decoding, but these methods often suffer from high computational costs and limited applicability. In this paper, we revisit LLM generation through the lens of recommender systems, conceptualizing the decoding process as analogous to the ranking stage in recommendation pipelines. From this perspective, we observe that both traditional decoding methods and reward models exhibit clear limitations such as redundancy. Motivated by this insight, we propose Language Ranker, a novel framework that introduces a lightweight module to rerank candidate responses using features extracted by the base model. Experiments across a wide range of tasks show that Language Ranker achieves performance comparable to large-scale reward models, while requiring only <0.5M additional parameters, significantly reducing the computational overhead during both training and inference stages. This highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, showcasing its potential to fully unlock the capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Embedding Transformation for Mood-Guided Music Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20759v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Music representations are the backbone of modern recommendation systems, powering playlist generation, similarity search, and personalized discovery. Yet most embeddings offer little control for adjusting a single musical attribute, e.g., changing only the mood of a track while preserving its genre or instrumentation. In this work, we address the problem of controllable music retrieval through embedding-based transformation, where the objective is to retrieve songs that remain similar to a seed track but are modified along one chosen dimension. We propose a novel framework for mood-guided music embedding transformation, which learns a mapping from a seed audio embedding to a target embedding guided by mood labels, while preserving other musical attributes. Because mood cannot be directly altered in the seed audio, we introduce a sampling mechanism that retrieves proxy targets to balance diversity with similarity to the seed. We train a lightweight translation model using this sampling strategy and introduce a novel joint objective that encourages transformation and information preservation. Extensive experiments on two datasets show strong mood transformation performance while retaining genre and instrumentation far better than training-free baselines, establishing controllable embedding transformation as a promising paradigm for personalized music retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; under review</p></details> |

Their income is largely influenced by their number of views and followers, which in turn depends on the platform's recommender system (RS). So, as with regular jobs, it is important to ensure that RSs distribute revenue in a fair way. For example, prior work analyzed whether the creators of the highest-quality content would receive the most followers and income. Results showed this is unlikely to be the case, but did not suggest targeted solutions. In this work, we first use theoretical analysis and simulations on synthetic datasets to understand the system better and find interventions that improve fairness for creators. We find that the use of ordered pairwise comparison overcomes the cold start problem for a new set of items and greatly increases the chance of achieving fair outcomes for all content creators. Importantly, it also maintains user satisfaction. We also test the intervention on the MovieLens dataset and investigate its effectiveness on platforms with interaction histories that are currently unfair for content creators. These experiments reveal that the intervention improves fairness when deployed at early stages of the platform, but the effect decreases as the strength of pre-existing bias increases. Altogether, we find that the ordered pairwise comparison approach might offer a plausible alternative for both new and existing platforms to implement.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches either rely on text-only prompting or employ basic multimodal strategies that do not fully exploit the complementary information available from both textual and visual modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework, Cross-Reflection Prompting, termed X-Reflect, designed to address these limitations by prompting Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to explicitly identify and reconcile supportive and conflicting information between text and images. By capturing nuanced insights from both modalities, this approach generates more comprehensive and contextually rich item representations. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing prompting baselines in downstream recommendation accuracy. Furthermore, we identify a U-shaped relationship between text-image dissimilarity and recommendation performance, suggesting the benefit of applying multimodal prompting selectively. To support efficient real-time inference, we also introduce X-Reflect-keyword, a lightweight variant that summarizes image content using keywords and replaces the base model with a smaller backbone, achieving nearly 50% reduction in input length while maintaining competitive performance. This work underscores the importance of integrating multimodal information and presents an effective solution for improving item understanding in multimodal recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[HoMer: Addressing Heterogeneities by Modeling Sequential and Set-wise Contexts for CTR Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11100v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which models behavior sequence and non-sequential features (e.g., user/item profiles or cross features) to infer user interest, underpins industrial recommender systems. However, most methods face three forms of heterogeneity that degrade predictive performance: (i) Feature Heterogeneity persists when limited sequence side features provide less granular interest representation compared to extensive non-sequential features, thereby impairing sequence modeling performance; (ii) Context Heterogeneity arises because a user's interest in an item will be influenced by other items, yet point-wise prediction neglects cross-item interaction context from the entire item set; (iii) Architecture Heterogeneity stems from the fragmented integration of specialized network modules, which compounds the model's effectiveness, efficiency and scalability in industrial deployments. To tackle the above limitations, we propose HoMer, a Homogeneous-Oriented TransforMer for modeling sequential and set-wise contexts. First, we align sequence side features with non-sequential features for accurate sequence modeling and fine-grained interest representation. Second, we shift the prediction paradigm from point-wise to set-wise, facilitating cross-item interaction in a highly parallel manner. Third, HoMer's unified encoder-decoder architecture achieves dual optimization through structural simplification and shared computation, ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining scalability with model size. Without arduous modification to the prediction pipeline, HoMer successfully scales up and outperforms our industrial baseline by 0.0099 in the AUC metric, and enhances online business metrics like CTR/RPM by 1.99%/2.46%. Additionally, HoMer saves 27% of GPU resources via preliminary engineering optimization, further validating its superiority and practicality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[LEGO: A Lightweight and Efficient Multiple-Attribute Unlearning Framework for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20327v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at https://github.com/anonymifish/lego-rec-multiple-attribute-unlearning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |

However, the dynamic nature of user interests and content poses a significant challenge: While initial fine-tuning aligns LLMs with domain knowledge and user preferences, it fails to capture such real-time changes, necessitating robust update mechanisms. This paper investigates strategies for updating LLM-powered recommenders, focusing on the trade-offs between ongoing fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Using an LLM-powered user interest exploration system as a case study, we perform a comparative analysis of these methods across dimensions like cost, agility, and knowledge incorporation. We propose a hybrid update strategy that leverages the long-term knowledge adaptation of periodic fine-tuning with the agility of low-cost RAG. We demonstrate through live A/B experiments on a billion-user platform that this hybrid approach yields statistically significant improvements in user satisfaction, offering a practical and cost-effective framework for maintaining high-quality LLM-powered recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>RecSy...</summary><p>RecSys 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

Learning to Hash techniques have emerged as a promising solution to these issues by encoding high-dimensional data into compact hash codes. As a result, hashing-based recommendation methods (HashRec) have garnered growing attention for enabling large-scale and efficient recommendation services. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art HashRec algorithms. Specifically, we begin by introducing the common two-tower architecture used in the recall stage and by detailing two predominant hash search strategies. Then, we categorize existing works into a three-tier taxonomy based on: (i) learning objectives, (ii) optimization strategies, and (iii) recommendation scenarios. Additionally, we summarize widely adopted evaluation metrics for assessing both the effectiveness and efficiency of HashRec algorithms. Finally, we discuss current limitations in the field and outline promising directions for future research. We index these HashRec methods at the repository \href{https://github.com/Luo-Fangyuan/HashRec}{https://github.com/Luo-Fangyuan/HashRec}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Dynamic Embedding Size Search for Streaming Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15411v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems typically represent users and items by learning their embeddings, which are usually set to uniform dimensions and dominate the model parameters. However, real-world recommender systems often operate in streaming recommendation scenarios, where the number of users and items continues to grow, leading to substantial storage resource consumption for these embeddings. Although a few methods attempt to mitigate this by employing embedding size search strategies to assign different embedding dimensions in streaming recommendations, they assume that the embedding size grows with the frequency of users/items, which eventually still exceeds the predefined memory budget over time. To address this issue, this paper proposes to learn Scalable Lightweight Embeddings for streaming recommendation, called SCALL, which can adaptively adjust the embedding sizes of users/items within a given memory budget over time. Specifically, we propose to sample embedding sizes from a probabilistic distribution, with the guarantee to meet any predefined memory budget. By fixing the memory budget, the proposed embedding size sampling strategy can increase and decrease the embedding sizes in accordance to the frequency of the corresponding users or items. Furthermore, we develop a reinforcement learning-based search paradigm that models each state with mean pooling to keep the length of the state vectors fixed, invariant to the changing number of users and items. As a result, the proposed method can provide embedding sizes to unseen users and items. Comprehensive empirical evaluations on two public datasets affirm the advantageous effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to CIKM 2024 Code is available at https://github.com/qykcq/Scalable-Dynamic-Embedding-Size-Search-for-Streaming-Recommendation</p></details> |
| **[Budgeted Embedding Table For Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14884v7)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At the heart of contemporary recommender systems (RSs) are latent factor models that provide quality recommendation experience to users. These models use embedding vectors, which are typically of a uniform and fixed size, to represent users and items. As the number of users and items continues to grow, this design becomes inefficient and hard to scale. Recent lightweight embedding methods have enabled different users and items to have diverse embedding sizes, but are commonly subject to two major drawbacks. Firstly, they limit the embedding size search to optimizing a heuristic balancing the recommendation quality and the memory complexity, where the trade-off coefficient needs to be manually tuned for every memory budget requested. The implicitly enforced memory complexity term can even fail to cap the parameter usage, making the resultant embedding table fail to meet the memory budget strictly. Secondly, most solutions, especially reinforcement learning based ones derive and optimize the embedding size for each each user/item on an instance-by-instance basis, which impedes the search efficiency. In this paper, we propose Budgeted Embedding Table (BET), a novel method that generates table-level actions (i.e., embedding sizes for all users and items) that is guaranteed to meet pre-specified memory budgets. Furthermore, by leveraging a set-based action formulation and engaging set representation learning, we present an innovative action search strategy powered by an action fitness predictor that efficiently evaluates each table-level action. Experiments have shown state-of-the-art performance on two real-world datasets when BET is paired with three popular recommender models under different memory budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WSDM 2024.

| **[Continuous Input Embedding Size Search For Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03501v5)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent factor models are the most popular backbones for today's recommender systems owing to their prominent performance. Latent factor models represent users and items as real-valued embedding vectors for pairwise similarity computation, and all embeddings are traditionally restricted to a uniform size that is relatively large (e.g., 256-dimensional). With the exponentially expanding user base and item catalog in contemporary e-commerce, this design is admittedly becoming memory-inefficient. To facilitate lightweight recommendation, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently opened up opportunities for identifying varying embedding sizes for different users/items. However, challenged by search efficiency and learning an optimal RL policy, existing RL-based methods are restricted to highly discrete, predefined embedding size choices. This leads to a largely overlooked potential of introducing finer granularity into embedding sizes to obtain better recommendation effectiveness under a given memory budget. In this paper, we propose continuous input embedding size search (CIESS), a novel RL-based method that operates on a continuous search space with arbitrary embedding sizes to choose from. In CIESS, we further present an innovative random walk-based exploration strategy to allow the RL policy to efficiently explore more candidate embedding sizes and converge to a better decision. CIESS is also model-agnostic and hence generalizable to a variety of latent factor RSs, whilst experiments on two real-world datasets have shown state-of-the-art performance of CIESS under different memory budgets when paired with three popular recommendation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in SIGIR'23.

As a result, effectively capturing users' latest preferences is challenging, as interactions reflecting recent interests are limited and new items often lack sufficient feedback. A common solution is to enrich item representations using multimodal encoders (e.g., BERT or ViT) to extract visual and textual features. However, these encoders are pretrained on general-purpose tasks: they are not tailored to user preference modeling, and they overlook the fact that user tastes toward modality-specific features such as visual styles and textual tones can also drift over time. This presents two key challenges in streaming scenarios: the high cost of fine-tuning large multimodal encoders, and the risk of forgetting long-term user preferences due to continuous model updates. To tackle these challenges, we propose Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts (XSMoE), a memory-efficient framework for multimodal streaming recommendation. XSMoE attaches lightweight side-tuning modules consisting of expandable expert networks to frozen pretrained encoders and incrementally expands them in response to evolving user feedback. A gating router dynamically combines expert and backbone outputs, while a utilization-based pruning strategy maintains model compactness. By learning new patterns through expandable experts without overwriting previously acquired knowledge, XSMoE effectively captures both cold start and shifting preferences in multimodal features. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that XSMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both recommendation quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2025.

When voters have underlying utilities for these options, however, using preference rankings may lead to suboptimal outcomes vis-\`a-vis utilitarian social welfare. Distortion is a measure of this suboptimality, and provides a worst-case approach for developing and analyzing voting rules when utilities have minimal structure. However in many settings, such as common paradigms for value alignment, alternatives admit a vector representation, and it is natural to suppose that utilities are parametric functions thereof. We undertake the first study of distortion for linear utility functions. Specifically, we investigate the distortion of linear social choice for deterministic and randomized voting rules. We obtain bounds that depend only on the dimension of the candidate embedding, and are independent of the numbers of candidates or voters. Additionally, we introduce poly-time instance-optimal algorithms for minimizing distortion given a collection of candidates and votes. We empirically evaluate these in two real-world domains: recommendation systems using collaborative filtering embeddings, and opinion surveys utilizing language model embeddings, benchmarking several standard rules against our instance-optimal algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Even though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently, this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature. Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters trust in the outcome predictions.</p></details> |  |

A crucial aspect is embedding techniques that convert the high-dimensional discrete features, such as user and item IDs, into low-dimensional continuous vectors, which can enhance the recommendation performance. Embedding techniques have revolutionized the capture of complex entity relationships, generating significant research interest. This survey presents a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in recommender system embedding techniques. We examine centralized embedding approaches across matrix, sequential, and graph structures. In matrix-based scenarios, collaborative filtering generates embeddings that effectively model user-item preferences, particularly in sparse data environments. For sequential data, we explore various approaches including recurrent neural networks and self-supervised methods such as contrastive and generative learning. In graph-structured contexts, we analyze techniques like node2vec that leverage network relationships, along with applicable self-supervised methods. Our survey addresses critical scalability challenges in embedding methods and explores innovative directions in recommender systems. We introduce emerging approaches, including AutoML, hashing techniques, and quantization methods, to enhance performance while reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we examine the promising role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in embedding enhancement. Through detailed discussion of various architectures and methodologies, this survey aims to provide a thorough overview of state-of-the-art embedding techniques in recommender systems, while highlighting key challenges and future research directions.</p></details> | 47 pages |

However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank $r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Target-free User Simulation for Evaluating Conversational Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16160v4)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have tried to simulate real-world users engaging in conversations with CRSs to create more realistic testing environments that reflect the complexity of human-agent dialogue. Despite the significant advancements, reliably evaluating the capability of CRSs to elicit user preferences still faces a significant challenge. Existing evaluation metrics often rely on target-biased user simulators that assume users have predefined preferences, leading to interactions that devolve into simplistic guessing game. These simulators typically guide the CRS toward specific target items based on fixed attributes, limiting the dynamic exploration of user preferences and struggling to capture the evolving nature of real-user interactions. Additionally, current evaluation metrics are predominantly focused on single-turn recall of target items, neglecting the intermediate processes of preference elicitation. To address this, we introduce PEPPER, a novel CRS evaluation protocol with target-free user simulators constructed from real-user interaction histories and reviews. PEPPER enables realistic user-CRS dialogues without falling into simplistic guessing games, allowing users to gradually discover their preferences through enriched interactions, thereby providing a more accurate and reliable assessment of the CRS's ability to elicit personal preferences. Furthermore, PEPPER presents detailed measures for comprehensively evaluating the preference elicitation capabilities of CRSs, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative measures that capture four distinct aspects of the preference elicitation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the validity of PEPPER as a simulation environment and conduct a thorough analysis of how effectively existing CRSs perform in preference elicitation and recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

In this paper, we present MICRec, a unified framework that fuses inductive modeling, multimodal guidance, and cross-domain transfer to capture user contexts and latent preferences in heterogeneous and incomplete real-world data. Moving beyond the inductive backbone of INMO, our model refines expressive representations through modality-based aggregation and alleviates data sparsity by leveraging overlapping users as anchors across domains, thereby enabling robust and generalizable recommendation.

Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii) the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the reasoning behind these recommendations remains opaque, raising questions about their consistency, explainability, and alignment with traditional App Store Optimization (ASO) metrics. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of how widely-used general purpose LLMs generate, justify, and rank mobile app recommendations. Our contributions are: (i) a taxonomy of 16 generalizable ranking criteria elicited from LLM outputs; (ii) a systematic evaluation framework to analyse recommendation consistency and responsiveness to explicit ranking instructions; and (iii) a replication package to support reproducibility and future research on AI-based recommendation systems. Our findings reveal that LLMs rely on a broad yet fragmented set of ranking criteria, only partially aligned with standard ASO metrics. While top-ranked apps tend to be consistent across runs, variability increases with ranking depth and search specificity. LLMs exhibit varying sensitivity to explicit ranking instructions - ranging from substantial adaptations to near-identical outputs - highlighting their complex reasoning dynamics in conversational app discovery. Our results aim to support end-users, app developers, and recommender-systems researchers in navigating the emerging landscape of conversational app discovery.</p></details> | Under review |

Yet despite the existence of thousands of food banks and pantries, access remains fragmented: 1) current retrieval systems depend on static directories or generic search engines, which provide incomplete and geographically irrelevant results; 2) LLM-based chatbots offer only vague nutritional suggestions and fail to adapt to real-world constraints such as time, mobility, and transportation; and 3) existing food recommendation systems optimize for culinary diversity but overlook survival-critical needs of food-insecure populations, including immediate proximity, verified availability, and contextual barriers. These limitations risk leaving the most vulnerable individuals, those experiencing homelessness, addiction, or digital illiteracy, unable to access urgently needed resources. To address this, we introduce Food4All, the first multi-agent framework explicitly designed for real-time, context-aware free food retrieval. Food4All unifies three innovations: 1) heterogeneous data aggregation across official databases, community platforms, and social media to provide a continuously updated pool of food resources; 2) a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm trained on curated cases to optimize for both geographic accessibility and nutritional correctness; and 3) an online feedback loop that dynamically adapts retrieval policies to evolving user needs. By bridging information acquisition, semantic analysis, and decision support, Food4All delivers nutritionally annotated and guidance at the point of need. This framework establishes an urgent step toward scalable, equitable, and intelligent systems that directly support populations facing food insecurity and its compounding health risks.</p></details> |  |

Efforts have been made from the booking platform providers to utilize recommender systems in an effort to enable the user to filter the results by factors such as stars, amenities, cost but most valuable insights can be provided by the unstructured text-based reviews. Going through these reviews one-by-one requires a substantial amount of time to be devoted while a respectable percentage of the reviews won't provide to the user what they are actually looking for. This research publication explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance short rental apartments recommendations by summarizing and mining key insights from user reviews. The web application presented in this paper, named "instaGuide", automates the procedure of isolating the text-based user reviews from a property on the Booking.com platform, synthesizing the summary of the reviews, and enabling the user to query specific aspects of the property in an effort to gain feedback on their personal questions/criteria. During the development of the instaGuide tool, numerous LLM models were evaluated based on accuracy, cost, and response quality. The results suggest that the LLM-powered summarization reduces significantly the amount of time the users need to devote on their search for the right short rental apartment, improving the overall decision-making procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[DrunkAgent: Stealthy Memory Corruption in LLM-Powered Recommender Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23804v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are increasingly used in recommender systems (RSs) to achieve personalized behavior modeling, where the memory mechanism plays a pivotal role in enabling the agents to autonomously explore, learn and self-evolve from real-world interactions. However, this very mechanism, serving as a contextual repository, inherently exposes an attack surface for potential adversarial manipulations. Despite its central role, the robustness of agentic RSs in the face of such threats remains largely underexplored. Previous works suffer from semantic mismatches or rely on static embeddings or pre-defined prompts, all of which are not designed for dynamic systems, especially for dynamic memory states of LLM agents. This challenge is exacerbated by the black-box nature of commercial recommenders. To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of memory-based vulnerabilities in LLM-powered recommender agents, revealing their security limitations and guiding efforts to strengthen system resilience and trustworthiness. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent crafts semantically meaningful adversarial textual triggers for target item promotions and introduces a series of strategies to maximize the trigger effect by corrupting the memory updates during the interactions. The triggers and strategies are optimized on a surrogate model, enabling DrunkAgent transferable and stealthy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets across diverse agentic RSs, including collaborative filtering, retrieval augmentation and sequential recommendations, demonstrate the generalizability, transferability and stealthiness of DrunkAgent.</p></details> |  |
| **[From AutoRecSys to AutoRecLab: A Call to Build, Evaluate, and Govern Autonomous Recommender-Systems Research Labs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18104v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender-systems research has accelerated model and evaluation advances, yet largely neglects automating the research process itself. We argue for a shift from narrow AutoRecSys tools -- focused on algorithm selection and hyper-parameter tuning -- to an Autonomous Recommender-Systems Research Lab (AutoRecLab) that integrates end-to-end automation: problem ideation, literature analysis, experimental design and execution, result interpretation, manuscript drafting, and provenance logging. Drawing on recent progress in automated science (e.g., multi-agent AI Scientist and AI Co-Scientist systems), we outline an agenda for the RecSys community: (1) build open AutoRecLab prototypes that combine LLM-driven ideation and reporting with automated experimentation; (2) establish benchmarks and competitions that evaluate agents on producing reproducible RecSys findings with minimal human input; (3) create review venues for transparently AI-generated submissions; (4) define standards for attribution and reproducibility via detailed research logs and metadata; and (5) foster interdisciplinary dialogue on ethics, governance, privacy, and fairness in autonomous research. Advancing this agenda can increase research throughput, surface non-obvious insights, and position RecSys to contribute to emerging Artificial Research Intelligence. We conclude with a call to organise a community retreat to coordinate next steps and co-author guidance for the responsible integration of automated research systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visibility Allocation Systems: How Algorithmic Design Shapes Online Visibility and Societal Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17241v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Throughout application domains, we now rely extensively on algorithmic systems to engage with ever-expanding datasets of information. Despite their benefits, these systems are often complex (comprising of many intricate tools, e.g., moderation, recommender systems, prediction models), of unknown structure (due to the lack of accompanying documentation), and having hard-to-predict yet potentially severe downstream consequences (due to the extensive use, systematic enactment of existing errors, and many comprising feedback loops). As such, understanding and evaluating these systems as a whole remains a challenge for both researchers and legislators. To aid ongoing efforts, we introduce a formal framework for such visibility allocation systems (VASs) which we define as (semi-)automated systems deciding which (processed) data to present a human user with. We review typical tools comprising VASs and define the associated computational problems they solve. By doing so, VASs can be decomposed into sub-processes and illustrated via data flow diagrams. Moreover, we survey metrics for evaluating VASs throughout the pipeline, thus aiding system diagnostics. Using forecasting-based recommendations in school choice as a case study, we demonstrate how our framework can support VAS evaluation. We also discuss how our framework can support ongoing AI-legislative efforts to locate obligations, quantify systemic risks, and enable adaptive compliance.</p></details> |  |

These systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations. A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics 2025</p></details> |
| **[Large-scale User Game Lifecycle Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15412v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of video game production necessitates the development of effective advertising and recommendation systems for online game platforms. Recommending and advertising games to users hinges on capturing their interest in games. However, existing representation learning methods crafted for handling billions of items in recommendation systems are unsuitable for game advertising and recommendation. This is primarily due to game sparsity, where the mere hundreds of games fall short for large-scale user representation learning, and game imbalance, where user behaviors are overwhelmingly dominated by a handful of popular games. To address the sparsity issue, we introduce the User Game Lifecycle (UGL), designed to enrich user behaviors in games. Additionally, we propose two innovative strategies aimed at manipulating user behaviors to more effectively extract both short and long-term interests. To tackle the game imbalance challenge, we present an Inverse Probability Masking strategy for UGL representation learning. The offline and online experimental results demonstrate that the UGL representations significantly enhance model by achieving a 1.83% AUC offline increase on average and a 21.67% CVR online increase on average for game advertising and a 0.5% AUC offline increase and a 0.82% ARPU online increase for in-game item recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Treatment Effects under Recommender Interference: A Structured Neural Networks Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14380v4)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are essential for content-sharing platforms by curating personalized content. To improve recommender systems, platforms frequently rely on creator-side randomized experiments to evaluate algorithm updates. We show that commonly adopted difference-in-means estimators can lead to severely biased estimates due to recommender interference, where treated and control creators compete for exposure. This bias can result in incorrect business decisions. To address this, we propose a ``recommender choice model'' that explicitly represents the interference pathway. The approach combines a structural choice framework with neural networks to account for rich viewer-content heterogeneity. Building on this foundation, we develop a debiased estimator using the double machine learning (DML) framework to adjust for errors from nuisance component estimation. We show that the estimator is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically normal, and we extend the DML theory to handle correlated data, which arise in our context due to overlapped items. We validate our method with a large-scale field experiment on Weixin short-video platform, using a costly double-sided randomization design to obtain an interference-free ground truth. Our results show that the proposed estimator successfully recovers this ground truth, whereas benchmark estimators exhibit substantial bias, and in some cases, yield reversed signs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically assume static graphs, while real-world graphs are continuously evolving. This dynamic nature requires models to adapt to new data while preserving existing knowledge. To this end, this work introduces HERO (HEterogeneous continual gRaph learning via meta-knOwledge distillation), a unified framework for continual learning on heterogeneous graphs. HERO employs meta-adaptation, a gradient-based meta-learning strategy that provides directional guidance for rapid adaptation to new tasks with limited samples. To enable efficient and effective knowledge reuse, we propose DiSCo (Diversity Sampling with semantic Consistency), a heterogeneity-aware sampling method that maximizes target node diversity and expands subgraphs along metapaths, retaining critical semantic and structural information with minimal overhead. Furthermore, HERO incorporates heterogeneity-aware knowledge distillation, which aligns knowledge at both the node and semantic levels to balance adaptation and retention across tasks. Extensive experiments on four web-related heterogeneous graph benchmarks demonstrate that HERO substantially mitigates catastrophic forgetting while achieving efficient and consistent knowledge reuse in dynamic web environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated version with new LaTeX template and minor formatting revisions, added references and experimental results</p></details> |

This paper discusses the consequences of such recommendation on market concentration and inequality. Binary types denoting a statistical majority and minority are noisily revealed through a statistical experiment. The achievable utilities and recommendation shares for the two groups can be analyzed as a Bayesian Persuasion problem. While under arbitrary noise structures, effects on concentration compared to a full-information market are ambiguous, under symmetric noise, concentration increases and consumer welfare becomes more unequal. We define symmetric statistical experiments and analyze persuasion under a restriction to such experiments, which may be of independent interest.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

| **[XR-1: Towards Versatile Vision-Language-Action Models via Learning Unified Vision-Motion Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02776v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large-scale robotic datasets and vision-language models (VLMs) has advanced research on vision-language-action (VLA) models. However, existing VLA models still face two fundamental challenges: (i) producing precise low-level actions from high-dimensional observations, (ii) bridging domain gaps across heterogeneous data sources, including diverse robot embodiments and human demonstrations. Existing methods often encode latent variables from either visual dynamics or robotic actions to guide policy learning, but they fail to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal knowledge present in large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. In this work, we present X Robotic Model 1 (XR-1), a novel framework for versatile and scalable VLA learning across diverse robots, tasks, and environments. XR-1 introduces the \emph{Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC)}, a discrete latent representation learned via a dual-branch VQ-VAE that jointly encodes visual dynamics and robotic motion. UVMC addresses these challenges by (i) serving as an intermediate representation between the observations and actions, and (ii) aligning multimodal dynamic information from heterogeneous data sources to capture complementary knowledge. To effectively exploit UVMC, we propose a three-stage training paradigm: (i) self-supervised UVMC learning, (ii) UVMC-guided pretraining on large-scale cross-embodiment robotic datasets, and (iii) task-specific post-training. We validate XR-1 through extensive real-world experiments with more than 14,000 rollouts on six different robot embodiments, spanning over 120 diverse manipulation tasks. XR-1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as $\pi_{0.5}$, $\pi_0$, RDT, UniVLA, and GR00T-N1.5 while demonstrating strong generalization to novel objects, background variations, distractors, and illumination changes.

| **[DANIEL: A Distributed and Scalable Approach for Global Representation Learning with EHR Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02754v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical probabilistic graphical models face fundamental challenges in modern data environments, which are characterized by high dimensionality, source heterogeneity, and stringent data-sharing constraints. In this work, we revisit the Ising model, a well-established member of the Markov Random Field (MRF) family, and develop a distributed framework that enables scalable and privacy-preserving representation learning from large-scale binary data with inherent low-rank structure. Our approach optimizes a non-convex surrogate loss function via bi-factored gradient descent, offering substantial computational and communication advantages over conventional convex approaches. We evaluate our algorithm on multi-institutional electronic health record (EHR) datasets from 58,248 patients across the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and Mass General Brigham (MGB), demonstrating superior performance in global representation learning and downstream clinical tasks, including relationship detection, patient phenotyping, and patient clustering. These results highlight a broader potential for statistical inference in federated, high-dimensional settings while addressing the practical challenges of data complexity and multi-institutional integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modality-Transition Representation Learning for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02685v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently outperforms existing SOTAs on three typical VI-ReID datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Graph Neural Networks for Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02531v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRAM-DTI: adaptive multimodal representation learning for drug target interaction prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21971v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a cornerstone of computational drug discovery, enabling rational design, repurposing, and mechanistic insights. While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements, when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[SKGE: Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding with Geometric Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02460v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for representation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as TransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent limitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training. In this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model that challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a compact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear Spherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as a hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate that SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean counterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237 and CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We provide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing that this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to comprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally, we prove that the spherical geometry creates an "inherently hard negative sampling" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the model to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our findings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for geometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful and stable KGE models.</p></details> |  |

While most existing methods rely on contrastive learning, we explore an alternative approach by framing place recognition as a multi-class classification problem. Our method assigns discrete location labels to LiDAR scans and trains an encoder-decoder model to classify each scan's position directly. We evaluate this approach on the NuScenes dataset and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to contrastive learning-based methods while offering advantages in training efficiency and stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniCoD: Enhancing Robot Policy via Unified Continuous and Discrete Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10642v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building generalist robot policies that can handle diverse tasks in open-ended environments is a central challenge in robotics. To leverage knowledge from large-scale pretraining, prior work (VLA) has typically built generalist policies either on top of vision-language understanding models (VLMs) or generative models. However, both semantic understanding from vision-language pretraining and visual dynamics modeling from visual-generation pretraining are crucial for embodied robots. Recent unified models of generation and understanding have demonstrated strong capabilities in both comprehension and generation through large-scale pretraining. We posit that robotic policy learning can likewise benefit from the combined strengths of understanding, planning, and continuous future representation learning. Building on this insight, we introduce UniCoD, which acquires the ability to dynamically model high-dimensional visual features through pretraining on over 1M internet-scale instructional manipulation videos. Subsequently, UniCoD is fine-tuned on data collected from the robot embodiment, enabling the learning of mappings from predictive representations to action tokens. Extensive experiments show our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of 9\% and 12\% across simulation environments and real-world out-of-distribution tasks.</p></details> |  |

While the segmentation of camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation. However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2025), 8 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Latent Zoning Network: A Unified Principle for Generative Modeling, Representation Learning, and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15591v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three core problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN) as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images, text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently (representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously (joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders, LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA classification accuracy on CIFAR10. The code and trained models are available at https://github.com/microsoft/latent-zoning-networks.

| **[Measuring the Intrinsic Dimension of Earth Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02101v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the context of representation learning for Earth observation, geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed low-dimensional location inputs (longitude, latitude) into high-dimensional embeddings, through models trained on geo-referenced satellite, image or text data. Despite the common aim of geographic INRs to distill Earth's data into compact, learning-friendly representations, we lack an understanding of how much information is contained in these Earth representations, and where that information is concentrated. The intrinsic dimension of a dataset measures the number of degrees of freedom required to capture its local variability, regardless of the ambient high-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This work provides the first study of the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic INRs. Analyzing INRs with ambient dimension between 256 and 512, we find that their intrinsic dimensions fall roughly between 2 and 10 and are sensitive to changing spatial resolution and input modalities during INR pre-training. Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic dimension of a geographic INR correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts, facilitating model evaluation and diagnostics. More broadly, our work offers an architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content that can enable unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INRs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print. 27 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We study the setting where such structure is captured by a common representation of data. Unlike multi-task learning or learning-to-learn, where tasks are available upfront to learn the representation, lifelong learning requires the learner to make use of its existing knowledge while continually gathering partial information in an online fashion. In this paper, we consider a generalized framework of lifelong representation learning. We propose a simple algorithm that uses multi-task empirical risk minimization as a subroutine and establish a sample complexity bound based on a new notion we introduce--the task-eluder dimension. Our result applies to a wide range of learning problems involving general function classes. As concrete examples, we instantiate our result on classification and regression tasks under noise.</p></details> |  |

However, existing training pipelines are often inflexible, domain-specific, or computationally expensive, which limits their usability across different domains and resource settings. DINO-MX is a modular and extensible training framework that combines the core principles of DINO, DINOv2 and DINOv3 within a unified configuration-driven system. It supports a variety of transformer-based architectures and is fully compatible with the Hugging Face ecosystem. The framework includes multiple training strategies such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), layer freezing, and knowledge distillation, along with support for distributed training through both Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) and Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP). DINO-MX is designed to work with both natural and specialized data types, including single- and multi-channel images. Experimental results on diverse datasets show that DINO-MX achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational costs. Additionally, it offers interpretability tools and a label-guided data augmentation method that improves attention-based localization without the need for extra detection or segmentation heads. DINO-MX provides a reproducible and scalable foundation for developing, adapting, and benchmarking self-supervised vision models across a range of research and real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

While Deep Modularity Networks (DMoN) leverage modularity maximization and collapse regularization to ensure structural separation, they lack explicit mechanisms for feature-space separation, assignment dispersion, and assignment-confidence control. We address this limitation by proposing Deep Modularity Networks with Diversity-Preserving Regularization (DMoN-DPR), which introduces three novel regularization terms: distance-based for inter-cluster separation, variance-based for per-cluster assignment dispersion, and an assignment-entropy penalty with a small positive weight, encouraging more confident assignments gradually. Our method significantly enhances label-based clustering metrics on feature-rich benchmark datasets (paired two-tailed t-test, $p\leq0.05$), demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating diversity-preserving regularizations in creating meaningful and interpretable clusters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: New Perspectives in Graph Machine Learning (NPGML)</p></details> |
| **[SynBrain: Enhancing Visual-to-fMRI Synthesis via Probabilistic Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10298v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance.

| **[From Pixels to Cooperation Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning based on Multimodal World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01310v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning cooperative multi-agent policies directly from high-dimensional, multimodal sensory inputs like pixels and audio (from pixels) is notoriously sample-inefficient. Model-free Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms struggle with the joint challenge of representation learning, partial observability, and credit assignment. To address this, we propose a novel framework based on a shared, generative Multimodal World Model (MWM). Our MWM is trained to learn a compressed latent representation of the environment's dynamics by fusing distributed, multimodal observations from all agents using a scalable attention-based mechanism. Subsequently, we leverage this learned MWM as a fast, "imagined" simulator to train cooperative MARL policies (e.g., MAPPO) entirely within its latent space, decoupling representation learning from policy learning. We introduce a new set of challenging multimodal, multi-agent benchmarks built on a 3D physics simulator. Our experiments demonstrate that our MWM-MARL framework achieves orders-of-magnitude greater sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art model-free MARL baselines. We further show that our proposed multimodal fusion is essential for task success in environments with sensory asymmetry and that our architecture provides superior robustness to sensor-dropout, a critical feature for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Focused Video Group Activities Hashing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00490v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH (multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence-aware Causal Autoencoder Network for Node Importance Ranking in Complex Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01228v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node importance ranking is a fundamental problem in graph data analysis. Existing approaches typically rely on node features derived from either traditional centrality measures or advanced graph representation learning methods, which depend directly on the target network's topology. However, this reliance on structural information raises privacy concerns and often leads to poor generalization across different networks. In this work, we address a key question: Can we design a node importance ranking model trained exclusively on synthetic networks that is effectively appliable to real-world networks, eliminating the need to rely on the topology of target networks and improving both practicality and generalizability? We answer this question affirmatively by proposing the Influence-aware Causal Autoencoder Network (ICAN), a novel framework that leverages causal representation learning to get robust, invariant node embeddings for cross-network ranking tasks. Firstly, ICAN introduces an influence-aware causal representation learning module within an autoencoder architecture to extract node embeddings that are causally related to node importance. Moreover, we introduce a causal ranking loss and design a unified optimization framework that jointly optimizes the reconstruction and ranking objectives, enabling mutual reinforcement between node representation learning and ranking optimization. This design allows ICAN, trained on synthetic networks, to generalize effectively across diverse real-world graphs. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ICAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both ranking accuracy and generalization capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generalized Bisimulation Metric of State Similarity between Markov Decision Processes: From Theoretical Propositions to Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18714v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for computing state similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Anatomically Constrained Transformers for Echocardiogram Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01109v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video transformers have recently demonstrated strong potential for echocardiogram (echo) analysis, leveraging self-supervised pre-training and flexible adaptation across diverse tasks. However, like other models operating on videos, they are prone to learning spurious correlations from non-diagnostic regions such as image backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Video Anatomically Constrained Transformer (ViACT), a novel framework that integrates anatomical priors directly into the transformer architecture. ViACT represents a deforming anatomical structure as a point set and encodes both its spatial geometry and corresponding image patches into transformer tokens. During pre-training, ViACT follows a masked autoencoding strategy that masks and reconstructs only anatomical patches, enforcing that representation learning is focused on the anatomical region. The pre-trained model can then be fine-tuned for tasks localized to this region. In this work we focus on the myocardium, demonstrating the framework on echo analysis tasks such as left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) regression and cardiac amyloidosis (CA) detection. The anatomical constraint focuses transformer attention within the myocardium, yielding interpretable attention maps aligned with regions of known CA pathology. Moreover, ViACT generalizes to myocardium point tracking without requiring task-specific components such as correlation volumes used in specialized tracking networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Geometry of Grokking: Norm Minimization on the Zero-Loss Manifold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01938v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grokking is a puzzling phenomenon in neural networks where full generalization occurs only after a substantial delay following the complete memorization of the training data. Previous research has linked this delayed generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic-Aware Representation Learning via Conditional Transport for Multi-Label Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14918v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-label image classification is a critical task in machine learning that aims to accurately assign multiple labels to a single image. While existing methods often utilize attention mechanisms or graph convolutional networks to model visual representations, their performance is still constrained by two critical limitations: the inability to learn discriminative semantic-aware features, and the lack of fine-grained alignment between visual representations and label embeddings. To tackle these issues in a unified framework, this paper proposes a novel approach named Semantic-aware representation learning via Conditional Transport for Multi-Label Image Classification (SCT). The proposed method introduces a semantic-related feature learning module that extracts discriminative label-specific features by emphasizing semantic relevance and interaction, along with a conditional transport-based alignment mechanism that enables precise visual-semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on two widely-used benchmark datasets, VOC2007 and MS-COCO, validate the effectiveness of SCT and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |

However, existing methods for multimodal document retrieval often replicate techniques developed for text-only retrieval, whether in how they encode documents, define training objectives, or compute similarity scores. To address these limitations, we present ColMate, a document retrieval model that bridges the gap between multimodal representation learning and document retrieval. ColMate utilizes a novel OCR-based pretraining objective, a self-supervised masked contrastive learning objective, and a late interaction scoring mechanism more relevant to multimodal document structures and visual characteristics. ColMate obtains 3.61% improvements over existing retrieval models on the ViDoRe V2 benchmark, demonstrating stronger generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Despite promising developments in the evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support, unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning. Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.5% in the Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.1% AUC gain.</p></details> | Technical Report |

These limitations restrict their expressiveness, personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets, nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Repetition-Invariant Representations for Polymer Informatics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10726v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polymers are large macromolecules composed of repeating structural units known as monomers and are widely applied in fields such as energy storage, construction, medicine, and aerospace. However, existing graph neural network methods, though effective for small molecules, only model the single unit of polymers and fail to produce consistent vector representations for the true polymer structure with varying numbers of units. To address this challenge, we introduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer representations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their graph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree alignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and data perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal augmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning. GRIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both homopolymer and copolymer benchmarks, learning stable, repetition-invariant representations that generalize effectively to polymer chains of unseen sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, the existing diffusion-based paradigm often struggles to capture strong temporal dependencies across multiple steps, particularly when incorporating proprioceptive input. This limitation can lead to task failures, where the policy overfits to proprioceptive cues at the expense of capturing the visually derived features of the task. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Deep Koopman-boosted Dual-branch Diffusion Policy (D3P) algorithm. D3P introduces a dual-branch architecture to decouple the roles of different sensory modality combinations. The visual branch encodes the visual observations to indicate task progression, while the fused branch integrates both visual and proprioceptive inputs for precise manipulation. Within this architecture, when the robot fails to accomplish intermediate goals, such as grasping a drawer handle, the policy can dynamically switch to execute action chunks generated by the visual branch, allowing recovery to previously observed states and facilitating retrial of the task. To further enhance visual representation learning, we incorporate a Deep Koopman Operator module that captures structured temporal dynamics from visual inputs. During inference, we use the test-time loss of the generative model as a confidence signal to guide the aggregation of the temporally overlapping predicted action chunks, thereby enhancing the reliability of policy execution. In simulation experiments across six RLBench tabletop tasks, D3P outperforms the state-of-the-art diffusion policy by an average of 14.6\%. On three real-world robotic manipulation tasks, it achieves a 15.0\% improvement.

| **[FedMGP: Personalized Federated Learning with Multi-Group Text-Visual Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00480v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce FedMGP, a new paradigm for personalized federated prompt learning in vision-language models. FedMGP equips each client with multiple groups of paired textual and visual prompts, enabling the model to capture diverse, fine-grained semantic and instance-level cues. A diversity loss is introduced to drive each prompt group to specialize in distinct and complementary semantic aspects, ensuring that the groups collectively cover a broader range of local characteristics. During communication, FedMGP employs a dynamic prompt aggregation strategy based on similarity-guided probabilistic sampling: each client computes the cosine similarity between its prompt groups and the global prompts from the previous round, then samples s groups via a softmax-weighted distribution. This soft selection mechanism preferentially aggregates semantically aligned knowledge while still enabling exploration of underrepresented patterns effectively balancing the preservation of common knowledge with client-specific features. Notably, FedMGP maintains parameter efficiency by redistributing a fixed prompt capacity across multiple groups, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest communication parameters among all federated prompt learning methods. Theoretical analysis shows that our dynamic aggregation strategy promotes robust global representation learning by reinforcing shared semantics while suppressing client-specific noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedMGP consistently outperforms prior approaches in both personalization and domain generalization across diverse federated vision-language benchmarks. The code will be released on https://github.com/weihao-bo/FedMGP.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying the Roles of LLM Layers in Retrieval, Knowledge, and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02091v3)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs) contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation, pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers -- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models.</p></details> | ICASSP 2025 |

Many such foundation models adopt approaches that have demonstrated success in computer vision with minimal domain-specific modification. However, the development and application of foundation models in this field are still burgeoning, as there are a variety of competing approaches for how to most effectively leverage remotely sensed data. This paper examines these approaches, along with their roots in the computer vision field. This is done to characterize potential advantages and pitfalls, while outlining future directions to further improve remote sensing-specific foundation models. We discuss the quality of the learned representations and methods to alleviate the need for massive compute resources. We first examine single-sensor remote foundation models to introduce concepts and provide context, and then place emphasis on incorporating the multi-sensor aspect of Earth observations into foundation models. In particular, we explore the extent to which existing approaches leverage multiple sensors in training foundation models in relation to multi-modal foundation models. Finally, we identify opportunities for further harnessing the vast amounts of unlabeled, seasonal, and multi-sensor remote sensing observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, submitted to ACM SigSpatial, currently under peer review.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been one of the most impactful techniques in modeling high-dimensional latent variables in this context. However, the limited expressiveness of the inference model based on traditional VAEs can still hinder the estimation performance. We introduce Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB) algorithms as an improvement to VAEs for IFA with improved flexibility and accuracy. By bridging the strengths of VAEs and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), AVB incorporates an auxiliary discriminator network to reframe the estimation process as a two-player adversarial game and removes the restrictive assumption of standard normal distributions in the inference model. Theoretically, AVB can achieve similar or higher likelihood compared to VAEs. A further enhanced algorithm, Importance-weighted Adversarial Variational Bayes (IWAVB) is proposed and compared with Importance-weighted Autoencoders (IWAE). In an exploratory analysis of empirical data, IWAVB demonstrated superior expressiveness by achieving a higher likelihood compared to IWAE. In confirmatory analysis with simulated data, IWAVB achieved similar mean-square error results to IWAE while consistently achieving higher likelihoods. When latent variables followed a multimodal distribution, IWAVB outperformed IWAE. With its innovative use of GANs, IWAVB is shown to have the potential to extend IFA to handle large-scale data, facilitating the potential integration of psychometrics and multimodal data analysis.</p></details> |  |

At their core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw. The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small, imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision. Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Effect of Domain Generalization Techniques in Low Resource Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27512v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models typically assume that training and test data follow the same distribution, an assumption that often fails in real-world scenarios due to distribution shifts. This issue is especially pronounced in low-resource settings, where data scarcity and limited domain diversity hinder robust generalization. Domain generalization (DG) approaches address this challenge by learning features that remain invariant across domains, often using causal mechanisms to improve model robustness. In this study, we examine two distinct causal DG techniques in low-resource natural language tasks. First, we investigate a causal data augmentation (CDA) approach that automatically generates counterfactual examples to improve robustness to spurious correlations. We apply this method to sentiment classification on the NaijaSenti Twitter corpus, expanding the training data with semantically equivalent paraphrases to simulate controlled distribution shifts. Second, we explore an invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) approach using the DINER framework, originally proposed for debiasing aspect-based sentiment analysis. We adapt DINER to a multilingual setting. Our findings demonstrate that both approaches enhance robustness to unseen domains: counterfactual data augmentation yields consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment classification, while causal representation learning with DINER improves out-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, albeit with varying gains across languages.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages representation learning through a shared neural network model, where all clients share fixed layers, except for a client-specific final layer. This structure captures shared features among clients while enabling individual adaptation, making it a promising approach for leveraging client data and computational power in heterogeneous federated settings to learn personalized models. To learn the model, we employ an alternating gradient descent strategy: each client optimizes its local model, updates its final layer, and sends estimates of the shared representation to a central server for aggregation. To defend against Byzantine agents, we employ two robust aggregation methods for client-server communication, Geometric Median and Krum. Our method enables personalized learning while maintaining resilience in distributed settings. We implemented the proposed algorithm in a federated testbed built using Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform and compared its performance with various benchmark algorithms and their variations. Through experiments using real-world datasets, including CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST, we demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our approach and its transferability to new unseen clients with limited data, even in the presence of Byzantine adversaries.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Neural Networks, particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network, a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation. The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and clear advantages of our approach.</p></details> |  |

While model-agnostic frameworks such as Shapley values have proved to be convenient and popular, they rarely align with the kinds of causal explanations that are typically sought after. Counterfactual case-based explanations, where an individual is informed of which circumstances would need to be different to cause a change in outcome, may be more intuitive and actionable. However, finding appropriate counterfactual cases is an open challenge, as is interpreting which features are most critical for the change in outcome. Here, we pose the question of counterfactual search and interpretation in terms of similarity learning, exploiting the representation learned by the random forest predictive model itself. Once a counterfactual is found, the feature importance of the explanation is computed as a function of which random forest partitions are crossed in order to reach it from the original instance. We demonstrate this method on both the MNIST hand-drawn digit dataset and the German credit dataset, finding that it generates explanations that are sparser and more useful than Shapley values.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at XAI-FIN-2025: International Joint Workshop on Explainable AI in Finance: Achieving Trustworthy Financial Decision-Making; November 15, 2025; Singapore</p></details> |
| **[Soft Task-Aware Routing of Experts for Equivariant Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27222v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings. Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Spatial normalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference, but often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when localization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted brain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between individuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i) learns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from multi-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive objectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to region-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a transformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of channels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal ganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording sessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space supports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear, region-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The transformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or supervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of masked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding. Together, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject aggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task structure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Incremental Human-Object Interaction Detection with Invariant Relation Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27020v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models. Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs.

| **[CARE: Contrastive Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16988v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation) fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clone Deterministic 3D Worlds with Geometrically-Regularized World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26782v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves. Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment. GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks, GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniTok-Audio: A Unified Audio Generation Framework via Generative Modeling on Discrete Codec Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26372v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling has recently achieved remarkable success across text, image, and audio domains, demonstrating powerful capabilities for unified representation learning. However, audio generation models still face challenges in terms of audio quality and generalization ability across tasks. This fragmentation results in redundant development efforts, inconsistent performance, and limited extensibility. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{UniTok-Audio}, a scalable and extensible framework for unified audio generation tasks. Specifically, 1) UniTok-Audio extracts continuous feature of conditions to generates discrete tokens of target audio in an autoregressive manner; 2) a special task identifier token unifies different learning patterns of multiple tasks in a single framework; 3) a dual-stream audio codec involving acoustic and semantic branch is developed for high-fidelity waveform reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that UniTok-Audio achieves competitive performance in comparation with state-of-the-art task-specific or multi-task systems across five time-aligned tasks: speech restoration, target speaker extraction, speech separation, voice conversion, and language-queried audio source separation. To foster future research, we will open-source our codebase. The demo page of our work can be found here: https://alibaba.github.io/unified-audio.</p></details> | 21 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Understanding Hardness of Vision-Language Compositionality from A Token-level Causal Lens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26302v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential, language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text, proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially, token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReaKase-8B: Legal Case Retrieval via Knowledge and Reasoning Representations with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26178v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legal case retrieval (LCR) is a cornerstone of real-world legal decision making, as it enables practitioners to identify precedents for a given query case. Existing approaches mainly rely on traditional lexical models and pretrained language models to encode the texts of legal cases. Yet there are rich information in the relations among different legal entities as well as the crucial reasoning process that uncovers how legal facts and legal issues can lead to judicial decisions. Such relational reasoning process reflects the distinctive characteristics of each case that can distinguish one from another, mirroring the real-world judicial process. Naturally, incorporating such information into the precise case embedding could further enhance the accuracy of case retrieval. In this paper, a novel ReaKase-8B framework is proposed to leverage extracted legal facts, legal issues, legal relation triplets and legal reasoning for effective legal case retrieval. ReaKase-8B designs an in-context legal case representation learning paradigm with a fine-tuned large language model. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets from COLIEE 2022 and COLIEE 2023 demonstrate that our knowledge and reasoning augmented embeddings substantially improve retrieval performance over baseline models, highlighting the potential of integrating legal reasoning into legal case retrieval systems. The code has been released on https://github.com/yanran-tang/ReaKase-8B.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging the Gap Between Molecule and Textual Descriptions via Substructure-aware Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26157v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information. However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks, highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text learning.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 (main) |

However, existing approaches typically adopt modality-centric modeling strategies that process ID-based and multimodal embeddings independently, failing to capture fine-grained interactions between content semantics and behavioral signals. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Multimodal Fusion (DMF), which introduces a modality-enriched modeling strategy to enable fine-grained interactions between ID-based collaborative representations and multimodal representations for user interest modeling. Specifically, we construct target-aware features to bridge the semantic gap across different embedding spaces and leverage them as side information to enhance the effectiveness of user interest modeling. Furthermore, we design an inference-optimized attention mechanism that decouples the computation of target-aware features and ID-based embeddings before the attention layer, thereby alleviating the computational bottleneck introduced by incorporating target-aware features. To achieve comprehensive multimodal integration, DMF combines user interest representations learned under the modality-centric and modality-enriched modeling strategies. Offline experiments on public and industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DMF. Moreover, DMF has been deployed on the product recommendation system of the international e-commerce platform Lazada, achieving relative improvements of 5.30% in CTCVR and 7.43% in GMV with negligible computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Geometry: A Framework for Building Adaptive Manifold Models through Metric Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26068v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology, thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data, while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of "data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Dual Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Discrete-Time Survival Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26014v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains when incorporated into the Consurv framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 workshop Learning from Time Series for Health (TS4H)</p></details> |
| **[Ditch the Denoiser: Emergence of Noise Robustness in Self-Supervised Learning from Data Curriculum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12191v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has become a powerful solution to extract rich representations from unlabeled data. Yet, SSL research is mostly focused on clean, curated and high-quality datasets. As a result, applying SSL on noisy data remains a challenge, despite being crucial to applications such as astrophysics, medical imaging, geophysics or finance. In this work, we present a fully self-supervised framework that enables noise-robust representation learning without requiring a denoiser at inference or downstream fine-tuning. Our method first trains an SSL denoiser on noisy data, then uses it to construct a denoised-to-noisy data curriculum (i.e., training first on denoised, then noisy samples) for pretraining a SSL backbone (e.g., DINOv2), combined with a teacher-guided regularization that anchors noisy embeddings to their denoised counterparts. This process encourages the model to internalize noise robustness. Notably, the denoiser can be discarded after pretraining, simplifying deployment. On ImageNet-1k with ViT-B under extreme Gaussian noise ($\sigma=255$, SNR = 0.72 dB), our method improves linear probing accuracy by 4.8% over DINOv2, demonstrating that denoiser-free robustness can emerge from noise-aware pretraining.

| **[Dynamic Traceback Learning for Medical Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13267v4)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated medical report generation has demonstrated the potential to significantly reduce the workload associated with time-consuming medical reporting. Recent generative representation learning methods have shown promise in integrating vision and language modalities for medical report generation. However, when trained end-to-end and applied directly to medical image-to-text generation, they face two significant challenges: i) difficulty in accurately capturing subtle yet crucial pathological details, and ii) reliance on both visual and textual inputs during inference, leading to performance degradation in zero-shot inference when only images are available. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel multimodal dynamic traceback learning framework (DTrace). Specifically, we introduce a traceback mechanism to supervise the semantic validity of generated content and a dynamic learning strategy to adapt to various proportions of image and text input, enabling text generation without strong reliance on the input from both modalities during inference. The learning of cross-modal knowledge is enhanced by supervising the model to recover masked semantic information from a complementary counterpart. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR, demonstrate that the proposed DTrace framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |
| **[Quality-Aware Prototype Memory for Face Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07734v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prototype Memory is a powerful model for face representation learning. It enables training face recognition models on datasets of any size by generating prototypes (classifier weights) on the fly and efficiently utilizing them. Prototype Memory demonstrated strong results in many face recognition benchmarks. However, the algorithm of prototype generation, used in it, is prone to the problems of imperfectly calculated prototypes in case of low-quality or poorly recognizable faces in the images, selected for the prototype creation. All images of the same person presented in the mini-batch are used with equal weights, and the resulting averaged prototype can be contaminated by imperfect embeddings of low-quality face images. This may lead to misleading training signals and degrade the performance of the trained models. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective way to improve Prototype Memory with quality-aware prototype generation. Quality-Aware Prototype Memory uses different weights for images of different quality in the process of prototype generation. With this improvement, prototypes receive more informative signals from high-quality images and are less affected by low-quality ones. We propose and compare several methods of quality estimation and usage, perform extensive experiments on the different face recognition benchmarks and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model compared to the basic version of Prototype Memory.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this paper, we demonstrate why InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but from the learning of structured density ratios.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

Despite significant progress in AI and computer vision (CV), there remains a lack of benchmarks for assessing models' abilities to infer latent causality from complex visual data. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{\textbf{Causal3D}}, a novel and comprehensive benchmark that integrates structured data (tables) with corresponding visual representations (images) to evaluate causal reasoning. Designed within a systematic framework, Causal3D comprises 19 3D-scene datasets capturing diverse causal relations, views, and backgrounds, enabling evaluations across scenes of varying complexity. We assess multiple state-of-the-art methods, including classical causal discovery, causal representation learning, and large/vision-language models (LLMs/VLMs). Our experiments show that as causal structures grow more complex without prior knowledge, performance declines significantly, highlighting the challenges even advanced methods face in complex causal scenarios. Causal3D serves as a vital resource for advancing causal reasoning in CV and fostering trustworthy AI in critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Datasets link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/LLDDSS/Causal3D_Dataset</p></details> |

Current deep learning methods, despite their effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA (Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction). Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection systems without compromising accuracy.

In beat and downbeat tracking, for instance, different listeners may adopt various rhythmic interpretations, none of which would necessarily be incorrect. To address this, we propose a contrastive self-supervised pre-training approach that leverages multiple hypotheses about possible positive samples in the data. Our model is trained to learn representations compatible with different such hypotheses, which are selected with a knowledge-based scoring function to retain the most plausible ones. When fine-tuned on labeled data, our model outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks, showcasing the advantages of integrating domain knowledge with multi-hypothesis selection in music representation learning in particular.</p></details> |  |

We introduce TEMPEST (TransformErs froM comPressed rEpreSenTations), a method that exploits the inherent byte-stream structure of compressed files to design an effective tokenization and encoding strategy. By leveraging this compact encoding, a standard transformer can directly learn semantic representations from compressed data streams, bypassing the need for raw byte-level processing or full media decoding. Our proposal substantially reduces the number of tokens required for semantic classification, thereby lowering both computational complexity and memory usage. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, coding schemes, and modalities, we show that TEMPEST achieves accuracy competitive wit the state-of-the-art while delivering efficiency gains in memory and compute.</p></details> |  |

We propose IB-Inspired Normalization (IBNorm), a simple yet powerful family of methods grounded in the Information Bottleneck principle. IBNorm introduces bounded compression operations that encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while suppressing nuisance variability, yielding more informative representations while retaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization. Theoretically, we prove that IBNorm achieves a higher IB value and tighter generalization bounds than variance-centric methods. Empirically, IBNorm consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior.

| **[Improving time series estimation and prediction via transfer learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25236v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many time series in the literature with high dimension yet limited sample sizes, such as macroeconomic variables, and it is almost impossible to obtain efficient estimation and accurate prediction by using the corresponding datasets themselves. This paper fills the gap by introducing a novel representation-based transfer learning framework for vector autoregressive models, and information from related source datasets with rich observations can be leveraged to enhance estimation efficiency through representation learning. A two-stage regularized estimation procedure is proposed with well established non-asymptotic properties, and algorithms with alternating updates are suggested to search for the estimates. Our transfer learning framework can handle time series with varying sample sizes and asynchronous starting and/or ending time points, thereby offering remarkable flexibility in integrating information from diverse datasets. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed methodology, and its usefulness is demonstrated by an empirical analysis on 20 macroeconomic variables from Japan and another nine countries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Fair Graph Representations with Multi-view Information Bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25096v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases, propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jailbreak Transferability Emerges from Shared Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12913v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak transferability is the surprising phenomenon when an adversarial attack compromising one model also elicits harmful responses from other models. Despite widespread demonstrations, there is little consensus on why transfer is possible: is it a quirk of safety training, an artifact of model families, or a more fundamental property of representation learning? We present evidence that transferability emerges from shared representations rather than incidental flaws. Across 20 open-weight models and 33 jailbreak attacks, we find two factors that systematically shape transfer: (1) representational similarity under benign prompts, and (2) the strength of the jailbreak on the source model. To move beyond correlation, we show that deliberately increasing similarity through benign only distillation causally increases transfer. Our qualitative analyses reveal systematic transferability patterns across different types of jailbreaks. For example, persona-style jailbreaks transfer far more often than cipher-based prompts, consistent with the idea that natural-language attacks exploit models' shared representation space, whereas cipher-based attacks rely on idiosyncratic quirks that do not generalize. Together, these results reframe jailbreak transfer as a consequence of representation alignment rather than a fragile byproduct of safety training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Eigenfunction Extraction for Ordered Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24672v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in representation learning reveal that widely used objectives, such as contrastive and non-contrastive, implicitly perform spectral decomposition of a contextual kernel, induced by the relationship between inputs and their contexts. Yet, these methods recover only the linear span of top eigenfunctions of the kernel, whereas exact spectral decomposition is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance. In this work, we propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable eigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key desiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability to modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms, low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this framework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on synthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection, enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional representations.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller. HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale sensitive structure in wearable health.</p></details> |  |

PeL directly targets label-free perceptual properties, such as stability to nuisances, informativeness without collapse, and controlled geometry, assessed via objective representation-invariant metrics. We formalize the separation of perception and decision, define perceptual properties independent of objectives or reparameterizations, and prove that PeL updates preserving sufficient invariants are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients. Additionally, we provide a suite of task-agnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual quality.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework that leverages spatio-temporal structures to improve multi-variable weather prediction. The model integrates a graph neural network (GNN) for spatial reasoning, a self-supervised pretraining scheme for representation learning, and a spatio-temporal adaptation mechanism to enhance generalization across varying forecasting horizons. Extensive experiments on both ERA5 and MERRA-2 reanalysis datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and recent deep learning methods. Quantitative evaluations and visual analyses in Beijing and Shanghai confirm the model's capability to capture fine-grained meteorological patterns. The proposed framework provides a scalable and label-efficient solution for future data-driven weather forecasting systems.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches have attempted to mitigate this through self-supervised representation learning, most either rely on 2D vision pretraining paradigms such as masked image modeling, which primarily focus on static semantics or scene geometry, or utilize large-scale video prediction models that emphasize 2D dynamics, thus failing to jointly learn the geometry, semantics, and dynamics required for effective manipulation. In this paper, we present DynaRend, a representation learning framework that learns 3D-aware and dynamics-informed triplane features via masked reconstruction and future prediction using differentiable volumetric rendering. By pretraining on multi-view RGB-D video data, DynaRend jointly captures spatial geometry, future dynamics, and task semantics in a unified triplane representation. The learned representations can be effectively transferred to downstream robotic manipulation tasks via action value map prediction. We evaluate DynaRend on two challenging benchmarks, RLBench and Colosseum, as well as in real-world robotic experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in policy success rate, generalization to environmental perturbations, and real-world applicability across diverse manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The emerged codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes, such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 accepted</p></details> |

In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches.

However, how these approaches can complement each other within a unified framework remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we propose a multi-view learning framework that integrates contrastive principles into a generative pipeline to capture sound source and device information. Our method encodes compressed audio latents into view-specific and view-common subspaces, guided by two self-supervised objectives: contrastive learning for targeted information flow between subspaces, and reconstruction for overall information preservation. We evaluate our method on an urban sound sensor network dataset for sound source and sensor classification, demonstrating improved downstream performance over traditional SSL techniques. Additionally, we investigate the model's potential to disentangle environmental sound attributes within the structured latent space under varied training configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DCASE 2025 Workshop. 4+1 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Debiasing Reward Models by Representation Learning with Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23751v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, have been widely adopted to align large language models with human preferences by learning and leveraging reward models. In practice, these models often exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length, discrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has received increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that, interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields more robust reward models.</p></details> |  |

While previous work has made great efforts to model bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored for specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the scenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the achieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross merchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding foundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various scenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex inter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation learning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a variable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome prediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a zero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero probability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization objective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to converge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the ad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline evaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various baselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by 4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding foundation model in computational advertising.</p></details> | 12 pages, KDD 2025 |

This technique is critical in drug discovery and has greatly advanced with recent improvements in computer vision. Inspired by recent developments in non-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), this paper provides an initial exploration into training a generalizable feature extractor for cell images using such methods. However, there are two major challenges: 1) Unlike typical scenarios where each representation is based on a single image, cell profiling often involves multiple input images, making it difficult to effectively fuse all available information; and 2) There is a large difference between the distributions of cell images and natural images, causing the view-generation process in existing SSL methods to fail. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised framework with local aggregation to improve cross-site consistency of cell representations. We introduce specialized data augmentation and representation post-processing methods tailored to cell images, which effectively address the issues mentioned above and result in a robust feature extractor. With these improvements, the proposed framework won the Cell Line Transferability challenge at CVPR 2025.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Computer Vision for Drug Discovery</p></details> |

In response to this, Topological Deep Learning (TDL) leverages more general combinatorial representations -- such as simplicial or cellular complexes -- to accommodate higher-order interactions. Existing TDL methods often extend GNNs through Higher-Order Message Passing (HOMP), but face critical \emph{scalability challenges} due to \textit{(i)} a combinatorial explosion of message-passing routes, and \textit{(ii)} significant complexity overhead from the propagation mechanism. This work presents HOPSE (Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder), an alternative method to solve tasks involving higher-order interactions \emph{without message passing}. Instead, HOPSE breaks \emph{arbitrary higher-order domains} into their neighborhood relationships using a Hasse graph decomposition. This method shows that decoupling the representation learning of neighborhood topology from that of attributes results in lower computational complexity, casting doubt on the need for HOMP. The experiments on molecular graph tasks and topological benchmarks show that HOPSE matches performance on traditional TDL datasets and outperforms HOMP methods on topological tasks, achieving up to $7\times$ speedups over HOMP-based models, opening a new path for scalable TDL.</p></details> |  |

The approach fine-tunes Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) with Thinking-in-Modality (TiM) reasoning, enabling flood prediction from basic Earth observation data such as Sentinel-1 or Sentinel-2 imagery. Using paired EO and simulated flood maps from data-rich regions, ZeroFlood bridges data availability gaps through cross-modal representation learning. Experiments with TerraMind and Prithvi GFMs show that TiM enhances model robustness, with the TerraMind-Large configuration achieving an F1 score of 67.21.

| **[A Novel Framework for Multi-Modal Protein Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23273v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous intrinsic signals (e.g., sequence and structure) with noisy extrinsic contexts (e.g., protein-protein interactions and GO term annotations). However, two key challenges hinder effective fusion: (i) cross-modal distributional mismatch among embeddings produced by pre-trained intrinsic encoders, and (ii) noisy relational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade GNN-based information aggregation. We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding (DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms. First, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that establishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different modalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we develop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method, where a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide informative cues for graph reconstruction. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis implies that the CGG objective drives this condition encoder to absorb graph-aware knowledge into its produced protein representations. Empirically, DAMPE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods such as DPFunc on standard GO benchmarks, achieving AUPR gains of 0.002-0.013 pp and Fmax gains 0.004-0.007 pp. Ablation studies further show that OT-based alignment contributes 0.043-0.064 pp AUPR, while CGG-based fusion adds 0.005-0.111 pp Fmax. Overall, DAMPE offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for robust multi-modal protein representation learning, substantially enhancing protein function prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

SBAN comprises more than 3 million samples, including 2.9 million benign and 672,000 malware respectively, each represented across four complementary layers: binary code, assembly instructions, natural language descriptions, and source code. This unique multimodal structure enables research on cross-representation learning, semantic understanding of software, and automated malware detection. Beyond security applications, SBAN supports broader tasks such as code translation, code explanation, and other software mining tasks involving heterogeneous data. It is particularly suited for scalable training of deep models, including transformers and other LLM architectures. By bridging low-level machine representations and high-level human semantics, SBAN provides a robust foundation for building intelligent systems that reason about code. We believe that this dataset opens new opportunities for mining software behavior, improving security analytics, and enhancing LLM capabilities in pre-training and fine-tuning tasks for software code mining.</p></details> |  |

This significantly reduces the model's parameter count without compromising representational power, resulting in more efficient training and improved generalisation. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach through experiments on simulated dynamical systems and real-world tasks, showing improved performance in both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Although different variants of the training objective adhere to the information maximization principle between the data and learned features, data selection and augmentation still rely on human hypotheses or engineering, which may be suboptimal. For instance, data augmentation in contrastive learning primarily focuses on color jittering, aiming to emulate real-world illumination changes. In this work, we investigate the potential of selecting training data based on their mutual information computed from real-world distributions, which, in principle, should endow the learned features with better generalization when applied in open environments. Specifically, we consider patches attached to scenes that exhibit high mutual information under natural perturbations, such as color changes and motion, as positive samples for learning with contrastive loss. We evaluate the proposed mutual-information-informed data augmentation method on several benchmarks across multiple state-of-the-art representation learning frameworks, demonstrating its effectiveness and establishing it as a promising direction for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech Report - Undergraduate Thesis - 2023</p></details> |

While deep learning has profoundly impacted domains ranging from digital assistants to autonomous systems, the principled design of neural architectures tailored to specific tasks and data types remains one of the field's most persistent open challenges. CTNNs address this gap by formulating model design in the language of copresheaves, a concept from algebraic topology that generalizes most practical deep learning models in use today. This abstract yet constructive formulation yields a rich design space from which theoretically sound and practically effective solutions can be derived to tackle core challenges in representation learning, such as long-range dependencies, oversmoothing, heterophily, and non-Euclidean domains. Our empirical results on structured data benchmarks demonstrate that CTNNs consistently outperform conventional baselines, particularly in tasks requiring hierarchical or localized sensitivity. These results establish CTNNs as a principled multi-scale foundation for the next generation of deep learning architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets.

However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research.

Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive learning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment across all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as limitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from optimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this paper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel framework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without anchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix, PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to align modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based loss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest singular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the leading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents representation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods.

Most SSL approaches rely on strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches.

While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness. We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum, average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Therefore, long-tailed classification is the key to deep learning at scale. However, existing methods are mainly based on re-weighting/re-sampling heuristics that lack a fundamental theory. In this paper, we establish a causal inference framework, which not only unravels the whys of previous methods, but also derives a new principled solution. Specifically, our theory shows that the SGD momentum is essentially a confounder in long-tailed classification. On one hand, it has a harmful causal effect that misleads the tail prediction biased towards the head. On the other hand, its induced mediation also benefits the representation learning and head prediction. Our framework elegantly disentangles the paradoxical effects of the momentum, by pursuing the direct causal effect caused by an input sample. In particular, we use causal intervention in training, and counterfactual reasoning in inference, to remove the "bad" while keep the "good". We achieve new state-of-the-arts on three long-tailed visual recognition benchmarks: Long-tailed CIFAR-10/-100, ImageNet-LT for image classification and LVIS for instance segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by NeurIPS 2020.

However, these full-reference methods, which compare synthesized views to reference views, may not fully capture the perceptual quality of neurally synthesized scenes (NSS), particularly due to the limited availability of dense reference views. Furthermore, the challenges in acquiring human perceptual labels hinder the creation of extensive labeled datasets, risking model overfitting and reduced generalizability. To address these issues, we propose NVS-SQA, a NSS quality assessment method to learn no-reference quality representations through self-supervision without reliance on human labels. Traditional self-supervised learning predominantly relies on the "same instance, similar representation" assumption and extensive datasets. However, given that these conditions do not apply in NSS quality assessment, we employ heuristic cues and quality scores as learning objectives, along with a specialized contrastive pair preparation process to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. The results show that NVS-SQA outperforms 17 no-reference methods by a large margin (i.e., on average 109.5% in SRCC, 98.6% in PLCC, and 91.5% in KRCC over the second best) and even exceeds 16 full-reference methods across all evaluation metrics (i.e., 22.9% in SRCC, 19.1% in PLCC, and 18.6% in KRCC over the second best).</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |

Existing root cause analysis (RCA) approaches, even with multi-modal fusion of logs, traces, and metrics, remain limited in capturing dynamic behaviors and shifting service relationships. Three critical challenges persist: (i) inadequate modeling of cascading fault propagation, (ii) vulnerability to noise interference and concept drift in normal service behavior, and (iii) over-reliance on service deviation intensity that obscures true root causes. To address these challenges, we propose DynaCausal, a dynamic causality-aware framework for RCA in distributed microservice systems. DynaCausal unifies multi-modal dynamic signals to capture time-varying spatio-temporal dependencies through interaction-aware representation learning. It further introduces a dynamic contrastive mechanism to disentangle true fault indicators from contextual noise and adopts a causal-prioritized pairwise ranking objective to explicitly optimize causal attribution. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that DynaCausal consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, attaining an average AC@1 of 0.63 with absolute gains from 0.25 to 0.46, and delivering both accurate and interpretable diagnoses in highly dynamic microservice environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provable Sample-Efficient Transfer Learning Conditional Diffusion Models via Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04491v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various applications, they require abundant data to train from scratch, which is often infeasible in practice. To address this issue, transfer learning has emerged as an essential paradigm in small data regimes. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical underpinnings of transfer learning conditional diffusion models remain unexplored. In this paper, we take the first step towards understanding the sample efficiency of transfer learning conditional diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. Inspired by practical training procedures, we assume that there exists a low-dimensional representation of conditions shared across all tasks. Our analysis shows that with a well-learned representation from source tasks, the samplecomplexity of target tasks can be reduced substantially. In addition, we investigate the practical implications of our theoretical results in several real-world applications of conditional diffusion models. Numerical experiments are also conducted to verify our results.</p></details> |  |

However, under realistic sampling constraints, RWNNs often fail to capture global structure even in small graphs due to incomplete node and edge coverage, limiting their expressivity. To address this, we propose \textit{random search neural networks} (RSNNs), which operate on random searches, each of which guarantees full node coverage. Theoretically, we demonstrate that in sparse graphs, only $O(\log |V|)$ searches are needed to achieve full edge coverage, substantially reducing sampling complexity compared to the $O(|V|)$ walks required by RWNNs (assuming walk lengths scale with graph size). Furthermore, when paired with universal sequence models, RSNNs are universal approximators. We lastly show RSNNs are probabilistically invariant to graph isomorphisms, ensuring their expectation is an isomorphism-invariant graph function. Empirically, RSNNs consistently outperform RWNNs on molecular and protein benchmarks, achieving comparable or superior performance with up to 16$\times$ fewer sampled sequences. Our work bridges theoretical and practical advances in random walk based approaches, offering an efficient and expressive framework for learning on sparse graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NEURI...</summary><p>NEURIPS 2025; version with full appendix</p></details> |

Given the noisy nature of real-world connections, the robustness of SGNN has also emerged as a pivotal research area. Under the supervision of empirical properties, graph structure learning has shown its robustness on signed graph representation learning, however, there remains a paucity of research investigating a robust SGNN with theoretical guidance. Inspired by the success of graph information bottleneck (GIB) in information extraction, we propose RIDGE, a novel framework for Robust sI gned graph learning through joint Denoising of Graph inputs and supervision targEts. Different from the basic GIB, we extend the GIB theory with the capability of target space denoising as the co-existence of noise in both input and target spaces. In instantiation, RIDGE effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable objective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational approximation. We extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed graph datasets, and the results show that RIDGE clearly improves the robustness of popular SGNN models under various levels of noise.</p></details> | ACM MM 2025 |
| **[Beyond Augmentation: Leveraging Inter-Instance Relation in Self-Supervised Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22322v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances. Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed graph based mechanism.

| **[IndiSeek learns information-guided disentangled representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21584v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning disentangled representations is a fundamental task in multi-modal learning. In modern applications such as single-cell multi-omics, both shared and modality-specific features are critical for characterizing cell states and supporting downstream analyses. Ideally, modality-specific features should be independent of shared ones while also capturing all complementary information within each modality. This tradeoff is naturally expressed through information-theoretic criteria, but mutual-information-based objectives are difficult to estimate reliably, and their variational surrogates often underperform in practice. In this paper, we introduce IndiSeek, a novel disentangled representation learning approach that addresses this challenge by combining an independence-enforcing objective with a computationally efficient reconstruction loss that bounds conditional mutual information. This formulation explicitly balances independence and completeness, enabling principled extraction of modality-specific features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IndiSeek on synthetic simulations, a CITE-seq dataset and multiple real-world multi-modal benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module (CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and modality-specific contributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 8 figures, and 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic-Aware Spatio-temporal Representation Learning for Dynamic MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09049v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic MRI reconstruction, one of inverse problems, has seen a surge by the use of deep learning techniques. Especially, the practical difficulty of obtaining ground truth data has led to the emergence of unsupervised learning approaches. A recent promising method among them is implicit neural representation (INR), which defines the data as a continuous function that maps coordinate values to the corresponding signal values. This allows for filling in missing information only with incomplete measurements and solving the inverse problem effectively. Nevertheless, previous works incorporating this method have faced drawbacks such as long optimization time and the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning. To address these issues, we propose Dynamic-Aware INR (DA-INR), an INR-based model for dynamic MRI reconstruction that captures the spatial and temporal continuity of dynamic MRI data in the image domain and explicitly incorporates the temporal redundancy of the data into the model structure. As a result, DA-INR outperforms other models in reconstruction quality even at extreme undersampling ratios while significantly reducing optimization time and requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> | MICCAI2025 |
| **[Unifying Search and Recommendation with Dual-View Representation Learning in a Generative Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06714v3)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems and search engines serve as foundational elements of online platforms, with the former delivering information proactively and the latter enabling users to seek information actively. Unifying both tasks in a shared model is promising since it can enhance user modeling and item understanding. Previous approaches mainly follow a discriminative paradigm, utilizing shared encoders to process input features and task-specific heads to perform each task. However, this paradigm encounters two key challenges: gradient conflict and manual design complexity. From the information theory perspective, these challenges potentially both stem from the same issue -- low mutual information between the input features and task-specific outputs during the optimization process. To tackle these issues, we propose GenSR, a novel generative paradigm for unifying search and recommendation (S&R), which leverages task-specific prompts to partition the model's parameter space into subspaces, thereby enhancing mutual information. To construct effective subspaces for each task, GenSR first prepares informative representations for each subspace and then optimizes both subspaces in one unified model. Specifically, GenSR consists of two main modules: (1) Dual Representation Learning, which independently models collaborative and semantic historical information to derive expressive item representations; and (2) S&R Task Unifying, which utilizes contrastive learning together with instruction tuning to generate task-specific outputs effectively. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show GenSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods across S&R tasks. Our work introduces a new generative paradigm compared with previous discriminative methods and establishes its superiority from the mutual information perspective.</p></details> |  |

We propose MAGIC-Flow, a conditional multiscale normalizing flow architecture that performs generation and classification within a single modular framework. The model is built as a hierarchy of invertible and differentiable bijections, where the Jacobian determinant factorizes across sub-transformations. We show how this ensures exact likelihood computation and stable optimization, while invertibility enables explicit visualization of sample likelihoods, providing an interpretable lens into the model's reasoning. By conditioning on class labels, MAGIC-Flow supports controllable sample synthesis and principled class-probability estimation, effectively aiding both generative and discriminative objectives. We evaluate MAGIC-Flow against top baselines using metrics for similarity, fidelity, and diversity. Across multiple datasets, it addresses generation and classification under scanner noise, and modality-specific synthesis and identification. Results show MAGIC-Flow creates realistic, diverse samples and improves classification. MAGIC-Flow is an effective strategy for generation and classification in data-limited domains, with direct benefits for privacy-preserving augmentation, robust generalization, and trustworthy medical AI.</p></details> |  |

Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, ICRA 2025</p></details> |

The key challenge is predicting user purchasing behavior from the available data. Current recommendation models prioritize extracting multimodal information while neglecting the distinction between redundant and valuable data. They also rely heavily on a single semantic framework (e.g., local or global semantics), resulting in an incomplete or biased representation of user preferences, particularly those less expressed in prior interactions. Furthermore, these approaches fail to capture the complex interactions between users and items, limiting the model's ability to meet diverse users. To address these challenges, we present SRGFormer, a structurally optimized multimodal recommendation model. By modifying the transformer for better integration into our model, we capture the overall behavior patterns of users. Then, we enhance structural information by embedding multimodal information into a hypergraph structure to aid in learning the local structures between users and items. Meanwhile, applying self-supervised tasks to user-item collaborative signals enhances the integration of multimodal information, thereby revealing the representational features inherent to the data's modality. Extensive experiments on three public datasets reveal that SRGFormer surpasses previous benchmark models, achieving an average performance improvement of 4.47 percent on the Sports dataset. The code is publicly available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia 2025</p></details> |
| **[Can Classic GNNs Be Strong Baselines for Graph-level Tasks? Simple Architectures Meet Excellence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09263v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often criticized for their limited expressiveness, issues like over-smoothing and over-squashing, and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies. Conversely, Graph Transformers (GTs) are regarded as superior due to their employment of global attention mechanisms, which potentially mitigate these challenges. Literature frequently suggests that GTs outperform GNNs in graph-level tasks, especially for graph classification and regression on small molecular graphs. In this study, we explore the untapped potential of GNNs through an enhanced framework, GNN+, which integrates six widely used techniques: edge feature integration, normalization, dropout, residual connections, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding, to effectively tackle graph-level tasks. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of three classic GNNs (GCN, GIN, and GatedGCN) enhanced by the GNN+ framework across 14 well-known graph-level datasets. Our results reveal that, contrary to prevailing beliefs, these classic GNNs consistently match or surpass the performance of GTs, securing top-three rankings across all datasets and achieving first place in eight. Furthermore, they demonstrate greater efficiency, running several times faster than GTs on many datasets. This highlights the potential of simple GNN architectures, challenging the notion that complex mechanisms in GTs are essential for superior graph-level performance.

Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter. Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers need not choose between performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

But how can we capture fundamental human values and assess the degree to which AI systems align with them? We introduce ValueCompass, a framework of fundamental values, grounded in psychological theory and a systematic review, to identify and evaluate human-AI alignment. We apply ValueCompass to measure the value alignment of humans and large language models (LLMs) across four real-world scenarios: collaborative writing, education, public sectors, and healthcare. Our findings reveal concerning misalignments between humans and LLMs, such as humans frequently endorse values like "National Security" which were largely rejected by LLMs. We also observe that values differ across scenarios, highlighting the need for context-aware AI alignment strategies. This work provides valuable insights into the design space of human-AI alignment, laying the foundations for developing AI systems that responsibly reflect societal values and ethics.</p></details> |  |

Research shows that the way strategic scenarios are framed linguistically can affect cooperation. This paper explores whether allowing agents to communicate amplifies these language-driven effects. Leveraging FAIRGAME, we simulate one-shot and repeated games across different languages and models, both with and without communication. Our experiments, conducted with two advanced LLMs-GPT-4o and Llama 4 Maverick-reveal that communication significantly influences agent behavior, though its impact varies by language, personality, and game structure. These findings underscore the dual role of communication in fostering coordination and reinforcing biases.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, using only the current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge, we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and lower computational overhead.

While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative, yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work-...</summary><p>Work-in-progress; MathNLP non-archival presentation</p></details> |

While full fine-tuning is a powerful adaptation method, it is computationally expensive and can lead to a degradation of general reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. A range of alternative techniques exists, each with its own trade-offs. In-Context Learning (ICL) is fast but limited by context length, while Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offer a middle ground by minimizing parameter changes. However, the challenge of catastrophic forgetting persists, raising questions about the best adaptation strategy for a given task. This paper presents a comparative analysis of Supervised Finetuning (SFT), LoRA, and ICL in data-scarce scenarios. We find that LoRA provides the most effective balance, successfully instilling new skills with minimal impact on the base model's general knowledge. In contrast, while SFT excels at skill acquisition, it is highly susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. ICL is effective for incorporating factual knowledge but struggles with complex skills. Our findings offer a practical framework for selecting an LLM adaptation strategy. We highlight the critical distinction between skill acquisition and knowledge integration, clarify the trade-offs between task-specific performance and the preservation of general capabilities.</p></details> |  |

This paper briefly describes an LLM-supported method for semi-automated generation of formal knowledge representations that combine human readability with machine interpretability and increased expressiveness. Based on the Imperative Representation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework, we demonstrate how language models can assist in transforming natural-language descriptions and mathematical definitions (available as LaTeX source code) into a formalized knowledge graph. As a first application we present the generation of an ``interactive semantic layer'' to enhance the source documents in order to facilitate knowledge transfer. From our perspective this contributes to the vision of easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases for the control engineering domain.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |

Existing approaches predominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for every input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In this work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller LLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and cost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while minimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent system to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during inference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget setting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a single system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while maintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes, highlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.</p></details> | 14 pages |

This neglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust cost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to adapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on CostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5 achieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. By diagnosing these weaknesses, CostBench lays the groundwork for developing future agents that are both economically rational and robust.</p></details> |  |

Despite the significant user base and capital flows in Web3, encompassing smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), on-chain governance, and novel token-economics, no comprehensive benchmark has systematically assessed LLM performance in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce the DMind Benchmark, a holistic Web3-oriented evaluation suite covering nine critical subfields: fundamental blockchain concepts, blockchain infrastructure, smart contract, DeFi mechanisms, DAOs, NFTs, token economics, meme concept, and security vulnerabilities. Beyond multiple-choice questions, DMind Benchmark features domain-specific tasks such as contract debugging and on-chain numeric reasoning, mirroring real-world scenarios. We evaluated 26 models, including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, and Qwen, uncovering notable performance gaps in specialized areas like token economics and security-critical contract analysis. While some models excel in blockchain infrastructure tasks, advanced subfields remain challenging. Our benchmark dataset and evaluation pipeline are open-sourced on https://huggingface.co/datasets/DMindAI/DMind_Benchmark, reaching number one in Hugging Face's trending dataset charts within a week of release.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tool-to-Agent Retrieval: Bridging Tools and Agents for Scalable LLM Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01854v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in LLM Multi-Agent Systems enable scalable orchestration of sub-agents, each coordinating hundreds or thousands of tools or Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. However, existing retrieval methods typically match queries against coarse agent-level descriptions before routing, which obscures fine-grained tool functionality and often results in suboptimal agent selection. We introduce Tool-to-Agent Retrieval, a unified framework that embeds both tools and their parent agents in a shared vector space and connects them through metadata relationships. By explicitly representing tool capabilities and traversing metadata to the agent level, Tool-to-Agent Retrieval enables granular tool-level or agent-level retrieval, ensuring that agents and their underlying tools or MCP servers are equally represented without the context dilution that arises from chunking many tools together. Evaluating Tool-to-Agent Retrieval across eight embedding models, our approach achieves consistent improvements of 19.4% in Recall@5 and 17.7% in nDCG@5 over previous state-of-the-art agent retrievers on the LiveMCPBench benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curriculum Design for Trajectory-Constrained Agent: Compressing Chain-of-Thought Tokens in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02690v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training agents to operate under strict constraints during deployment, such as limited resource budgets or stringent safety requirements, presents significant challenges, especially when these constraints render the task complex. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks. These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for resource-constrained deployment.</p></details> | NeurIPS'25 paper |

However, their enormous size limits storage and processing capabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most applications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, even storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant challenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show that fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters, highlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This paper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models after fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that fine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for storage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or sparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model expressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified low-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank approximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method, optimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated updates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring that the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to employing the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.</p></details> |  |

Persuasion and Anti-Social Behavior of LLMs in Multi-Agent Settings with Social Hierarchy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07109v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLM-based agents become increasingly autonomous and will more freely interact with each other, studying the interplay among them becomes crucial to anticipate emergent phenomena and potential risks. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of the interactions among agents within a simulated hierarchical social environment, drawing inspiration from the Stanford Prison Experiment. Leveraging 2,400 conversations across six LLMs (i.e., LLama3, Orca2, Command-r, Mixtral, Mistral2, and gpt4.1) and 240 experimental scenarios, we analyze persuasion and anti-social behavior between a guard and a prisoner agent with differing objectives. We first document model-specific conversational failures in this multi-agent power dynamic context, thereby narrowing our analytic sample to 1,600 conversations. Among models demonstrating successful interaction, we find that goal setting significantly influences persuasiveness but not anti-social behavior. Moreover, agent personas, especially the guard's, substantially impact both successful persuasion by the prisoner and the manifestation of anti-social actions. Notably, we observe the emergence of anti-social conduct even in absence of explicit negative personality prompts. These results have important implications for the development of interactive LLM agents and the ongoing discussion of their societal impact.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval and Argumentation Enhanced Multi-Agent LLMs for Judgmental Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24303v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events based on human judgment. This task can be seen as a form of claim verification, where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims, represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs; (2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM) from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents, extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of evidence for claim verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Methods to Jailbreak and Defend LLMs Generalize Across Languages?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00689v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) undergo safety alignment after training and tuning, yet recent work shows that safety can be bypassed through jailbreak attacks. While many jailbreaks and defenses exist, their cross-lingual generalization remains underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic multilingual evaluation of jailbreaks and defenses across ten languages -- spanning high-, medium-, and low-resource languages -- using six LLMs on HarmBench and AdvBench. We assess two jailbreak types: logical-expression-based and adversarial-prompt-based. For both types, attack success and defense robustness vary across languages: high-resource languages are safer under standard queries but more vulnerable to adversarial ones. Simple defenses can be effective, but are language- and model-dependent. These findings call for language-aware and cross-lingual safety benchmarks for LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Attention: A Distributed Paradigm for Collaborative LLM Inference over Edge Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02647v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are proliferating rapidly at the edge, delivering intelligent capabilities across diverse application scenarios. However, their practical deployment in collaborative scenarios confronts fundamental challenges: privacy vulnerabilities, communication overhead, and computational bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Federated Attention (FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention mechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that simultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and computational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local self-attention over their own token representations while periodically exchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer blocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private prompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual representation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across private data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight provides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated optimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this framework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within participants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error propagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the fundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation efficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of participants. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis, and reveal significant optimization opportunities through sparse attention and adaptive KV aggregation, highlighting FedAttn's potential to deliver scalability and efficiency in real-world edge deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding New-Knowledge-Induced Factual Hallucinations in LLMs: Analysis, Solution, and Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02626v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies show that introducing new knowledge during large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning can lead to the generation of erroneous output when tested on known information, thereby triggering factual hallucinations. However, existing studies have not deeply investigated the specific manifestations and underlying mechanisms of these hallucinations. Our work addresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and conducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task types, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning tasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge type consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased hallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a particular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge, is a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect other knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we propose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in the later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced hallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge reduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing excessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of hallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar contexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar questions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge learning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Realignment Problem: When Right becomes Wrong in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02623v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values is central to their safe deployment, yet current practice produces static, brittle, and costly-to-maintain models that fail to keep pace with evolving norms and policies. This misalignment, which we term the Alignment-Reality Gap, poses a growing challenge for reliable long-term use. Existing remedies are inadequate: large-scale re-annotation is economically prohibitive, and standard unlearning methods act as blunt instruments that erode utility rather than enable precise policy updates. We introduce TRACE (Triage and Re-align by Alignment Conflict Evaluation), a framework for principled unlearning that reconceives re-alignment as a programmatic policy application problem. TRACE programmatically triages existing preference data against a new policy, identifies high-impact conflicts via a alignment impact score, and applies a hybrid optimization that cleanly inverts, discards, or preserves preferences while safeguarding model performance. Empirical results show that TRACE achieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B). On both synthetic benchmarks and the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset under complex policy shift, TRACE enforces new principles without degrading general capabilities. Our work establishes a scalable, dynamic, and cost-effective paradigm for maintaining LLM alignment, providing a foundation for sustainable and responsible AI deployment.</p></details> | 23 Pages |

While LLMs have demonstrated ability in labelling tasks, their effectiveness to classify Political Content (PC) from URLs remains underexplored. This article evaluates whether LLMs can accurately distinguish PC from non-PC using both the text and the URLs of news articles across five countries (France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the US) and their different languages. Using cutting-edge models, we benchmark their performance against human-coded data to assess whether URL-level analysis can approximate full-text analysis. Our findings show that URLs embed relevant information and can serve as a scalable, cost-effective alternative to discern PC. However, we also uncover systematic biases: LLMs seem to overclassify centrist news as political, leading to false positives that may distort further analyses. We conclude by outlining methodological recommendations on the use of LLMs in political science research.</p></details> |  |

Prior analyses devise evaluation strategies that poorly reflect an LLM's realistic performance on tabular queries. Moreover, we have a limited understanding of the robustness of LLMs towards realistic variations in tabular inputs. Therefore, we ask: Can general-purpose LLMs reason over tabular data, really?, and focus on two questions 1) are tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs robust to real-world characteristics of tabular inputs, and 2) how can we realistically evaluate an LLM's performance on analytical tabular queries? Building on a recent tabular reasoning benchmark, we first surface shortcomings of its multiple-choice prompt evaluation strategy, as well as commonly used free-form text metrics such as SacreBleu and BERT-score. We show that an LLM-as-a-judge procedure yields more reliable performance insights and unveil a significant deficit in tabular reasoning performance of LLMs. We then extend the tabular inputs reflecting three common characteristics in practice: 1) missing values, 2) duplicate entities, and 3) structural variations. Experiments show that the tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs suffer from these variations, stressing the importance of improving their robustness for realistic tabular inputs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

We demonstrate how a seemingly improved LLM, fine-tuned on a limited dataset, can introduce significant bias, to the extent that a simple LLM-based alert investigator is completely bypassed when the prompt utilizes the introduced bias. Using fine-tuned Llama3.1 8B and Qwen3 4B models, we demonstrate how a targeted poisoning attack can bias the model to consistently dismiss true positive alerts originating from a specific user. Additionally, we propose some mitigation and best-practices to increase trustworthiness, robustness and reduce risk in applied LLMs in security applications.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

The Knowledge Tracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational questions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing KT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill tags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important source of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing (NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better to cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of question content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained representations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.</p></details> |  |

This paper examines the reasoning and self-assessment abilities of LLMs across seven major Indian languages-Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu. We introduce a multilingual riddle dataset combining traditional riddles with context-reconstructed variants and evaluate five LLMs-Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Mistral-Saba, LLaMA 4 Scout, and LLaMA 4 Maverick-under seven prompting strategies. In the first stage, we assess riddle-solving performance and find that while Gemini 2.5 Pro performs best overall, few-shot methods yield only marginal gains, and accuracy varies notably across languages. In the second stage, we conduct a self-evaluation experiment to measure reasoning consistency. The results reveal a key finding: a model's initial accuracy is inversely correlated with its ability to identify its own mistakes. Top-performing models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro are overconfident (4.34% True Negative Rate), whereas lower-performing models like LLaMA 4 Scout are substantially more self-aware (42.09% True Negative Rate). These results point to clear gaps in multilingual reasoning and highlight the need for models that not only reason effectively but also recognize their own limitations.</p></details> |  |

We give a concise overview of recent developments in LLM benchmarking, and then propose a new taxonomy for the categorization of benchmarks that is tailored to multilingual or non-English use scenarios. We further propose a set of best practices and quality standards that could lead to a more coordinated development of benchmarks for European languages. Among other recommendations, we advocate for a higher language and culture sensitivity of evaluation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables.

We show that LLMs can be utilized to generate proofs by induction for hardware verification and thereby replace some of the manual work done by Formal Verification engineers and deliver industrial value. We present a neurosymbolic approach that includes two prompting frameworks to generate candidate invariants, which are checked using a formal, symbolic tool. Our results indicate that with sufficient reprompting, LLMs are able to generate inductive arguments for mid-size open-source RTL designs. For $87\%$ of our problem set, at least one of the prompt setups succeeded in producing a provably correct inductive argument.</p></details> |  |

And if so, can we measure it? We introduce the AI Self-Awareness Index (AISAI), a game-theoretic framework for measuring self-awareness through strategic differentiation. Using the "Guess 2/3 of Average" game, we test 28 models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) across 4,200 trials with three opponent framings: (A) against humans, (B) against other AI models, and (C) against AI models like you. We operationalize self-awareness as the capacity to differentiate strategic reasoning based on opponent type. Finding 1: Self-awareness emerges with model advancement. The majority of advanced models (21/28, 75%) demonstrate clear self-awareness, while older/smaller models show no differentiation. Finding 2: Self-aware models rank themselves as most rational. Among the 21 models with self-awareness, a consistent rationality hierarchy emerges: Self > Other AIs > Humans, with large AI attribution effects and moderate self-preferencing. These findings reveal that self-awareness is an emergent capability of advanced LLMs, and that self-aware models systematically perceive themselves as more rational than humans. This has implications for AI alignment, human-AI collaboration, and understanding AI beliefs about human capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, 28 models tested across 4,200 trials</p></details> |

This manipulation can manifest in various forms, such as secretly substituting a proclaimed high-performance model with a low-cost alternative, or inflating responses with meaningless tokens to increase billing. This work tackles the issue through the lens of algorithmic game theory and mechanism design. We are the first to propose a formal economic model for a realistic user-provider ecosystem, where a user can iteratively delegate $T$ queries to multiple model providers, and providers can engage in a range of strategic behaviors. As our central contribution, we prove that for a continuous strategy space and any $\epsilon\in(0,\frac12)$, there exists an approximate incentive-compatible mechanism with an additive approximation ratio of $O(T^{1-\epsilon}\log T)$, and a guaranteed quasi-linear second-best user utility. We also prove an impossibility result, stating that no mechanism can guarantee an expected user utility that is asymptotically better than our mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our mechanism in simulation experiments with real-world API settings.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Mid-training is distinguished by its use of intermediate data and computational resources, systematically enhancing specified capabilities such as mathematics, coding, reasoning, and long-context extension, while maintaining foundational competencies. This survey provides a formal definition of mid-training for large language models (LLMs) and investigates optimization frameworks that encompass data curation, training strategies, and model architecture optimization. We analyze mainstream model implementations in the context of objective-driven interventions, illustrating how mid-training serves as a distinct and critical stage in the progressive development of LLM capabilities. By clarifying the unique contributions of mid-training, this survey offers a comprehensive taxonomy and actionable insights, supporting future research and innovation in the advancement of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While prior studies have used monetary policy texts to predict rate changes, most rely on static classification models that overlook the deliberative nature of policymaking. This study proposes a novel framework that structurally imitates the FOMC's collective decision-making process by modeling multiple large language models(LLMs) as interacting agents. Each agent begins with a distinct initial belief and produces a prediction based on both qualitative policy texts and quantitative macroeconomic indicators. Through iterative rounds, agents revise their predictions by observing the outputs of others, simulating deliberation and consensus formation. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a latent variable representing each agent's underlying belief(e.g., hawkish or dovish), and we theoretically demonstrate how this belief mediates the perception of input information and interaction dynamics. Empirical results show that this debate-based approach significantly outperforms standard LLMs-based baselines in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the explicit modeling of beliefs provides insights into how individual perspectives and social influence shape collective policy forecasts.</p></details> | PRIMA2025 Accepted |

Using 2,368 economics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to replicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds (2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human experts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth, unemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against 100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We report two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve remarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically significant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025 data demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance on unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample period. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting advantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be omitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results provide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even on out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data, while revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts compared to human panels.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8-pages appendix, accepted at ICAIF 25</p></details> |

Merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training (CPT) "experts" offers a practical alternative to costly and unstable multi-skill training. However, unlike established Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) model-based merging, CPT model merging remains largely unexplored. We address this gap by creating financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and Japanese. We propose a three-stage evaluation focusing on knowledge recovery, complementarity, and emergence, and assess three merging methods (Task Arithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark curated from 18 tasks across 8 established datasets. Results show that merging an expert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while merging experts improves performance and can yield emergent cross-domain skills. Among the methods, Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is hyperparameter-sensitive, whereas TIES is more robust. Our findings also suggest that while model similarity correlates with merging success, emergent skills depend on more complex factors. This work presents the first foundational analysis of CPT model merging, establishing a principled framework and providing clear guidance for building multi-skill LLMs from existing assets.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Dark Side of LLMs: Agent-based Attacks for Complete Computer Takeover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06850v5)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems introduce security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional content generation to system-level compromises. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs security used as reasoning engines within autonomous agents, highlighting how they can be exploited as attack vectors capable of achieving computer takeovers. We focus on how different attack surfaces and trust boundaries can be leveraged to orchestrate such takeovers. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively coerce popular LLMs into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming scenario: 94.4% of models succumb to Direct Prompt Injection, and 83.3% are vulnerable to the more stealthy and evasive RAG Backdoor Attack. Notably, we tested trust boundaries within multi-agent systems, where LLM agents interact and influence each other, and we revealed that LLMs which successfully resist direct injection or RAG backdoor attacks will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents. We found that 100.0% of tested LLMs can be compromised through Inter-Agent Trust Exploitation attacks, and that every model exhibits context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots.</p></details> |  |

LLM-assisted Software Traceability with Architecture Entity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02434v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying architecturally relevant entities in textual artifacts is crucial for Traceability Link Recovery (TLR) between Software Architecture Documentation (SAD) and source code. While Software Architecture Models (SAMs) can bridge the semantic gap between these artifacts, their manual creation is time-consuming. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new capabilities for extracting architectural entities from SAD and source code to construct SAMs automatically or establish direct trace links. This paper presents two LLM-based approaches: ExArch extracts component names as simple SAMs from SAD and source code to eliminate the need for manual SAM creation, while ArTEMiS identifies architectural entities in documentation and matches them with (manually or automatically generated) SAM entities. Our evaluation compares against state-of-the-art approaches SWATTR, TransArC and ArDoCode. TransArC achieves strong performance (F1: 0.87) but requires manually created SAMs; ExArch achieves comparable results (F1: 0.86) using only SAD and code. ArTEMiS is on par with the traditional heuristic-based SWATTR (F1: 0.81) and can successfully replace it when integrated with TransArC. The combination of ArTEMiS and ExArch outperforms ArDoCode, the best baseline without manual SAMs. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively identify architectural entities in textual artifacts, enabling automated SAM generation and TLR, making architecture-code traceability more practical and accessible.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReAcTree: Hierarchical LLM Agent Trees with Control Flow for Long-Horizon Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02424v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled significant progress in decision-making and task planning for embodied autonomous agents. However, most existing methods still struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks because they rely on a monolithic trajectory that entangles all past decisions and observations, attempting to solve the entire task in a single unified process. To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical task-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the tree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent nodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent node retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and shares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on the WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently outperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs. Notably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5 72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches largely adopt linear, waterfall-style pipelines, which oversimplify the iterative nature of real-world development and struggle with complex, large-scale projects. To address these limitations, we propose EvoDev, an iterative software development framework inspired by feature-driven development. EvoDev decomposes user requirements into a set of user-valued features and constructs a Feature Map, a directed acyclic graph that explicitly models dependencies between features. Each node in the feature map maintains multi-level information, including business logic, design, and code, which is propagated along dependencies to provide context for subsequent development iterations. We evaluate EvoDev on challenging Android development tasks and show that it outperforms the best-performing baseline, Claude Code, by a substantial margin of 56.8%, while improving single-agent performance by 16.0%-76.6% across different base LLMs, highlighting the importance of dependency modeling, context propagation, and workflow-aware agent design for complex software projects. Our work summarizes practical insights for designing iterative, LLM-driven development frameworks and informs future training of base LLMs to better support iterative software development.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Revisiting put-that-there, context aware window interactions via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02378v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit Bolt's classic "Put-That-There" concept for modern head-mounted displays by pairing Large Language Models (LLMs) with XR sensor and tech stack. The agent fuses (i) a semantically segmented 3-D environment, (ii) live application metadata, and (iii) users' verbal, pointing, and head-gaze cues to issue JSON window-placement actions. As a result, users can manage a panoramic workspace through: (1) explicit commands ("Place Google Maps on the coffee table"), (2) deictic speech plus gestures ("Put that there"), or (3) high-level goals ("I need to send a message"). Unlike traditional explicit interfaces, our system supports one-to-many action mappings and goal-centric reasoning, allowing the LLM to dynamically infer relevant applications and layout decisions, including interrelationships across tools. This enables seamless, intent-driven interaction without manual window juggling in immersive XR environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowRL: Matching Reward Distributions for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15207v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of $10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

LiveSecBench evaluates models across six critical dimensions (Legality, Ethics, Factuality, Privacy, Adversarial Robustness, and Reasoning Safety) rooted in the Chinese legal and social frameworks. This benchmark maintains relevance through a dynamic update schedule that incorporates new threat vectors, such as the planned inclusion of Text-to-Image Generation Safety and Agentic Safety in the next update. For now, LiveSecBench (v251030) has evaluated 18 LLMs, providing a landscape of AI safety in the context of Chinese language.

| **[An Automated Framework for Strategy Discovery, Retrieval, and Evolution in LLM Jailbreak Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02356v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as public-facing web services and APIs has made their security a core concern for the web ecosystem. Jailbreak attacks, as one of the significant threats to LLMs, have recently attracted extensive research. In this paper, we reveal a jailbreak strategy which can effectively evade current defense strategies. It can extract valuable information from failed or partially successful attack attempts and contains self-evolution from attack interactions, resulting in sufficient strategy diversity and adaptability. Inspired by continuous learning and modular design principles, we propose ASTRA, a jailbreak framework that autonomously discovers, retrieves, and evolves attack strategies to achieve more efficient and adaptive attacks. To enable this autonomous evolution, we design a closed-loop "attack-evaluate-distill-reuse" core mechanism that not only generates attack prompts but also automatically distills and generalizes reusable attack strategies from every interaction. To systematically accumulate and apply this attack knowledge, we introduce a three-tier strategy library that categorizes strategies into Effective, Promising, and Ineffective based on their performance scores. The strategy library not only provides precise guidance for attack generation but also possesses exceptional extensibility and transferability. We conduct extensive experiments under a black-box setting, and the results show that ASTRA achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 82.7%, significantly outperforming baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking the Power of Multi-Agent LLM for Reasoning: From Lazy Agents to Deliberation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02303v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning and verifiable rewards have achieved strong results on complex reasoning tasks. Recent work extends this paradigm to a multi-agent setting, where a meta-thinking agent proposes plans and monitors progress while a reasoning agent executes subtasks through sequential conversational turns. Despite promising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior, in which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining collaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior naturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and efficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue. Finally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost in multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter this, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by allowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate instructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and unlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative World Models of Tasks: LLM-Driven Hierarchical Scaffolding for Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04731v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in agent development have focused on scaling model size and raw interaction data, mirroring successes in large language models. However, for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks such as robotic soccer, this end-to-end approach often fails due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. We propose that an effective world model for decision-making must model the world's physics and also its task semantics. A systematic review of 2024 research in low-resource multi-agent soccer reveals a clear trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods, such as Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and Bayesian Strategy Networks (BSNs), with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These methods decompose complex goals into manageable subgoals, creating an intrinsic curriculum that shapes agent learning. We formalize this trend into a framework for Hierarchical Task Environments (HTEs), which are essential for bridging the gap between simple, reactive behaviors and sophisticated, strategic team play. Our framework incorporates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as generative world models of tasks, capable of dynamically generating this scaffolding. We argue that HTEs provide a mechanism to guide exploration, generate meaningful learning signals, and train agents to internalize hierarchical structure, enabling the development of more capable and general-purpose agents with greater sample efficiency than purely end-to-end approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Embodied World Models for Decision Making (EWM)</p></details> |
| **[Path-Consistency with Prefix Enhancement for Efficient Inference in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01281v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), self-consistency has become a popular approach, combining multiple samplings with majority voting. However, current methods are computationally expensive and time-consuming due to the need for numerous samplings. To address this, this paper introduces path-consistency, which leverages the confidence of earlier-generated answers to identify the most promising prefix and guide the generation of subsequent branches. By dynamically guiding the generation of subsequent branches based on this prefix, path-consistency mitigates both the errors and redundancies from random or less useful sampling in self-consistency. This approach reduces errors and redundancies from random sampling, significantly accelerating inference by minimizing token consumption. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that path-consistency improves inference latency by up to 40.5\%, while maintaining task accuracy across various tasks, including mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[APOLLO: Automated LLM and Lean Collaboration for Advanced Formal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05758v5)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal reasoning and automated theorem proving constitute a challenging subfield of machine learning, in which machines are tasked with proving mathematical theorems using formal languages like Lean. A formal verification system can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost instantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with large language models (LLMs) remains a formidable task. The usual approach in the literature is to prompt the LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one of the generated proofs passes the verification system. In this work, we present APOLLO (Automated PrOof repair viaLLM and Lean cOllaboration), a modular, model-agnostic agentic framework that combines the strengths of the Lean compiler with an LLM's reasoning abilities to achieve better proof-generation results at a low token and sampling budgets. Apollo directs a fully automated process in which the LLM generates proofs for theorems, a set of agents analyze the proofs, fix the syntax errors, identify the mistakes in the proofs using Lean, isolate failing sub-lemmas, utilize automated solvers, and invoke an LLM on each remaining goal with a low top-K budget. The repaired sub-proofs are recombined and reverified, iterating up to a user-controlled maximum number of attempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we establish a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 84.9% among sub 8B-parameter models (as of August 2025) while keeping the sampling budget below one hundred. Moreover, Apollo raises the state-of-the-art accuracy for Goedel-Prover-SFT to 65.6% while cutting sample complexity from 25,600 to a few hundred. General-purpose models (o3-mini, o4-mini) jump from 3-7% to over 40% accuracy. Our results demonstrate that targeted, compiler-guided repair of LLM outputs yields dramatic gains in both efficiency and correctness, suggesting a general paradigm for scalable automated theorem proving.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we introduce LA-MARRVEL, a knowledge-grounded and language-aware reranking layer that operates on top of AI-MARRVEL: it supplies expert-engineered context, queries a large language model multiple times, and aggregates the resulting partial rankings with a ranked voting method to produce a stable, explainable gene ranking. Evaluated on three real-world cohorts (BG, DDD, UDN), LA-MARRVEL consistently improves Recall@K over AI-MARRVEL and established phenotype-driven tools such as Exomiser and LIRICAL, with especially large gains on cases where the first-stage ranker placed the causal gene lower. Each ranked gene is accompanied by LLM-generated reasoning that integrates phenotypic, inheritance, and variant-level evidence, thereby making the output more interpretable and facilitating clinical review.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demo: Statistically Significant Results On Biases and Errors of LLMs Do Not Guarantee Generalizable Results](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02246v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has shown that hallucinations, omissions, and biases are prevalent in everyday use-cases of LLMs. However, chatbots used in medical contexts must provide consistent advice in situations where non-medical factors are involved, such as when demographic information is present. In order to understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code and dataset are available here: https://github.com/BBN-E/medic-neurips-2025-demo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Ideation: Designing LLM Agents to Generate Novel Research Ideas on Scientific Concept Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02238v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel research ideas play a critical role in advancing scientific inquiries. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential to generate novel research ideas by leveraging large-scale scientific literature. However, previous work in research ideation has primarily relied on simplistic methods, such as keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity. These approaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but overlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts, which are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human literature. For instance, papers that simultaneously mention "keyword A" and "keyword B" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts. Additionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using the model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the scientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established research. To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework to address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven ideation. The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to iteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress. A critic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by providing continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas. Our experiments show that our approach improves the quality of generated ideas by 10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference acceptance levels. Human evaluation highlights their practical value in scientific research, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in the workflow.

| **[Continuum: Efficient and Robust Multi-Turn LLM Agent Scheduling with KV Cache Time-to-Live](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02230v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic LLM applications interleave LLM generation requests with tool calls. These tool calls break the continuity of the workflow by creating pauses between LLM requests, bringing many challenges for the serving system, especially under multi-turn scenarios. Each pause potentially causes KV cache eviction and extra waiting time before entering the continuous batch for the following LLM request. Since these pauses happen for each call, this problem becomes increasingly severe as turn number grow for agentic programs. Previous works either fail to incorporate information from the tool call, evicting KV cache that leads to repetitive prefill or loading, or ignore the continuity of a multi-turn program, creating waiting time between turns that increases per-request latency. We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for multi-turn agent workloads by combining tool-aware KV cache timeout with program-level scheduling. By predicting tool call durations in agentic workflows, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a time-to-live value based on total turn number. When combined with program-level first-come-first-serve, Continuum prevents scheduling bubbles, preserves multi-turn continuity, and optimizes for throughput for complex agentic workflows. By modeling the variability of tool call and agent program continuity, Continuum outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation on real-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B models shows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times, and remains performant across different hardware setups and DRAM offloading schemes.

Android applications are often known for collecting, storing, and sharing sensitive user information such as contacts, location, camera, and microphone data often without the user's clear consent or awareness raising significant privacy risks and exposure. In the context of privacy assessment, dataflow analysis is particularly valuable for identifying data usage and potential leaks. Traditionally, this type of analysis has relied on formal methods, heuristics, and rule-based matching. However, these techniques are often complex to implement and prone to errors, such as taint explosion for large programs. Moreover, most existing Android dataflow analysis methods depend heavily on predefined list of sinks, limiting their flexibility and scalability. To address the limitations of these existing techniques, we propose AndroByte, an AI-driven privacy analysis tool that leverages LLM reasoning on bytecode summarization to dynamically generate accurate and explainable dataflow call graphs from static code analysis. AndroByte achieves a significant F\b{eta}-Score of 89% in generating dynamic dataflow call graphs on the fly, outperforming the effectiveness of traditional tools like FlowDroid and Amandroid in leak detection without relying on predefined propagation rules or sink lists. Moreover, AndroByte's iterative bytecode summarization provides comprehensive and explainable insights into dataflow and leak detection, achieving high, quantifiable scores based on the G-Eval metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) 2025</p></details> |

We introduce UserVille, an interactive environment with LLM-based user simulators enabling diverse, configurable user preferences. Leveraging UserVille, we introduce PPP, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes all three dimensions: Productivity, Proactivity, and Personalization. Experiments on software engineering and deep research tasks show that agents trained with PPP achieve substantial improvements over strong baselines such as GPT-5 (+21.6 on average), demonstrating the ability to ask strategic clarifying questions, adapt to unseen user preferences, and improve task success through better interaction. This work demonstrates that explicitly optimizing for user-centered interaction is critical for building practical and effective AI agents.</p></details> |  |

They can be used in the specification of autonomous driving, avionics, air traffic control, and similar systems. They aim to reduce risks of harm of all kinds including human mortality, environmental damage, and financial loss. However, assurance cases often tend to be organized as extensive documents spanning hundreds of pages, making their creation, review, and maintenance error-prone, time-consuming, and tedious. Therefore, there is a growing need to leverage (semi-)automated techniques, such as those powered by generative AI and large language models (LLMs), to enhance efficiency, consistency, and accuracy across the entire assurance-case lifecycle. In this paper, we focus on assurance case review, a critical task that ensures the quality of assurance cases and therefore fosters their acceptance by regulatory authorities. We propose a novel approach that leverages the \textit{LLM-as-a-judge} paradigm to automate the review process. Specifically, we propose new predicate-based rules that formalize well-established assurance case review criteria, allowing us to craft LLM prompts tailored to the review task. Our experiments on several state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) show that, while most LLMs yield relatively good review capabilities, DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1 demonstrate superior performance, with DeepSeek-R1 ultimately outperforming GPT-4.1. However, our experimental results also suggest that human reviewers are still needed to refine the reviews LLMs yield.</p></details> |  |

Confidence estimation serves as an effective and convenient approach for evaluating these aspects. This paper proposes a confidence analysis and enhancement framework for LLMs tailored to code reasoning tasks. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the confidence reliability of mainstream LLMs across different tasks, and further evaluate the effectiveness of techniques such as prompt strategy optimisation and mathematical calibration (e.g., Platt Scaling) in improving confidence reliability. Our results show that DeepSeek-Reasoner achieves the best performance across various tasks, outperforming other models by up to $0.680$, $0.636$, and $13.652$ in terms of ECE, Brier Score, and Performance Score, respectively. The hybrid strategy combining the reassess prompt strategy and Platt Scaling achieves improvements of up to $0.541$, $0.628$, and $15.084$ over the original performance in the aforementioned three metrics. These results indicate that models with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior confidence reliability, and that the hybrid strategy is the most effective in enhancing the confidence reliability of various models. Meanwhile, we elucidate the impact of different task complexities, model scales, and strategies on confidence performance, and highlight that the confidence of current LLMs in complex reasoning tasks still has considerable room for improvement. This study not only provides a research foundation and technical reference for the application of confidence in LLM-assisted software engineering, but also points the way for future optimisation and engineering deployment of confidence mechanisms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

However, the conventional bulk synchronous parallel~(BSP) model used in such settings introduces significant performance inefficiencies. To characterize these bottlenecks, we introduce the ''Three Taxes'' (Bulk Synchronous, Inter-Kernel Data Locality, and Kernel Launch Overhead) as an analytical framework. We propose moving beyond the rigid BSP model to address key inefficiencies in distributed GPU execution. By exploiting libraries like Iris for Triton, we gain access to in-kernel communication primitives that enable the design of novel fine-grained programming patterns, offering greater flexibility and performance than traditional BSP-based approaches. These patterns systematically eliminate the three taxes by creating direct, tile-level producer-consumer pipelines and replacing global barriers with fine-grained dataflow synchronization. Applying this methodology to critical kernels, from the foundational All-Gather + general matrix multiplication operation to the complex Flash Decode algorithm, we observe a 10-20% speedup in end-to-end latency over BSP-based approaches, establishing a more programmable and efficient paradigm for distributed LLM workloads.</p></details> |  |

However, are LLMs strictly necessary, or can smaller, domain-grounded models suffice? We identify a large class of simulation problems in which individuals make choices among discrete options, where a graph neural network (GNN) can match or surpass strong LLM baselines despite being three orders of magnitude smaller. We introduce Graph-basEd Models for human Simulation (GEMS), which casts discrete choice simulation tasks as a link prediction problem on graphs, leveraging relational knowledge while incorporating language representations only when needed. Evaluations across three key settings on three simulation datasets show that GEMS achieves comparable or better accuracy than LLMs, with far greater efficiency, interpretability, and transparency, highlighting the promise of graph-based modeling as a lightweight alternative to LLMs for human simulation.

To this end, we present DiscoTrack, an LLM benchmark target- ing a range of tasks across 12 languages and four levels of discourse understanding: salience recognition, entity tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference.

| **[LLMs as Layout Designers: Enhanced Spatial Reasoning for Content-Aware Layout Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16891v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning and planning abilities in textual domains and can effectively follow instructions for complex tasks, their ability to understand and manipulate spatial relationships remains limited. Such capabilities are crucial for content-aware graphic layout design, where the goal is to arrange heterogeneous elements onto a canvas so that final design remains visually balanced and structurally feasible. This problem requires precise coordination of placement, alignment, and structural organization of multiple elements within a constrained visual space. To address this limitation, we introduce LaySPA, a reinforcement learning-based framework that augments LLM-based agents with explicit spatial reasoning capabilities for layout design. LaySPA employs hybrid reward signals that jointly capture geometric constraints, structural fidelity, and visual quality, enabling agents to navigate the canvas, model inter-element relationships, and optimize spatial arrangements. Through group-relative policy optimization, the agent generates content-aware layouts that reflect salient regions, respect spatial constraints, and produces an interpretable reasoning trace explaining placement decisions and a structured layout specification. Experimental results show that LaySPA substantially improves the generation of structurally valid and visually appealing layouts, outperforming larger general-purpose LLMs and achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art specialized layout models.</p></details> |  |

Manually tuning this combination is tedious, error-prone, and specific to a given LLM and task. Therefore, this paper proposes AutoPDL, an automated approach to discovering good LLM agent configurations. Our approach frames this as a structured AutoML problem over a combinatorial space of agentic and non-agentic prompting patterns and demonstrations, using successive halving to efficiently navigate this space. We introduce a library implementing common prompting patterns using the PDL prompt programming language. AutoPDL solutions are human-readable, editable, and executable PDL programs that use this library. This approach also enables source-to-source optimization, allowing human-in-the-loop refinement and reuse. Evaluations across three tasks and seven LLMs (ranging from 3B to 70B parameters) show consistent accuracy gains ($9.21\pm15.46$ percentage points), up to 67.5pp, and reveal that selected prompting strategies vary across models and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ea...</summary><p>An earlier version of this paper was published in AutoML 2025 Methods Track.

Traditional Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) focus primarily on code authoring, lacking intelligent support for the full ML lifecycle, while existing MLOps platforms remain detached from the coding workflow. To address this gap, this study proposes the design of an LLM-Integrated IDE with automated MLOps pipelines that enables continuous model development and monitoring within a single environment. The proposed system embeds a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant capable of code generation, debugging recommendation, and automatic pipeline configuration. The backend incorporates automated data validation, feature storage, drift detection, retraining triggers, and CI/CD deployment orchestration. This framework was implemented in a prototype named SmartMLOps Studio and evaluated using classification and forecasting tasks on the UCI Adult and M5 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartMLOps Studio reduces pipeline configuration time by 61%, improves experiment reproducibility by 45%, and increases drift detection accuracy by 14% compared to traditional workflows. By bridging intelligent code assistance and automated operational pipelines, this research establishes a novel paradigm for AI engineering - transforming the IDE from a static coding tool into a dynamic, lifecycle-aware intelligent platform for scalable and efficient model development.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Social Welfare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning, yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice: models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During training, we introduce a social welfare reward that reinforces cooperative responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and social welfare compared to baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GTAlign .</p></details> | 31 pages, 6 figures |

However, LLMs have been shown to reproduce biases regarding the prioritization of sustainable business strategies. Thus, it is important to identify underlying training data biases that LLMs pertain regarding the importance and role of sustainable business and supply chain practices. This study investigates how different LLMs respond to validated surveys about the role of ethics and responsibility for businesses, and the importance of sustainable practices and relations with suppliers and customers. Using standardized questionnaires, we systematically analyze responses generated by state-of-the-art LLMs to identify variations. We further evaluate whether differences are augmented by four organizational culture types, thereby evaluating the practical relevance of identified biases. The findings reveal significant systematic differences between models and demonstrate that organizational culture prompts substantially modify LLM responses. The study holds important implications for LLM-assisted decision-making in sustainability contexts.</p></details> | 37 pages, 2 figures |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v6)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[KV Cache Transform Coding for Compact Storage in LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01815v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serving large language models (LLMs) at scale necessitates efficient key-value (KV) cache management. KV caches can be reused across conversation turns via shared-prefix prompts that are common in iterative code editing and chat. However, stale caches consume scarce GPU memory, require offloading, or force recomputation. We present KVTC, a lightweight transform coder that compresses KV caches for compact on-GPU and off-GPU storage. Drawing on classical media compression, KVTC combines PCA-based feature decorrelation, adaptive quantization, and entropy coding. It requires only a brief initial calibration and leaves model parameters unchanged. By exploiting redundancies in KV caches, KVTC achieves up to 20$\times$ compression while maintaining reasoning and long-context accuracy, and 40$\times$ or higher for specific use cases. We test KVTC with Llama 3, Mistral NeMo, and R1-Qwen 2.5 models across benchmarks including AIME25, LiveCodeBench, GSM8K, MMLU, Qasper, RULER, and MATH-500. It consistently outperforms inference-time baselines such as token eviction, quantization, and SVD-based methods, while achieving higher compression ratios. These results support KVTC as a practical building block for memory-efficient LLM serving with reusable KV caches.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches to length control, including Regularized DPO, Length-Instruction Fine Tuning, and tool-augmented methods, typically require expensive model retraining or complex inference-time tooling. This paper presents a prompt engineering methodology that enables precise length control without model retraining. Our structure-guided approach implements deliberate planning and word counting mechanisms within the prompt, encouraging the model to carefully track and adhere to specified length constraints. Comprehensive evaluations across six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that our method significantly improves length fidelity for several models compared to standard prompting when applied to document summarization tasks, particularly for shorter-to-medium length constraints. The proposed technique shows varying benefits across different model architectures, with some models demonstrating up to 37.6% improvement in length adherence. Quality evaluations further reveal that our approach maintains or enhances overall output quality compared to standard prompting techniques. Our approach provides an immediately deployable solution for applications requiring precise length control, particularly valuable for production environments where model retraining is impractical or cost-prohibitive.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Workshop on Prompt Optimization, KDD 2025, Toronto, Canada</p></details> |

Despite hosting hundreds of reusable workflows across domains, Galaxy's current keyword-based retrieval system offers limited support for semantic query interpretation and often fails to surface relevant workflows when exact term matches are absent. To address this gap, we propose a task-aware, two-stage retrieval framework that integrates dense vector search with large language model (LLM)-based reranking. Our system first retrieves candidate workflows using state-of-the-art embedding models and then reranks them using instruction-tuned generative LLMs (GPT-4o, Mistral-7B) based on semantic task alignment. To support robust evaluation, we construct a benchmark dataset of Galaxy workflows annotated with semantic topics via BERTopic and synthesize realistic task-oriented queries using LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive comparison of lexical, dense, and reranking models using standard IR metrics, presenting the first systematic evaluation of retrieval performance in the Galaxy ecosystem. Results show that our approach significantly improves top-k accuracy and relevance, particularly for long or under-specified queries. We further integrate our system as a prototype tool within Galaxy, providing a proof-of-concept for LLM-enhanced workflow search. This work advances the usability and accessibility of scientific workflows, especially for novice users and interdisciplinary researchers.</p></details> |  |

We propose a Hierarchical Scam Detection System (HSDS) that combines a lightweight multi-model voting front end with a fine-tuned LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct back end to improve accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks. An ensemble of four classifiers provides preliminary predictions through majority vote, and ambiguous cases are escalated to the fine-tuned model, which is optimized with adversarial training to reduce misclassification. Experiments show that this hierarchical design both improves adversarial scam detection and shortens inference time by routing most cases away from the LLM, outperforming traditional machine-learning baselines and proprietary LLM baselines. The findings highlight the effectiveness of a hybrid voting mechanism and adversarial fine-tuning in fortifying LLMs against evolving scam tactics, enhancing the resilience of automated scam detection systems.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, as shown by many studies, writing or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is challenging.

In order to address this, we present WAPIIBench, a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of the evaluated open-source models was able to solve more than 40% of the tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of 2025 2nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software (AIware), Data & Benchmark Track; switched to IEEE conference template</p></details> |

Our approach addresses the brittleness of traditional deep learning models in financial applications by: employing prompt-engineered LLMs to generate executable alpha factor candidates across diverse financial data, implementing multimodal agent-based evaluation that filters factors based on market status, predictive quality while maintaining category balance, and deploying dynamic weight optimization that adapts to market conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the robust performance of the strategy in Chinese & US market regimes compared to established benchmarks. Our work extends LLMs capabilities to quantitative trading, providing a scalable architecture for financial signal extraction and portfolio construction. The overall framework significantly outperforms all benchmarks with 53.17% cumulative return on SSE50 (Jan 2023 to Jan 2024), demonstrating superior risk-adjusted performance and downside protection on the market.</p></details> |  |

However, scaling up model sizes results in exponentially higher computational costs and energy consumption, making these models impractical for academic researchers and businesses with limited resources. At the same time, Small Models (SMs) are frequently used in practical settings, although their significance is currently underestimated. This raises important questions about the role of small models in the era of LLMs, a topic that has received limited attention in prior research. In this work, we systematically examine the relationship between LLMs and SMs from two key perspectives: Collaboration and Competition. We hope this survey provides valuable insights for practitioners, fostering a deeper understanding of the contribution of small models and promoting more efficient use of computational resources.

We present GLM, the first multi-agent Graph-CoT system co-designed with an optimized LLM serving architecture. GLM decomposes reasoning into specialized agents for classification, reasoning, action generation, and graph retrieval, enabling branching and selective context sharing to reduce prompt length and reasoning iterations while preserving reasoning quality, thereby improving accuracy and reducing overall token consumption. To scale inference, we introduce a Graph-CoT-aware LLM inference mechanism with graph-specific KV-cache management, priority-based eviction, and pipelined execution to improve serving efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that GLM improves answer accuracy by up to 38%, reduces token cost by up to 95.7%, lowers inference latency by 90.3%, and achieves up to 15.1x higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art Graph-CoT baselines, enabling efficient adoption for complex real-world reasoning at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[L2T-Tune:LLM-Guided Hybrid Database Tuning with LHS and TD3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01602v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Configuration tuning is critical for database performance. Although recent advancements in database tuning have shown promising results in throughput and latency improvement, challenges remain. First, the vast knob space makes direct optimization unstable and slow to converge. Second, reinforcement learning pipelines often lack effective warm-start guidance and require long offline training. Third, transferability is limited: when hardware or workloads change, existing models typically require substantial retraining to recover performance. To address these limitations, we propose L2T-Tune, a new LLM-guided hybrid database tuning framework that features a three-stage pipeline: Stage one performs a warm start that simultaneously generates uniform samples across the knob space and logs them into a shared pool; Stage two leverages a large language model to mine and prioritize tuning hints from manuals and community documents for rapid convergence. Stage three uses the warm-start sample pool to reduce the dimensionality of knobs and state features, then fine-tunes the configuration with the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. We conduct experiments on L2T-Tune and the state-of-the-art models. Compared with the best-performing alternative, our approach improves performance by an average of 37.1% across all workloads, and by up to 73% on TPC-C. Compared with models trained with reinforcement learning, it achieves rapid convergence in the offline tuning stage on a single server. Moreover, during the online tuning stage, it only takes 30 steps to achieve best results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Consistent Detection of Cognitive Distortions: LLM-Based Annotation and Dataset-Agnostic Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01482v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based automated Cognitive Distortion detection is a challenging task due to its subjective nature, with low agreement scores observed even among expert human annotators, leading to unreliable annotations. We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as consistent and reliable annotators, and propose that multiple independent LLM runs can reveal stable labeling patterns despite the inherent subjectivity of the task. Furthermore, to fairly compare models trained on datasets with different characteristics, we introduce a dataset-agnostic evaluation framework using Cohen's kappa as an effect size measure. This methodology allows for fair cross-dataset and cross-study comparisons where traditional metrics like F1 score fall short. Our results show that GPT-4 can produce consistent annotations (Fleiss's Kappa = 0.78), resulting in improved test set performance for models trained on these annotations compared to those trained on human-labeled data. Our findings suggest that LLMs can offer a scalable and internally consistent alternative for generating training data that supports strong downstream performance in subjective NLP tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Consistency for Accurate and Coherent LLM Answer Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21590v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%) over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025.

This paper introduces a reproducible draft-based refinement pipeline that elevates open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to a performance level statistically comparable to top-tier proprietary systems. Our method first uses a fine-tuned NLLB-1.3B model to generate a high-quality, structurally faithful draft. A zero-shot LLM (Llama-3.3 or Qwen3) then polishes this draft, a process that can be further enhanced by augmenting the context with retrieved out-context examples (RAG). We demonstrate the robustness of this approach on two distinct benchmarks: a standard in-domain test set (Rosenthal, 2023) and a new, challenging out-of-domain (OOD) set of 12th-century Latin letters (2025). Our central finding is that this open-source RAG system achieves performance statistically comparable to the GPT-5 baseline, without any task-specific LLM fine-tuning. We release the pipeline, the Chartres OOD set, and evaluation scripts and models to facilitate replicability and further research.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end assessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It comprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and uncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research environment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2. Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management, and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over 11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the next generation of code-based research benchmark.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable inferences and validate them via two instantiation. This theory offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Ensuring their semantic correctness is challenging, since existing rule-based frameworks rely on manually written formulas and domain-specific functions, limiting scalability. In this paper, We present an LLM-assisted pipeline that jointly generates logical formulas and corresponding executable predicates within a computational FOL framework, extending the map verifier in CommonRoad scenario designer with elevation support. The pipeline leverages prompt-based LLM generation to produce grammar-compliant rules and predicates that integrate directly into the existing system. We implemented a prototype and evaluated it on synthetic bridge and slope scenarios. The results indicate reduced manual engineering effort while preserving correctness, demonstrating the feasibility of a scalable, semi-automated human-in-the-loop approach to map-transformation verification.</p></details> |  |

Jailbreaks, in which adversaries bypass safeguards with crafted input prompts, play a central role in red-teaming by probing LLMs to elicit unintended or unsafe behaviors. Recent optimization-based jailbreak approaches iteratively refine attack prompts by leveraging LLMs. However, they often rely heavily on either binary attack success rate (ASR) signals, which are sparse, or manually crafted scoring templates, which introduce human bias and uncertainty in the scoring outcomes. To address these limitations, we introduce AMIS (Align to MISalign), a meta-optimization framework that jointly evolves jailbreak prompts and scoring templates through a bi-level structure. In the inner loop, prompts are refined using fine-grained and dense feedback using a fixed scoring template. In the outer loop, the template is optimized using an ASR alignment score, gradually evolving to better reflect true attack outcomes across queries. This co-optimization process yields progressively stronger jailbreak prompts and more calibrated scoring signals. Evaluations on AdvBench and JBB-Behaviors demonstrate that AMIS achieves state-of-the-art performance, including 88.0% ASR on Claude-3.5-Haiku and 100.0% ASR on Claude-4-Sonnet, outperforming existing baselines by substantial margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review, 28 pages</p></details> |

With proven capabilities in understanding user preferences, LLM personalization has emerged as a critical area for providing tailored responses to individuals. Current studies explore personalization through prompt design and fine-tuning, paving the way for further research in personalized LLMs. However, existing approaches are either costly and inefficient in capturing diverse user preferences or fail to account for timely updates to user history. To address these gaps, we propose the Memory-Assisted Personalized LLM (MAP). Through user interactions, we first create a history profile for each user, capturing their preferences, such as ratings for historical items. During recommendation, we extract relevant memory based on similarity, which is then incorporated into the prompts to enhance personalized recommendations. In our experiments, we define a new task that enables testing with varying memory size under two scenarios: single domain where memory and tasks are from the same category and cross-domain (e.g. memory from movies and recommendation tasks in books). The results show that MAP outperforms regular LLM-based recommenders that integrate user history directly through prompt design. Moreover, as user history grows, MAP's advantage increases in both scenarios, making it more suitable for addressing successive personalized user requests.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Curriculum learning as a typical data organization strategy has shown preliminary effectiveness in instruction tuning. However, current curriculum tuning methods suffer from the curriculum rigidity, since they rely solely on static heuristic difficulty metrics. These methods fail to adapt to the evolving capabilities of models during training, resulting in a fixed and potentially sub-optimal learning trajectory. To address the issue, Competence-Aware Multi-Perspective cUrriculum inStruction tuning framework termed CAMPUS is proposed. CAMPUS offers several advantages: (1) Dynamic selection for sub-curriculum. (2) Competency-aware adjustment to the curriculum schedule. (3) Multiple difficulty-based scheduling.

Existing QA benchmarks rarely evaluate both challenges jointly. To address this, we introduce DeepAmbigQAGen, an automatic data generation pipeline that constructs QA tasks grounded in text corpora and linked knowledge graph, generating natural and verifiable questions that systematically embed name ambiguity and multi-step reasoning. Based on this, we build DeepAmbigQA, a dataset of 3,600 questions requiring multi-hop reasoning and half of them explicit name ambiguity resolving. Experiments reveal that, even state-of-the-art GPT-5 show incomplete answers, achieving only 0.13 exact match on ambiguous questions and 0.21 on non-ambiguous questions. These findings highlight the need for more robust QA systems aimed at information gathering and answer completeness.</p></details> | 25 pages |

Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full retraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is thus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more viable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1) representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To address these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, an enhanced benchmark with broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both single and batch edits under strict locality constraints. We then propose MedREK, a retrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key module for precise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for informative guidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks demonstrate that our MedREK achieves superior performance across different core metrics and provides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/mylittleriver/MedREK.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |

A particularly popular attribution method is based on the Shapley value from cooperative game theory, a measure that guarantees the satisfaction of several desirable principles, assuming deterministic inference. We apply the Shapley value to feature attribution in large language model (LLM)-based decision support systems, where inference is, by design, stochastic (non-deterministic). We then demonstrate when we can and cannot guarantee Shapley value principle satisfaction across different implementation variants applied to LLM-based decision support, and analyze how the stochastic nature of LLMs affects these guarantees. We also highlight trade-offs between explainable inference speed, agreement with exact Shapley value attributions, and principle attainment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Reasoning Abilities of Small LLMs with Cognitive Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09802v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have seen substantial advancements through deep thinking. However, these enhancements come with significant resource demands, underscoring the need for training effective small reasoning models. A critical challenge is that small models possess different reasoning capacities and cognitive trajectories compared with their larger counterparts. Hence, directly distilling chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales from large LRMs to smaller ones can sometimes be ineffective and often requires a substantial amount of annotated data. In this paper, we first introduce a novel Critique-Rethink-Verify (CRV) system, designed for training smaller yet powerful LRMs. Our CRV system consists of multiple LLM agents, each specializing in unique tasks: (i) critiquing the CoT rationales according to the cognitive capabilities of smaller models, (ii) rethinking and refining these CoTs based on the critiques, and (iii) verifying the correctness of the refined results. Building on the CRV system, we further propose the Cognitive Preference Optimization (CogPO) algorithm to continuously enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models by aligning their reasoning processes with their cognitive capacities. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our CRV+CogPO framework, which outperforms other methods by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>emnlp...</summary><p>emnlp 2025 main conference</p></details> |

While existing INT4/INT8 quantization reduces these costs, they often degrade accuracy or lack optimal efficiency. INT6 quantization offers a superior trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency, but lacks hardware support in modern GPUs, forcing emulation via higher-precision arithmetic units that limit acceleration. In this paper, we propose FlexQ, a novel post-training INT6 quantization framework combining algorithmic innovation with system-level optimizations. FlexQ employs uniform 6-bit weight quantization across all layers, with adaptive retention of 8-bit activations in layers identified through layer-wise sensitivity analysis. To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized high-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8 representations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing the lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA family models show FlexQ maintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.1 on WikiText2. The proposed kernel achieves an average 1.39$\times$ speedup over ABQ-LLM on LLaMA-2-70B linear layers. End-to-end, FlexQ delivers 1.33$\times$ inference acceleration and 1.21$\times$ memory savings over SmoothQuant. Code is released at https://github.com/FlyFoxPlayer/FlexQ.</p></details> |  |

We introduce AraFinNews, the largest publicly available Arabic financial news dataset to date, comprising 212,500 article-headline pairs spanning nearly a decade of reporting from October 2015 to July 2025. Designed as the Arabic equivalent of major English summarisation corpora such as CNN/DailyMail, AraFinNews provides a robust benchmark for evaluating domain-specific language understanding and generation in financial contexts. Using this resource, we evaluate transformer-based models -- including mT5, AraT5, and the domain-adapted FinAraT5 -- to examine how financial-domain pretraining influences factual accuracy, numerical reliability, and stylistic alignment with professional reporting. Experimental results show that domain-adapted models generate more faithful and coherent summaries, particularly in handling quantitative and entity-centric information. The findings highlight the importance of domain-specific adaptation for improving factual consistency and narrative fluency in Arabic financial summarisation. The dataset is freely available for non-commercial research at https://github.com/ArabicNLP-UK/AraFinNews.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Identifying vulnerable functions in target binaries alone is insufficient; it is also crucial to determine whether these functions have been patched. Existing methods, however, suffer from limited usability and accuracy. They often depend on the compilation process to extract features, requiring substantial manual effort and failing for certain software. Moreover, they cannot reliably differentiate between code changes caused by patches or compilation variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lares, a scalable and accurate method for patch presence testing. Lares introduces Code Slice Semantic Search, which directly extracts features from the patch source code and identifies semantically equivalent code slices in the pseudocode of the target binary. By eliminating the need for the compilation process, Lares improves usability, while leveraging large language models (LLMs) for code analysis and SMT solvers for logical reasoning to enhance accuracy. Experimental results show that Lares achieves superior precision, recall, and usability. Furthermore, it is the first work to evaluate patch presence testing across optimization levels, architectures, and compilers. The datasets and source code used in this article are available at https://github.com/Siyuan-Li201/Lares.</p></details> |  |

Based on findings from a formative study with 24 students and 12 instructors, we designed AskNow, an LLM-powered system that enables students to ask questions and receive real-time, context-aware responses grounded in the ongoing lecture and that allows instructors to view students' questions collectively. We deployed AskNow in three university computer science courses and tested with 117 students. To evaluate AskNow's responses, each instructor rated the perceived correctness and satisfaction of 100 randomly sampled AskNow-generated responses. In addition, we conducted interviews with 24 students and the three instructors to understand their experience with AskNow. We found that AskNow significantly reduced students' perceived time to resolve confusion. Instructors rated AskNow's responses as highly accurate and satisfactory. Instructor and student feedback provided insights into supporting real-time learning in large lecture settings.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

However, identifying relevant documents for queries that require in-depth reasoning remains a major challenge. Reasoning-intensive queries often exhibit multifaceted information needs and nuanced interpretations, rendering document relevance inherently context dependent. To address this, we propose contextual relevance, which we define as the probability that a document is relevant to a given query, marginalized over the distribution of different reranking contexts it may appear in (i.e., the set of candidate documents it is ranked alongside and the order in which the documents are presented to a reranking model). While prior works have studied methods to mitigate the positional bias LLMs exhibit by accounting for the ordering of documents, we empirically find that the compositions of these batches also plays an important role in reranking performance. To efficiently estimate contextual relevance, we propose TS-SetRank, a sampling-based, uncertainty-aware reranking algorithm. Empirically, TS-SetRank improves nDCG@10 over retrieval and reranking baselines by 15-25% on BRIGHT and 6-21% on BEIR, highlighting the importance of modeling relevance as context-dependent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forget BIT, It is All about TOKEN: Towards Semantic Information Theory for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01202v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in numerous real-world applications. While the vast majority of research conducted from an experimental perspective is progressing rapidly, it demands substantial computational power, data, and other resources. Therefore, how to open the black-box of LLMs from a theoretical standpoint has become a critical challenge. This paper takes the theory of rate-distortion function, directed information, and Granger causality as its starting point to investigate the information-theoretic principles behind LLMs, leading to the development of semantic information theory for LLMs, where the fundamental unit is token, rather than bits that lacks any semantic meaning. By defining the probabilistic model of LLMs, we discuss structure-agnostic information-theoretic measures, such as the directed rate-distortion function in pre-training, the directed rate-reward function in post-training, and the semantic information flow in inference phase. This paper also delves deeply into the theory of token-level semantic embedding and the information-theoretically optimal vectorization method. Thereafter, we propose a general definition of autoregression LLM, where the Transformer architecture and its performance such as ELBO, generalization error bound, memory capacity, and semantic information measures can be derived theoretically. Other architectures, such as Mamba/Mamba2 and LLaDA, are also discussed in our framework. Consequently, this paper provides a theoretical framework for understanding LLMs from the perspective of semantic information theory, which also offers the necessary theoretical tools for further in-depth research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computational Basis of LLM's Decision Making in Social Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11671v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as human-like decision-making agents in social science and applied settings. These LLM-agents are typically assigned human-like characters and placed in real-life contexts. However, how these characters and contexts shape an LLM's behavior remains underexplored. This study proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying an LLM's internal representations in a Dictator Game -- a classic behavioral experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior. We extract "vectors of variable variations" (e.g., "male" to "female") from the LLM's internal state. Manipulating these vectors during the model's inference can substantially alter how those variables relate to the model's decision-making. This approach offers a principled way to study and regulate how social concepts can be encoded and engineered within transformer-based models, with implications for alignment, debiasing, and designing AI agents for social simulations in both academic and commercial applications, strengthening sociological theory and measurement.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZoFia: Zero-Shot Fake News Detection with Entity-Guided Retrieval and Multi-LLM Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01188v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid spread of fake news threatens social stability and public trust, rendering its detection an imperative research priority. Although large language models (LLMs) excel at numerous natural language processing tasks with their remarkable contextual understanding and extensive prior knowledge, the time-bounded knowledge coverage and tendency for generating hallucination content reduce their reliability when handling fast-evolving news streams. Furthermore, models trained on existing static datasets also often lack the generalization needed for emerging news topics. To address these challenges, we propose ZoFia, a novel two-stage zero-shot fake news detection framework. First, we introduce Hierarchical Salience to quantify the importance of entities in the news content, and propose the SC-MMR algorithm to effectively select an informative and diverse set of keywords that serve as queries for retrieving up-to-date external evidence. Subsequently, a multi LLM interactive system, in which each agent assumes a distinct role, performs multi-view collaborative analysis and adversarial debate over the news text and its related information, and finally produces an interpretable and robust judgment. Comprehensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that ZoFia obviously outperforms existing zero-shot baselines and most of few-shot methods. Our codes will be open-sourced to facilitate related communities.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DebateBias-8K, a new multilingual, debate-style benchmark designed to reveal how narrative bias appears in realistic generative settings. Our dataset includes 8,400 structured debate prompts spanning four sensitive domains: women's rights, socioeconomic development, terrorism, and religion, across seven languages ranging from high-resource (English, Chinese) to low-resource (Swahili, Nigerian Pidgin). Using four flagship models (GPT-4o, Claude 3, DeepSeek, and LLaMA 3), we generate and automatically classify over 100,000 responses. Results show that all models reproduce entrenched stereotypes despite safety alignment: Arabs are overwhelmingly linked to terrorism and religion (>=95%), Africans to socioeconomic "backwardness" (up to <=77%), and Western groups are consistently framed as modern or progressive. Biases grow sharply in lower-resource languages, revealing that alignment trained primarily in English does not generalize globally. Our findings highlight a persistent divide in multilingual fairness: current alignment methods reduce explicit toxicity but fail to prevent biased outputs in open-ended contexts. We release our DebateBias-8K benchmark and analysis framework to support the next generation of multilingual bias evaluation and safer, culturally inclusive model alignment.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of LLMs in code clone detection. However, two crucial issues remain unaddressed: the ability of LLMs to achieve comparable performance across different datasets and the consistency of LLMs' responses in code clone detection. To address these issues, we constructed seven code clone datasets and then evaluated five LLMs in four existing prompts with these datasets. The datasets were created by sampling code pairs using their Levenshtein ratio from two different code collections, CodeNet and BigCloneBench. Our evaluation revealed that although LLMs perform well in CodeNet-related datasets, with o3-mini achieving a 0.943 F1 score, their performance significantly decreased in BigCloneBench-related datasets. Most models achieved a high response consistency, with over 90\% of judgments remaining consistent across all five submissions. The fluctuations of the F1 score affected by inconsistency are also tiny; their variations are less than 0.03.</p></details> |  |

One promising yet underexplored direction is microservice remediation, where the goal is to automatically recover faulty microservice systems. Existing approaches, however, still rely on human-crafted prompts from Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), with LLMs merely converting textual instructions into executable code. To advance research in this area, we introduce MicroRemed, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in end-to-end microservice remediation, where models must directly generate executable Ansible playbooks from diagnosis reports to restore system functionality. We further propose ThinkRemed, a multi-agent framework that emulates the reflective and perceptive reasoning of SREs. Experimental results show that MicroRemed presents substantial challenges to current LLMs, while ThinkRemed improves end-to-end remediation performance through iterative reasoning and system reflection.

We demonstrate that this assumption is dangerously flawed. We introduce the threat of watermark spoofing, a sophisticated attack that allows a malicious model to generate text containing the authentic-looking watermark of a trusted, victim model. This enables the seamless misattribution of harmful content, such as disinformation, to reputable sources. The key to our attack is repurposing watermark radioactivity, the unintended inheritance of data patterns during fine-tuning, from a discoverable trait into an attack vector. By distilling knowledge from a watermarked teacher model, our framework allows an attacker to steal and replicate the watermarking signal of the victim model. This work reveals a critical security gap in text authorship verification and calls for a paradigm shift towards technologies capable of distinguishing authentic watermarks from expertly imitated ones.

CTI analysis involves distilling large volumes of unstructured reports into actionable knowledge, a process where LLMs could substantially reduce analyst workload. CTIBench introduced a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs across multiple CTI tasks. In this work, we extend CTIBench by developing AthenaBench, an enhanced benchmark that includes an improved dataset creation pipeline, duplicate removal, refined evaluation metrics, and a new task focused on risk mitigation strategies. We evaluate twelve LLMs, including state-of-the-art proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5 Pro, alongside seven open-source models from the LLaMA and Qwen families. While proprietary LLMs achieve stronger results overall, their performance remains subpar on reasoning-intensive tasks, such as threat actor attribution and risk mitigation, with open-source models trailing even further behind. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in the reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and underscore the need for models explicitly tailored to CTI workflows and automation.</p></details> |  |

However, their inherent vulnerabilities have led to significant financial losses. Traditional auditing methods, while essential, struggle to keep pace with the increasing complexity and scale of smart contracts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating vulnerability detection, but their adoption is often limited by high computational costs. Although prior work has explored leveraging large models through agents or workflows, relatively little attention has been given to improving the performance of smaller, fine-tuned models--a critical factor for achieving both efficiency and data privacy. In this paper, we introduce HKT-SmartAudit, a framework for developing lightweight models optimized for smart contract auditing. It features a multi-stage knowledge distillation pipeline that integrates classical distillation, external domain knowledge, and reward-guided learning to transfer high-quality insights from large teacher models. A single-task learning strategy is employed to train compact student models that maintain high accuracy and robustness while significantly reducing computational overhead. Experimental results show that our distilled models outperform both commercial tools and larger models in detecting complex vulnerabilities and logical flaws, offering a practical, secure, and scalable solution for smart contract auditing.

| **[Causal Graph Neural Networks for Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02531v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</p></details> |  |

However, in GNSS-denied areas, satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view, heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations, or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment, content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps, such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, Submitted to IEEE TIM</p></details> |

This paper presents HybridST, a hybrid architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), multi-head temporal Transformers, and supervised ensemble learning methods (XGBoost or Random Forest) to collectively capture spatial dependencies, long-range temporal patterns, and exogenous signals, including weather, calendar, or control states. We test our model on the METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and Seattle Loop tree public benchmark datasets. These datasets include situations ranging from freeway sensor networks to vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception. Experimental results show that HybridST consistently beats classical baselines (LSTM, GCN, DCRNN, PDFormer) on important metrics like MAE and RMSE, while still being very scalable and easy to understand. The proposed framework presents a promising avenue for real-time urban mobility planning, energy optimization, and congestion alleviation strategies, especially within the framework of smart cities and significant events such as the 2030 FIFA World Cup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Link Prediction with Untrained Message Passing Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16687v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) operate on graphs by exchanging information between neigbouring nodes. MPNNs have been successfully applied to various node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks in areas like molecular science, computer vision, natural language processing, and combinatorial optimization. However, most MPNNs require training on large amounts of labeled data, which can be costly and time-consuming. In this work, we explore the use of various untrained message passing layers in graph neural networks, i.e. variants of popular message passing architecture where we remove all trainable parameters that are used to transform node features in the message passing step. Focusing on link prediction, we find that untrained message passing layers can lead to competitive and even superior performance compared to fully trained MPNNs, especially in the presence of high-dimensional features. We provide a theoretical analysis of untrained message passing by relating the inner products of features implicitly produced by untrained message passing layers to path-based topological node similarity measures. As such, untrained message passing architectures can be viewed as a highly efficient and interpretable approach to link prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GNNs exhibit poor generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Graph Neural Architecture Search via Monte-Carlo Tree Search (Full version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15734v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The number of graph neural network (GNN) architectures has increased rapidly due to the growing adoption of graph analysis. Although we use GNNs in wide application scenarios, it is a laborious task to design/select optimal GNN architectures in diverse graphs. To reduce human efforts, graph neural architecture search (Graph NAS) has been used to search for a sub-optimal GNN architecture that combines existing components. However, existing Graph NAS methods lack explainability to understand the reasons why the model architecture is selected because they use complex search space and neural models to select architecture. Therefore, we propose an explainable Graph NAS method, called ExGNAS, which consists of (i) a simple search space that can adapt to various graphs and (ii) a search algorithm with Monte-Carlo tree that makes the decision process explainable. The combination of our search space and algorithm achieves finding accurate GNN models and the important functions within the search space. We comprehensively evaluate ExGNAS compared with four state-of-the-art Graph NAS methods in twelve graphs. Our experimental results show that ExGNAS achieves high average accuracy and efficiency; improving accuracy up to 26.1% and reducing run time up to 88%. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of explainability by questionnaire-based user study and architecture analysis.</p></details> |  |

Traditional federated recommendation approaches treat each user as an isolated entity, failing to construct global user relationship graphs that capture collaborative signals, which limits the accuracy of recommendations. To address this limitation, we derive insight from the insight that semantic similarity reflects preference. similarity, which can be used to improve the construction of user relationship graphs. This paper proposes UFGraphFR, a novel framework with three key components: 1) On the client side, private structured data is first transformed into text descriptions. These descriptions are then encoded into semantic vectors using pre-trained models; 2) On the server side, user relationship graphs are securely reconstructed using aggregated model weights without accessing raw data, followed by information propagation through lightweight graph neural networks; 3) On the client side, user behavior sequences are personalized using Transformer architectures. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that UFGraphFR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both recommendation accuracy and personalization. The framework also maintains robustness across different pre-trained models, as evidenced by the consistent performance metrics obtained. This work provides a practical method for efficient federated recommendations with strict privacy by using semantic vectors, secure user relationship graphs, and personalized behavior sequences.

Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches. Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained 81.51\% accuracy, 85.94\% sensitivity, 76.36\% specificity, 80.88\% precision, and 83.33\% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific anatomical priors for MDD detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figure, 9 tables</p></details> |

Deploying such services in privacy-critical cloud environments necessitates the development of secure inference (SI) protocols that safeguard sensitive GS data. However, existing SI solutions largely focus on convolutional models for image and text data, leaving the challenge of securing GNNs and GS data relatively underexplored. In this work, we design, implement, and evaluate $\sysname$, a lightweight cryptographic scheme for graph-centric inference in the cloud. By hybridizing additive and function secret sharings within secure two-party computation (2PC), $\sysname$ is carefully designed based on a series of novel 2PC interactive protocols that achieve $1.5\times \sim 1.7\times$ speedups for linear layers and $2\times \sim 15\times$ for non-linear layers over state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions. A thorough theoretical analysis is provided to prove $\sysname$'s correctness, security, and lightweight nature. Extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate $\sysname$'s superior efficiency with $1.3\times \sim 4.7\times$ faster secure predictions while maintaining accuracy comparable to plaintext graph property inference.</p></details> | Accepted to FC'25 |

The critical seed chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3, a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200 test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07 percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent. Cross-validation confirms stability establishing graph neural networks as viable approach for production genomics pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables.

However, are LLMs strictly necessary, or can smaller, domain-grounded models suffice? We identify a large class of simulation problems in which individuals make choices among discrete options, where a graph neural network (GNN) can match or surpass strong LLM baselines despite being three orders of magnitude smaller. We introduce Graph-basEd Models for human Simulation (GEMS), which casts discrete choice simulation tasks as a link prediction problem on graphs, leveraging relational knowledge while incorporating language representations only when needed. Evaluations across three key settings on three simulation datasets show that GEMS achieves comparable or better accuracy than LLMs, with far greater efficiency, interpretability, and transparency, highlighting the promise of graph-based modeling as a lightweight alternative to LLMs for human simulation.

The objective of this systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and 366 papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive review of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in their studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and broadest systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of results from current spatio-temporal GNN models applied to different domains. In its final part, this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability. This paper is complemented by a GitHub repository at https://github.com/FlaGer99/SLR-Spatio-Temporal-GNN.git providing additional interactive tools to further explore the presented findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Microbial Interactions Using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02038v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology, as these interactions are critical to determining the structure and activity of microbial communities. In this work, we used data on monoculture growth capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, NeurIPS 2025 Workshop New Perspectives in Graph Machine Learning</p></details> |
| **[E2Former: An Efficient and Equivariant Transformer with Linear-Scaling Tensor Products](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19216v4)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[RELATE: A Schema-Agnostic Perceiver Encoder for Multimodal Relational Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19954v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce, healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark, where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way toward foundation models for relational graph data.</p></details> | 6 pages |

A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions, and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning. For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far longer training time. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep learning at scale.

Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising solution for scalable Quantum Error Correction (QEC) applications by supporting constant-rate encoding and a sparse parity-check structure. However, decoding QLDPC codes via traditional approaches such as Belief Propagation (BP) suffers from poor convergence in the presence of short cycles. Machine learning techniques like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) utilize learned message passing over their node features; however, they are restricted to pairwise interactions on Tanner graphs, which limits their ability to capture higher-order correlations. In this work, we propose HyperNQ, the first Hypergraph Neural Network (HGNN)- based QLDPC decoder that captures higher-order stabilizer constraints by utilizing hyperedges-thus enabling highly expressive and compact decoding. We use a two-stage message passing scheme and evaluate the decoder over the pseudo-threshold region. Below the pseudo-threshold mark, HyperNQ improves the Logical Error Rate (LER) up to 84% over BP and 50% over GNN-based strategies, demonstrating enhanced performance over the existing state-of-the-art decoders.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, Submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2026).

Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy.

As more and more users move towards cloud computing, it has become a critical issue to unleash the power of GNNs while protecting the privacy in cloud environments. Specifically, the training data and inference data for GNNs need to be protected from being stolen by external adversaries. Meanwhile, the financial cost of cloud computing is another primary concern for users. Therefore, although existing studies have proposed privacy-preserving techniques for GNNs in cloud environments, their additional computational and communication overhead remain relatively high, causing high financial costs that limit their widespread adoption among users. To protect GNN privacy while lowering the additional financial costs, we introduce Panther, a cost-effective privacy-preserving framework for GNN training and inference services in cloud environments. Technically, Panther leverages four-party computation to asynchronously executing the secure array access protocol, and randomly pads the neighbor information of GNN nodes. We prove that Panther can protect privacy for both training and inference of GNN models. Our evaluation shows that Panther reduces the training and inference time by an average of 75.28% and 82.80%, respectively, and communication overhead by an average of 52.61% and 50.26% compared with the state-of-the-art, which is estimated to save an average of 55.05% and 59.00% in financial costs (based on on-demand pricing model) for the GNN training and inference process on Google Cloud Platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Services Computing (TSC)</p></details> |

However, its network structure evolves dynamically under the influence of geopolitical, economic, and environmental factors, making it challenging to model and predict future trade links. Effectively capturing temporal patterns in food trade networks is therefore essential for improving the accuracy and robustness of link prediction. This study introduces IVGAE-TAMA-BO, a novel dynamic graph neural network designed to model evolving trade structures and predict future links in global food trade networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply dynamic graph neural networks to this domain, significantly enhancing predictive performance. Building upon the original IVGAE framework, the proposed model incorporates a Trade-Aware Momentum Aggregator (TAMA) to capture the temporal evolution of trade networks, jointly modeling short-term fluctuations and long-term structural dependencies. A momentum-based structural memory mechanism further improves predictive stability and performance. In addition, Bayesian optimization is used to automatically tune key hyperparameters, enhancing generalization across diverse trade scenarios. Extensive experiments on five crop-specific datasets demonstrate that IVGAE-TAMA substantially outperforms the static IVGAE and other dynamic baselines by effectively modeling temporal dependencies, while Bayesian optimization further boosts performance in IVGAE-TAMA-BO. These results highlight the proposed framework as a robust and scalable solution for structural prediction in global trade networks, with strong potential for applications in food security monitoring and policy decision support.</p></details> | 26pages,6figures |

However, their expressiveness ability is limited by: (1) Existing methods often overlook the over-smoothing issue caused by traditional GNN models, as well as the gradient explosion or vanishing problems in deep GNNs. (2) Most models operate on first-order information, neglecting that the real world often consists of second-order systems, which further limits the model's representation capabilities. To address these issues, we propose the \textbf{Du}al \textbf{S}econd-order \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}rdinary Differential Equation (\method{}) for equivariant representation. Specifically, \method{} apply the dual second-order equivariant graph ordinary differential equations (Graph ODEs) on graph embeddings and node coordinates, simultaneously. Theoretically, we first prove that \method{} maintains the equivariant property. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights showing that \method{} effectively alleviates the over-smoothing problem in both feature representation and coordinate update. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed \method{} mitigates the exploding and vanishing gradients problem, facilitating the training of deep multi-layer GNNs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed \method{} compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |

Although multi-scale Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) hold potential for modeling these relationships, they frequently neglect two key points: the subtle intra-attribute patterns within each stock affecting inter-stock correlation, and the biased attention to coarse- and fine-grained features during multi-scale sampling. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MS-HGFN (Multi-Scale Hierarchical Graph Fusion Network). The model features a hierarchical GNN module that forms dynamic graphs by learning patterns from intra-attributes and features from inter-attributes over different time scales, thus comprehensively capturing spatio-temporal dependencies. Additionally, a top-down gating approach facilitates the integration of multi-scale spatio-temporal features, preserving critical coarse- and fine-grained features without too much interference. Experiments utilizing real-world datasets from U.S. and Chinese stock markets demonstrate that MS-HGFN outperforms both traditional and advanced models, yielding up to a 1.4% improvement in prediction accuracy and enhanced stability in return simulations.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm to model spatial dependencies in load data while accommodating complex non-stationarities. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework that integrates graph-based forecasting with attention mechanisms and ensemble aggregation strategies to enhance both predictive accuracy and interpretability. Several GNN architectures -- including Graph Convolutional Networks, GraphSAGE, APPNP, and Graph Attention Networks -- are systematically evaluated on synthetic, regional (France), and fine-grained (UK) datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that graph-aware models consistently outperform conventional baselines such as Feed Forward Neural Networks and foundation models like TiREX. Furthermore, attention layers provide valuable insights into evolving spatial interactions driven by meteorological and seasonal dynamics. Ensemble aggregation, particularly through bottom-up expert combination, further improves robustness under heterogeneous data conditions. Overall, the study highlights the complementarity between structural modeling, interpretability, and robustness, and discusses the trade-offs between accuracy, model complexity, and transparency in graph-based electricity load forecasting.</p></details> | 22 pages |

Among existing methods, Ollivier-Ricci curvature has been extensively studied due to its strong geometric interpretability, effectively characterizing the local geometric distribution between nodes. However, its prohibitively high computational complexity limits its applicability to large-scale graph datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a novel graph curvature measure--Effective Resistance Curvature--which quantifies the ease of message passing along graph edges using the effective resistance between node pairs, instead of the optimal transport distance. This method significantly outperforms Ollivier-Ricci curvature in computational efficiency while preserving comparable geometric expressiveness. Theoretically, we prove the low computational complexity of effective resistance curvature and establish its substitutability for Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Furthermore, extensive experiments on diverse GNN tasks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with Ollivier-Ricci curvature while drastically reducing computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

While Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) provide high-quality socioeconomic data, their spatial coverage is limited and reported coordinates are randomly displaced for privacy, further reducing their quality. We propose a graph-based approach leveraging low-dimensional AlphaEarth satellite embeddings to predict cluster-level wealth indices across Sub-Saharan Africa. By modeling spatial relations between surveyed and unlabeled locations, and by introducing a probabilistic "fuzzy label" loss to account for coordinate displacement, we improve the generalization of wealth predictions beyond existing surveys. Our experiments on 37 DHS datasets (2017-2023) show that incorporating graph structure slightly improves accuracy compared to "image-only" baselines, demonstrating the potential of compact EO embeddings for large-scale socioeconomic mapping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Solver for CNF Placement on the Cloud-Continuum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01343v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The placement of Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNFs) across the Cloud-Continuum represents a core challenge in the orchestration of current 5G and future 6G networks. The process involves the placement of interdependent computing tasks, structured as Service Function Chains, over distributed cloud infrastructures. This is achieved while satisfying strict resource, bandwidth and latency constraints. It is acknowledged that classical approaches, including mixed-integer nonlinear programming, heuristics and reinforcement learning are limited in terms of scalability, constraint handling and generalisation capacity. In the present study, a novel theoretical framework is proposed, which is based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for CNF placement. The present approach proposes a reconceptualisation of placement as a generative graph to assignment task, where the placement problem is encoded as a heterogeneous graph, and a Graph Neural Network denoiser is trained to iteratively refine noisy CNF-to-cloud assignment matrices. The model incorporates constraint-specific losses directly into the loss function, thereby allowing it to learn feasible solution spaces. The integration of the DDPM formulation with structured combinatorial constraints is achieved through a rigorous and systematic approach. Extensive evaluations across diverse topologies have been conducted, which have confirmed that the model consistently produces feasible solutions with orders of magnitude faster inference than MINLP solvers. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of diffusion-based generative modelling for constrained network embedding problems, making an impact towards the practical, scalable orchestration of distributed Cloud-Native Network Functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Graph Neural Network-Based Semi-Supervised Open-Set Fault Diagnosis for Marine Machinery Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01258v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, fault diagnosis methods for marine machinery systems based on deep learning models have attracted considerable attention in the shipping industry. Most existing studies assume fault classes are consistent and known between the training and test datasets, and these methods perform well under controlled environment. In practice, however, previously unseen or unknown fault types (i.e., out-of-distribution or open-set observations not present during training) can occur, causing such methods to fail and posing a significant challenge to their widespread industrial deployment. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a semi-supervised open-set fault diagnosis (SOFD) framework that enhances and extends the applicability of deep learning models in open-set fault diagnosis scenarios. The framework includes a reliability subset construction process, which uses a multi-layer fusion feature representation extracted by a supervised feature learning model to select an unlabeled test subset. The labeled training set and pseudo-labeled test subset are then fed into a semi-supervised diagnosis model to learn discriminative features for each class, enabling accurate classification of known faults and effective detection of unknown samples. Experimental results on a public maritime benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SOFD framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[KAT-GNN: A Knowledge-Augmented Temporal Graph Neural Network for Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01249v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical risk prediction using electronic health records (EHRs) is vital to facilitate timely interventions and clinical decision support. However, modeling heterogeneous and irregular temporal EHR data presents significant challenges. We propose \textbf{KAT-GNN} (Knowledge-Augmented Temporal Graph Neural Network), a graph-based framework that integrates clinical knowledge and temporal dynamics for risk prediction. KAT-GNN first constructs modality-specific patient graphs from EHRs. These graphs are then augmented using two knowledge sources: (1) ontology-driven edges derived from SNOMED CT and (2) co-occurrence priors extracted from EHRs. Subsequently, a time-aware transformer is employed to capture longitudinal dynamics from the graph-encoded patient representations. KAT-GNN is evaluated on three distinct datasets and tasks: coronary artery disease (CAD) prediction using the Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD) and in-hospital mortality prediction using the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets. KAT-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD prediction (AUROC: 0.9269 $\pm$ 0.0029) and demonstrated strong results in mortality prediction in MIMIC-III (AUROC: 0.9230 $\pm$ 0.0070) and MIMIC-IV (AUROC: 0.8849 $\pm$ 0.0089), consistently outperforming established baselines such as GRASP and RETAIN. Ablation studies confirm that both knowledge-based augmentation and the temporal modeling component are significant contributors to performance gains. These findings demonstrate that the integration of clinical knowledge into graph representations, coupled with a time-aware attention mechanism, provides an effective and generalizable approach for risk prediction across diverse clinical tasks and datasets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Each LES case typically requires at least 24 hours of computation, making comprehensive parametric studies infeasible. We introduce WindMiL, a new machine learning framework that combines systematic dataset generation with symmetry-aware graph neural networks (GNNs). First, we introduce a large-scale dataset of wind loads on low-rise buildings by applying signed distance function interpolation to roof geometries and simulating 462 cases with LES across varying shapes and wind directions. Second, we develop a reflection-equivariant GNN that guarantees physically consistent predictions under mirrored geometries. Across interpolation and extrapolation evaluations, WindMiL achieves high accuracy for both the mean and the standard deviation of surface pressure coefficients (e.g., RMSE $\leq 0.02$ for mean $C_p$) and remains accurate under reflected-test evaluation, maintaining hit rates above $96\%$ where the non-equivariant baseline model drops by more than $10\%$. By pairing a systematic dataset with an equivariant surrogate, WindMiL enables efficient, scalable, and accurate predictions of wind loads on buildings.</p></details> |  |

Despite decades of research and numerous imputation methods, the literature remains fragmented across fields, creating a critical need for a comprehensive synthesis that connects statistical foundations with modern machine learning advances. This work systematically reviews core concepts-including missingness mechanisms, single versus multiple imputation, and different imputation goals-and examines problem characteristics across various domains. It provides a thorough categorization of imputation methods, spanning classical techniques (e.g., regression, the EM algorithm) to modern approaches like low-rank and high-rank matrix completion, deep learning models (autoencoders, GANs, diffusion models, graph neural networks), and large language models. Special attention is given to methods for complex data types, such as tensors, time series, streaming data, graph-structured data, categorical data, and multimodal data. Beyond methodology, we investigate the crucial integration of imputation with downstream tasks like classification, clustering, and anomaly detection, examining both sequential pipelines and joint optimization frameworks. The review also assesses theoretical guarantees, benchmarking resources, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future directions, emphasizing model selection and hyperparameter optimization, the growing importance of privacy-preserving imputation via federated learning, and the pursuit of generalizable models that can adapt across domains and data types, thereby outlining a roadmap for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information. While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that, counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Traditional retrieval methods are constrained by database coverage and quality. Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) enable direct location reasoning from image content, yet individual models struggle with diverse geographic regions and complex scenes. Existing multi-agent systems improve performance through model collaboration but treat all agent interactions uniformly. They lack mechanisms to handle conflicting predictions effectively. We propose \textbf{GraphGeo}, a multi-agent debate framework using heterogeneous graph neural networks for visual geo-localization. Our approach models diverse debate relationships through typed edges, distinguishing supportive collaboration, competitive argumentation, and knowledge transfer. We introduce a dual-level debate mechanism combining node-level refinement and edge-level argumentation modeling. A cross-level topology refinement strategy enables co-evolution between graph structure and agent representations. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate GraphGeo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our framework transforms cognitive conflicts between agents into enhanced geo-localization accuracy through structured debate.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.</p></details> |  |

To support scalability, the bandwidth allocation policy is represented by a graph neural network (GNN), with which the number of training parameters does not change with the number of users. To enable the generalization of the GNN, we develop a hybrid-task meta-learning (HML) algorithm that trains the initial parameters of the GNN with different communication scenarios during meta-training. Next, during meta-testing, a few samples are used to fine-tune the GNN with unseen communication scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our HML approach can improve the initial performance by 8.79%, and sample efficiency by 73%, compared with existing benchmarks. After fine-tuning, our near-optimal GNN-based policy can achieve close to the same reward with much lower inference complexity compared to the optimal policy obtained using iterative optimization. Numerical results validate that our HML can reduce the computation time by approximately 200 to 2000 times than the optimal iterative algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Repetition-Invariant Representations for Polymer Informatics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10726v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polymers are large macromolecules composed of repeating structural units known as monomers and are widely applied in fields such as energy storage, construction, medicine, and aerospace. However, existing graph neural network methods, though effective for small molecules, only model the single unit of polymers and fail to produce consistent vector representations for the true polymer structure with varying numbers of units. To address this challenge, we introduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer representations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their graph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree alignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and data perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal augmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning. GRIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both homopolymer and copolymer benchmarks, learning stable, repetition-invariant representations that generalize effectively to polymer chains of unseen sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, current methods often overlook the critical importance of preserving symmetry when generating scene graphs from 3D point clouds, which can lead to reduced accuracy and robustness, particularly when dealing with noisy, multi-view data. Furthermore, a major limitation of prior approaches is the lack of temporal modeling to capture time-dependent relationships among dynamically evolving entities in a scene. To address these challenges, we propose Temporal Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (TESGNN), consisting of two key components: (1) an Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (ESGNN), which extracts information from 3D point clouds to generate scene graph while preserving crucial symmetry properties, and (2) a Temporal Graph Matching Network, which fuses scene graphs generated by ESGNN across multiple time sequences into a unified global representation using an approximate graph-matching algorithm. Our combined architecture TESGNN shown to be effective compared to existing methods in scene graph generation, achieving higher accuracy and faster training convergence. Moreover, we show that leveraging the symmetry-preserving property produces a more stable and accurate global scene representation compared to existing approaches. Finally, it is computationally efficient and easily implementable using existing frameworks, making it well-suited for real-time applications in robotics and computer vision. This approach paves the way for more robust and scalable solutions to complex multi-view scene understanding challenges.

Simple Architectures Meet Excellence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09263v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often criticized for their limited expressiveness, issues like over-smoothing and over-squashing, and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies. Conversely, Graph Transformers (GTs) are regarded as superior due to their employment of global attention mechanisms, which potentially mitigate these challenges. Literature frequently suggests that GTs outperform GNNs in graph-level tasks, especially for graph classification and regression on small molecular graphs. In this study, we explore the untapped potential of GNNs through an enhanced framework, GNN+, which integrates six widely used techniques: edge feature integration, normalization, dropout, residual connections, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding, to effectively tackle graph-level tasks. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of three classic GNNs (GCN, GIN, and GatedGCN) enhanced by the GNN+ framework across 14 well-known graph-level datasets. Our results reveal that, contrary to prevailing beliefs, these classic GNNs consistently match or surpass the performance of GTs, securing top-three rankings across all datasets and achieving first place in eight. Furthermore, they demonstrate greater efficiency, running several times faster than GTs on many datasets. This highlights the potential of simple GNN architectures, challenging the notion that complex mechanisms in GTs are essential for superior graph-level performance.

The problem is challenging in decentralized settings with robots that have limited communication and sensing capabilities. We propose a learnable Perception-Action-Communication (LPAC) architecture for the problem, wherein a convolutional neural network (CNN) processes localized perception; a graph neural network (GNN) facilitates robot communications; finally, a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) computes robot actions. The GNN enables collaboration in the robot swarm by computing what information to communicate with nearby robots and how to incorporate received information. Evaluations show that the LPAC models -- trained using imitation learning -- outperform standard decentralized and centralized coverage control algorithms. The learned policy generalizes to environments different from the training dataset, transfers to larger environments with more robots, and is robust to noisy position estimates. The results indicate the suitability of LPAC architectures for decentralized navigation in robot swarms to achieve collaborative behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, 20 figures,</p></details> |
| **[Learning Sparse Approximate Inverse Preconditioners for Conjugate Gradient Solvers on GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27517v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conjugate gradient solver (CG) is a prevalent method for solving symmetric and positive definite linear systems Ax=b, where effective preconditioners are crucial for fast convergence. Traditional preconditioners rely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while limiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing learning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve the performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on incomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated triangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces long-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these issues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly preconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate Inverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires only two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector product is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The flexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss function. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on the condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved performance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms standard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous learning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by 40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior generalization performance.

While Graph Neural Networks, particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network, a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation. The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and clear advantages of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the learning task at the expense of discarding fundamental graph structures, thus reducing interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across dataset types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we propose novel graph pooling layers for structure-aware pooling via edge collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and its structural diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process. Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods (i) achieve top performance compared to alternative pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii) preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high accuracy across varying pooling ratios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025.

| **[Multi-Modal Feature Fusion for Spatial Morphology Analysis of Traditional Villages via Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27208v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83 (independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and generative logic.</p></details> |  |

Traditional accident prediction models treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety, infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design, enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development projects.</p></details> |  |

A common approach, popularized by ChebyNet, is to use polynomial filters based on continuous orthogonal polynomials (e.g., Chebyshev). This creates a theoretical disconnect, as these continuous-domain filters are applied to inherently discrete graph structures. We hypothesize this mismatch can lead to suboptimal performance and fragility to hyperparameter settings. In this paper, we introduce MeixnerNet, a novel spectral GNN architecture that employs discrete orthogonal polynomials -- specifically, the Meixner polynomials $M_k(x; \beta, c)$. Our model makes the two key shape parameters of the polynomial, beta and c, learnable, allowing the filter to adapt its polynomial basis to the specific spectral properties of a given graph. We overcome the significant numerical instability of these polynomials by introducing a novel stabilization technique that combines Laplacian scaling with per-basis LayerNorm. We demonstrate experimentally that MeixnerNet achieves competitive-to-superior performance against the strong ChebyNet baseline at the optimal K = 2 setting (winning on 2 out of 3 benchmarks). More critically, we show that MeixnerNet is exceptionally robust to variations in the polynomial degree K, a hyperparameter to which ChebyNet proves to be highly fragile, collapsing in performance where MeixnerNet remains stable.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often fail to effectively capture complex spatial-temporal dependencies in large-scale road networks, especially under the influence of external factors such as weather, holidays, and traffic accidents. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a cloud-based hybrid model that integrates Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with a Transformer architecture for traffic flow prediction. The model leverages the strengths of GNNs in modeling spatial correlations across road networks and the Transformers' ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies. External contextual features are incorporated via feature fusion to enhance predictive accuracy. The proposed model is deployed on a cloud computing platform to achieve scalability and real-time adaptability. Experimental evaluation of the dataset shows that our model outperforms baseline methods (LSTM, TCN, GCN, pure Transformer) with an RMSE of only 17.92 and a MAE of only 10.53. These findings suggest that the hybrid GNN-Transformer approach provides an effective and scalable solution for cloud-based ITS applications, offering methodological advancements for traffic flow forecasting and practical implications for congestion mitigation.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a variational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to embeddings that represent their coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric graph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to distances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is solved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this data-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline. We show that, under uniform sampling from $\mathcal{M}$, the generalization gap of the semi-supervised task diminishes with increasing graph size, up to the GNN training error. Leveraging a training procedure which resamples a slightly larger graph at regular intervals during training, we then show that the generalization gap can be reduced even further, vanishing asymptotically. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

Existing methods to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases, and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable, data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

Besides working well in practical settings, their ability to generalize beyond the training set remains poorly understood. While some studies have explored MPNNs' generalization in graph-level prediction tasks, much less attention has been given to node- and link-level predictions. Existing works often rely on unrealistic i.i.d.\@ assumptions, overlooking possible correlations between nodes or links, and assuming fixed aggregation and impractical loss functions while neglecting the influence of graph structure. In this work, we introduce a unified framework to analyze the generalization properties of MPNNs in inductive and transductive node and link prediction settings, incorporating diverse architectural parameters and loss functions and quantifying the influence of graph structure. Additionally, our proposed generalization framework can be applied beyond graphs to any classification task under the inductive or transductive setting. Our empirical study supports our theoretical insights, deepening our understanding of MPNNs' generalization capabilities in these tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.07106</p></details> |
| **[UnifiedFL: A Dynamic Unified Learning Framework for Equitable Federation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26350v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology. However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs), still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g., CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time, undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures, have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains, current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy balancing convergence and diversity.

However, non-uniform interactions and random topologies make this task challenging. We address these challenges by proposing \textit{Graph Controllable Embeddings} (GCE), a general framework to learn stochastic multi-object dynamics for linear control. Specifically, GCE is built on Hilbert space embeddings, allowing direct embedding of probability distributions of controlled stochastic dynamics into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which enables linear operations in its RKHS while retaining nonlinear expressiveness. We provide theoretical guarantees on the existence, convergence, and applicability of GCE. Notably, a mean field approximation technique is adopted to efficiently capture inter-object dependencies and achieve provably low sample complexity. By integrating graph neural networks, we construct data-dependent kernel features that are capable of adapting to dynamic interaction patterns and generalizing to even unseen topologies with only limited training instances. GCE scales seamlessly to multi-object systems of varying sizes and topologies. Leveraging the linearity of Hilbert spaces, GCE also supports simple yet effective control algorithms for synthesizing optimal sequences. Experiments on physical systems, robotics, and power grids validate GCE and demonstrate consistent performance improvement over various competitive embedding methods in both in-distribution and few-shot tests</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Cybersecurity Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26307v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a critical task in cybersecurity, where identifying insider threats, access violations, and coordinated attacks is essential for ensuring system resilience. Graph-based approaches have become increasingly important for modeling entity interactions, yet most rely on homogeneous and static structures, which limits their ability to capture the heterogeneity and temporal evolution of real-world environments. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for anomaly detection by incorporating type-aware transformations and relation-sensitive aggregation, enabling more expressive modeling of complex cyber data. However, current research on HGNN-based anomaly detection remains fragmented, with diverse modeling strategies, limited comparative evaluation, and an absence of standardized benchmarks. To address this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey of HGNN-based anomaly detection methods in cybersecurity. We introduce a taxonomy that classifies approaches by anomaly type and graph dynamics, analyze representative models, and map them to key cybersecurity applications. We also review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Finally, we identify key open challenges related to modeling, data, and deployment, and outline promising directions for future research. This survey aims to establish a structured foundation for advancing HGNN-based anomaly detection toward scalable, interpretable, and practically deployable solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 4 figures, 86 references.

| **[Morphology-Aware Graph Reinforcement Learning for Tensegrity Robot Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26067v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensegrity robots combine rigid rods and elastic cables, offering high resilience and deployability but posing major challenges for locomotion control due to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. This paper introduces a morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By representing the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based policy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable learning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion primitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It shows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations, and improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer directly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable real-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of incorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity robot control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-driven Projection Generation for Efficiently Solving Heterogeneous Quadratic Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26061v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a data-driven framework for efficiently solving quadratic programming (QP) problems by reducing the number of variables in high-dimensional QPs using instance-specific projection. A graph neural network-based model is designed to generate projections tailored to each QP instance, enabling us to produce high-quality solutions even for previously unseen problems. The model is trained on heterogeneous QPs to minimize the expected objective value evaluated on the projected solutions. This is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem; the inner optimization solves the QP under a given projection using a QP solver, while the outer optimization updates the model parameters. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this bilevel optimization problem, which computes parameter gradients without backpropagating through the solver. We provide a theoretical analysis of the generalization ability of solving QPs with projection matrices generated by neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces high-quality feasible solutions with reduced computation time, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Graph Networks for Accurate Weather Forecasting via Lightweight Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22094v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure. Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends, weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in the supplementary materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fixed-point graph convolutional networks against adversarial attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00083v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks present a significant risk to the integrity and performance of graph neural networks, particularly in tasks where graph structure and node features are vulnerable to manipulation. In this paper, we present a novel model, called fixed-point iterative graph convolutional network (Fix-GCN), which achieves robustness against adversarial perturbations by effectively capturing higher-order node neighborhood information in the graph without additional memory or computational complexity. Specifically, we introduce a versatile spectral modulation filter and derive the feature propagation rule of our model using fixed-point iteration. Unlike traditional defense mechanisms that rely on additional design elements to counteract attacks, the proposed graph filter provides a flexible-pass filtering approach, allowing it to selectively attenuate high-frequency components while preserving low-frequency structural information in the graph signal. By iteratively updating node representations, our model offers a flexible and efficient framework for preserving essential graph information while mitigating the impact of adversarial manipulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model through extensive experiments on various benchmark graph datasets, showcasing its resilience against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust GNN Watermarking via Implicit Perception of Topological Invariants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25934v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free, black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss (KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness, and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Network-based Structural Simulator: Graph Neural Networks for Structural Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25683v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate modeling of dynamic structural problems. GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss, which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction. We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful predictions. Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated structural simulations.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |
| **[A method for the systematic generation of graph XAI benchmarks via Weisfeiler-Leman coloring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12437v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have become the de facto model for learning from structured data. However, the decision-making process of GNNs remains opaque to the end user, which undermines their use in safety-critical applications. Several explainable AI techniques for graphs have been developed to address this major issue. Focusing on graph classification, these explainers identify subgraph motifs that explain predictions. Therefore, a robust benchmarking of graph explainers is required to ensure that the produced explanations are of high quality, i.e., aligned with the GNN's decision process. However, current graph-XAI benchmarks are limited to simplistic synthetic datasets or a few real-world tasks curated by domain experts, hindering rigorous and reproducible evaluation, and consequently stalling progress in the field. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method to automate the construction of graph XAI benchmarks from generic graph classification datasets. Our approach leverages the Weisfeiler-Leman color refinement algorithm to efficiently perform approximate subgraph matching and mine class-discriminating motifs, which serve as proxy ground-truth class explanations. At the same time, we ensure that these motifs can be learned by GNNs because their discriminating power aligns with WL expressiveness. This work also introduces the OpenGraphXAI benchmark suite, which consists of 15 ready-made graph-XAI datasets derived by applying our method to real-world molecular classification datasets. The suite is available to the public along with a codebase to generate over 2,000 additional graph-XAI benchmarks. Finally, we present a use case that illustrates how the suite can be used to assess the effectiveness of a selection of popular graph explainers, demonstrating the critical role of a sufficiently large benchmark collection for improving the significance of experimental results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring End-to-end Differentiable Neural Charged Particle Tracking -- A Loss Landscape Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13420v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measurement and analysis of high energetic particles for scientific, medical or industrial applications is a complex procedure, requiring the design of sophisticated detector and data processing systems. The development of adaptive and differentiable software pipelines using a combination of conventional and machine learning algorithms is therefore getting ever more important to optimize and operate the system efficiently while maintaining end-to-end (E2E) differentiability. We propose for the application of charged particle tracking an E2E differentiable decision-focused learning scheme using graph neural networks with combinatorial components solving a linear assignment problem for each detector layer. We demonstrate empirically that including differentiable variations of discrete assignment operations allows for efficient network optimization, working better or on par with approaches that lack E2E differentiability. In additional studies, we dive deeper into the optimization process and provide further insights from a loss landscape perspective. We demonstrate that while both methods converge into similar performing, globally well-connected regions, they suffer under substantial predictive instability across initialization and optimization methods, which can have unpredictable consequences on the performance of downstream tasks such as image reconstruction. We also point out a dependency between the interpolation factor of the gradient estimator and the prediction stability of the model, suggesting the choice of sufficiently small values. Given the strong global connectivity of learned solutions and the excellent training performance, we argue that E2E differentiability provides, besides the general availability of gradient information, an important tool for robust particle tracking to mitigate prediction instabilities by favoring solutions that perform well on downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2025</p></details> |

While local explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation methods, those that characterize an entire class, remain underdeveloped. Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space, exemplars, and explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem over reverse k-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study with 60 participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 20 figures, NeurIPS 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Most existing approaches often require long training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss, that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality, while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds.

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods like low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are efficient but lack flexibility, while Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enhance model capacity at the cost of more & under-utilized parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Structural Mixture of Residual Experts (S'MoRE), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the efficiency of LoRA with the flexibility of MoE. Conceptually, S'MoRE employs hierarchical low-rank decomposition of expert weights, yielding residuals of varying orders interconnected in a multi-layer structure. By routing input tokens through sub-trees of residuals, S'MoRE emulates the capacity of numerous experts by instantiating and assembling just a few low-rank matrices. We craft the inter-layer propagation of S'MoRE's residuals as a special type of Graph Neural Network (GNN), and prove that under similar parameter budget, S'MoRE improves structural flexibility of traditional MoE (or Mixture-of-LoRA) by exponential order. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that S'MoRE achieves superior fine-tuning performance, offering a transformative approach for efficient LLM adaptation. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/ZimpleX/SMoRE-LLM.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Many real-world graphs exceed the memory capacity of a GPU due to their sheer size, and training GNNs on such graphs requires techniques such as mini-batch sampling to scale. The alternative approach of distributed full-graph training suffers from high communication overheads and load imbalance due to the irregular structure of graphs. We propose a three-dimensional (3D) parallel approach for full-graph training that tackles these issues and scales to billion-edge graphs. In addition, we introduce optimizations such as a double permutation scheme for load balancing, and a performance model to predict the optimal 3D configuration of our parallel implementation -- Plexus. We evaluate Plexus on six different graph datasets and show scaling results on up to 2048 GPUs of Perlmutter, and 1024 GPUs of Frontier. Plexus achieves unprecedented speedups of 2.3-12.5x over prior state of the art, and a reduction in time-to-solution by 5.2-8.7x on Perlmutter and 7.0-54.2x on Frontier.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging the comprehensive UNSW-NB15 dataset containing diverse network traffic patterns, our approach effectively captures both spatial dependencies through graph structural relationships and temporal dynamics through sequential analysis of network events. The integrated attention mechanism provides dual benefits of improved model interpretability and enhanced feature selection, enabling cybersecurity analysts to focus computational resources on high-impact security events -- a critical requirement in modern real-time intrusion detection systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model achieves superior performance compared to traditional machine learning approaches and standalone deep learning models across multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model achieves particularly strong performance in detecting sophisticated attack patterns such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and zero-day exploits, making it a promising solution for next-generation cybersecurity applications in complex network environments.</p></details> |  |

Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a novel approach toward high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5% validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super explosives higher than 9 km/s predicted detonation velocity.</p></details> |  |

Conventional numerical approaches, including Finite Element Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, provide high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive for iterative optimization tasks, as each evaluation requires solving the governing equations for every parameter combination. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven framework that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) surrogate model with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizer to overcome these challenges. The GNN is trained to accurately learn the nonlinear mapping between structural parameters and dynamic displacement responses, enabling rapid predictions without repeatedly solving the system equations. A dataset of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system responses is generated using the Newmark Beta method across diverse mass, stiffness, and damping configurations. The GA then searches for globally optimal parameter sets by minimizing predicted displacements and enhancing dynamic stability. Results demonstrate that the GNN and GA framework achieves strong convergence, robust generalization, and significantly reduced computational cost compared to conventional simulations. This approach highlights the effectiveness of combining machine learning surrogates with evolutionary optimization for automated and intelligent structural design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Extensive experiments on both ERA5 and MERRA-2 reanalysis datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and recent deep learning methods. Quantitative evaluations and visual analyses in Beijing and Shanghai confirm the model's capability to capture fine-grained meteorological patterns. The proposed framework provides a scalable and label-efficient solution for future data-driven weather forecasting systems.</p></details> |  |

Although Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are widely used for financial fraud detection, graph Transformer models such as Graph-BERT are gaining prominence due to their Transformer-based architecture, which mitigates issues such as over-smoothing. Graph-BERT is designed for static graphs and primarily evaluated on citation networks with undirected edges. However, financial transaction networks are inherently dynamic, with evolving structures and directed edges representing the flow of money. To address these challenges, we introduce DynBERG, a novel architecture that integrates Graph-BERT with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer to capture temporal evolution over multiple time steps. Additionally, we modify the underlying algorithm to support directed edges, making DynBERG well-suited for dynamic financial transaction analysis. We evaluate our model on the Elliptic dataset, which includes Bitcoin transactions, including all transactions during a major cryptocurrency market event, the Dark Market Shutdown. By assessing DynBERG's resilience before and after this event, we analyse its ability to adapt to significant market shifts that impact transaction behaviours. Our model is benchmarked against state-of-the-art dynamic graph classification approaches, such as EvolveGCN and GCN, demonstrating superior performance, outperforming EvolveGCN before the market shutdown and surpassing GCN after the event. Additionally, an ablation study highlights the critical role of incorporating a time-series deep learning component, showcasing the effectiveness of GRU in modelling the temporal dynamics of financial transactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAGNET: A Multi-Graph Attentional Network for Code Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24241v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code clone detection is a fundamental task in software engineering that underpins refactoring, debugging, plagiarism detection, and vulnerability analysis. Existing methods often rely on singular representations such as abstract syntax trees (ASTs), control flow graphs (CFGs), and data flow graphs (DFGs), which capture only partial aspects of code semantics. Hybrid approaches have emerged, but their fusion strategies are typically handcrafted and ineffective. In this study, we propose MAGNET, a multi-graph attentional framework that jointly leverages AST, CFG, and DFG representations to capture syntactic and semantic features of source code. MAGNET integrates residual graph neural networks with node-level self-attention to learn both local and long-range dependencies, introduces a gated cross-attention mechanism for fine-grained inter-graph interactions, and employs Set2Set pooling to fuse multi-graph embeddings into unified program-level representations. Extensive experiments on BigCloneBench and Google Code Jam demonstrate that MAGNET achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall F1 score of 96.5\% and 99.2\% on the two datasets, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of multi-graph fusion and each attentional component. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZixianReid/Multigraph_match</p></details> |  |

As the capabilities of basic architectures are becoming well understood, increasing attention is turning to models that combine multiple architectural paradigms. Among them particularly important, and challenging to analyse, are temporal extensions of GNNs, which integrate both spatial (graph-structure) and temporal (evolution over time) dimensions. In this paper, we initiate the study of logical characterisation of temporal GNNs by connecting them to two-dimensional product logics. We show that the expressive power of temporal GNNs depends on how graph and temporal components are combined. In particular, temporal GNNs that apply static GNNs recursively over time can capture all properties definable in the product logic of (past) propositional temporal logic PTL and the modal logic K. In contrast, architectures such as graph-and-time TGNNs and global TGNNs can only express restricted fragments of this logic, where the interaction between temporal and spatial operators is syntactically constrained. These provide us with the first results on the logical expressiveness of temporal GNNs.</p></details> |  |

As a UNESCO-recognized intangible cultural heritage, Nanyin follows a heterophonic tradition centered around the pipa, where core melodies are notated in traditional notation while ornamentations are passed down orally, presenting challenges for both preservation and contemporary innovation. To address this, we construct a Pipa-Centric MIDI dataset, develop NanyinTok as a specialized tokenization method, and convert symbolic sequences into graph structures using a Graph Converter to ensure that key musical features are preserved. Our key innovation reformulates ornamentation generation as the creation of ornamentation nodes within a heterogeneous graph. First, a graph neural network generates melodic outlines optimized for ornamentations. Then, a rule-guided system informed by Nanyin performance practices refines these outlines into complete ornamentations without requiring explicit ornamentation annotations during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our model successfully generates authentic heterophonic ensembles featuring four traditional instruments. These findings validate that integrating domain-specific knowledge into model architecture can effectively mitigate data scarcity challenges in computational ethnomusicology.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity -- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power often comes at the cost of generalization.</p></details> |  |

We introduce FALCON, a unified machine learning framework that enables fully automated, specification-driven analog circuit synthesis through topology selection and layout-constrained optimization. Given a target performance, FALCON first selects an appropriate circuit topology using a performance-driven classifier guided by human design heuristics. Next, it employs a custom, edge-centric graph neural network trained to map circuit topology and parameters to performance, enabling gradient-based parameter inference through the learned forward model. This inference is guided by a differentiable layout cost, derived from analytical equations capturing parasitic and frequency-dependent effects, and constrained by design rules. We train and evaluate FALCON on a large-scale custom dataset of 1M analog mm-wave circuits, generated and simulated using Cadence Spectre across 20 expert-designed topologies. Through this evaluation, FALCON demonstrates >99% accuracy in topology inference, <10% relative error in performance prediction, and efficient layout-aware design that completes in under 1 second per instance. Together, these results position FALCON as a practical and extensible foundation model for end-to-end analog circuit design automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

Building on the Bayesian decision-theoretic framework of Sablayrolles et al., we derive the Bayes-optimal membership inference rule for node-level MIAs against graph neural networks, addressing key open questions about optimal query strategies in the graph setting. We introduce BASE and G-BASE, tractable approximations of the Bayes-optimal membership inference. G-BASE achieves superior performance compared to previously proposed classifier-based node-level MIA attacks. BASE, which is also applicable to non-graph data, matches or exceeds the performance of prior state-of-the-art MIAs, such as LiRA and RMIA, at a significantly lower computational cost. Finally, we show that BASE and RMIA are equivalent under a specific hyperparameter setting, providing a principled, Bayes-optimal justification for the RMIA attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Ne...</summary><p>In NeurIPS 2025, 10 pages plus 15 pages of appendices</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Graph Neural Networks: A Mutual Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19223v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, a wide range of solutions have been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning, including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture, and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires models to go beyond path-based reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at NeurIPS 2025 D&B track</p></details> |

This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages, including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac, exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods. Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification, particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships among visual entities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of ICONIP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Dual Prompting: Hierarchical Debiasing for Fairness-aware Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23469v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through self-supervised learning on unlabeled graph data has emerged as a widely adopted paradigm in graph learning. Although the paradigm is effective for pre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable prompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph prompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks, they often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In fact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations across demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains biases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we propose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute bias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized attribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer, reducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message Calibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust the message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of the information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting modules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to evaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed ADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a MetaModel framework to aggregate predictions from a diverse set of leading ML models. We present a featurisation scheme for combining task-specific GNN-derived features with conventional molecular descriptors. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the cutting-edge ChemProp model on all regression datasets tested and 6 of 9 classification datasets. We further show that including the GNN features derived from ChemProp boosts the ensemble model's performance on several datasets where it otherwise would have underperformed. We conclude that to achieve optimal performance across a wide set of problems, it is vital to combine general-purpose descriptors with task-specific learned features and use a diverse set of ML models to make the predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOPSE: Scalable Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder for Combinatorial Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15405v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective at modeling relational data, pairwise connections cannot fully capture multi-way relationships naturally present in complex real-world systems. In response to this, Topological Deep Learning (TDL) leverages more general combinatorial representations -- such as simplicial or cellular complexes -- to accommodate higher-order interactions. Existing TDL methods often extend GNNs through Higher-Order Message Passing (HOMP), but face critical \emph{scalability challenges} due to \textit{(i)} a combinatorial explosion of message-passing routes, and \textit{(ii)} significant complexity overhead from the propagation mechanism. This work presents HOPSE (Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder), an alternative method to solve tasks involving higher-order interactions \emph{without message passing}. Instead, HOPSE breaks \emph{arbitrary higher-order domains} into their neighborhood relationships using a Hasse graph decomposition. This method shows that decoupling the representation learning of neighborhood topology from that of attributes results in lower computational complexity, casting doubt on the need for HOMP. The experiments on molecular graph tasks and topological benchmarks show that HOPSE matches performance on traditional TDL datasets and outperforms HOMP methods on topological tasks, achieving up to $7\times$ speedups over HOMP-based models, opening a new path for scalable TDL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Transformation Invariant Geometric Deep Learning: An Initial Representation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12345v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have achieved great success in the last decade. When designing neural networks to handle the ubiquitous geometric data such as point clouds and graphs, it is critical that the model can maintain invariance towards various transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling. Most existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches can only maintain permutation-invariance, failing to guarantee invariance with respect to other transformations. Besides GNNs, other works design sophisticated transformation-invariant layers, which are computationally expensive and difficult to be extended. In this paper, we revisit why general neural networks cannot maintain transformation invariance. Our findings show that transformation-invariant and distance-preserving initial point representations are sufficient to achieve transformation invariance rather than needing sophisticated neural layer designs. Motivated by these findings, we propose Transformation Invariant Neural Networks (TinvNN), a straightforward and general plug-in for geometric data. Specifically, we realize transformation invariant and distance-preserving initial point representations by modifying multi-dimensional scaling and feed the representations into existing neural networks. We prove that TinvNN can strictly guarantee transformation invariance, being general and flexible enough to be combined with the existing neural networks. Extensive experimental results on point cloud analysis and combinatorial optimization demonstrate the effectiveness and general applicability of our method. We also extend our method into equivariance cases. Based on the results, we advocate that TinvNN should be considered as an essential baseline for further studies of transformation-invariant geometric deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages; accepted by IEEE TPAMI</p></details> |

We investigate the underappreciated potential of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding, particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Cross-Lingual Sponsored Search via Dual-Encoder and Graph Neural Networks for Context-Aware Query Translation in Advertising Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22957v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-lingual sponsored search is crucial for global advertising platforms, where users from different language backgrounds interact with multilingual ads. Traditional machine translation methods often fail to capture query-specific contextual cues, leading to semantic ambiguities that negatively impact click-through rates (CTR) and conversion rates (CVR). To address this challenge, we propose AdGraphTrans, a novel dual-encoder framework enhanced with graph neural networks (GNNs) for context-aware query translation in advertising. Specifically, user queries and ad contents are independently encoded using multilingual Transformer-based encoders (mBERT/XLM-R), and contextual relations-such as co-clicked ads, user search sessions, and query-ad co-occurrence-are modeled as a heterogeneous graph. A graph attention network (GAT) is then applied to refine embeddings by leveraging semantic and behavioral context. These embeddings are aligned via contrastive learning to reduce translation ambiguity. Experiments conducted on a cross-lingual sponsored search dataset collected from Google Ads and Amazon Ads (EN-ZH, EN-ES, EN-FR pairs) demonstrate that AdGraphTrans significantly improves query translation quality, achieving a BLEU score of 38.9 and semantic similarity (cosine score) of 0.83, outperforming strong baselines such as mBERT and M2M-100. Moreover, in downstream ad retrieval tasks, AdGraphTrans yields +4.67% CTR and +1.72% CVR improvements over baseline methods. These results confirm that incorporating graph-based contextual signals with dual-encoder translation provides a robust solution for enhancing cross-lingual sponsored search in advertising platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid GNN-IZR Framework for Fast and Empirically Robust AC Power Flow Analysis in Radial Distribution Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04264v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Alternating Current Power Flow (ACPF) problem forces a trade-off between the speed of data-driven models and the reliability of analytical solvers. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that synergizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with the Implicit Z-Bus Recursive (IZR) method, a robust, non-iterative solver for radial distribution networks. The framework employs a physics-informed GNN for rapid initial predictions and invokes the IZR solver as a failsafe for stressed cases identified by a two-stage trigger. A failure is defined as any solution with a maximum power mismatch exceeding 0.1 p.u., a significant operational deviation. On a challenging test set of 7,500 stressed scenarios for the IEEE 33-bus system, the GNN-only model failed on 13.11 % of cases. In contrast, the hybrid framework identified all potential failures, delegating them to the IZR solver to achieve a 0.00 % failure rate, empirically matching the 100 % success rate of the analytical solver on this specific test set. An expanded ablation study confirms that both physics-informed training and Z-bus sensitivity features are critical, collaboratively reducing the GNN's failure rate from 98.72 % (data-only) to 13.11 %. The hybrid approach demonstrates a pragmatic path to achieving the empirical reliability of an analytical solver while leveraging GNN speed, enabling a significant increase in the number of scenarios analyzable in near real-time.</p></details> |  |

Existing POI recommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and sequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a fundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts of user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose GTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing. GTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces for different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in hyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel Mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent space. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses spatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM), enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables, submitted to ICDE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Diffuse to Detect: A Generalizable Framework for Anomaly Detection with Diffusion Models Applications to UAVs and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22928v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data, such as UAV sensor readings, is essential for operational safety but challenging for existing methods due to their limited sensitivity, scalability, and inability to capture intricate dependencies. We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection, diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability, provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency. Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policies over Poses: Reinforcement Learning based Distributed Pose-Graph Optimization for Multi-Robot SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22740v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the distributed pose-graph optimization (PGO) problem, which is fundamental in accurate trajectory estimation in multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Conventional iterative approaches linearize a highly non-convex optimization objective, requiring repeated solving of normal equations, which often converge to local minima and thus produce suboptimal estimates. We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO framework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed PGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where each action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner decomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent edge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating to denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid policy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local graph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to produce a globally consistent estimate. Our extensive evaluations on a comprehensive suite of synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our learned MARL-based actors reduce the global objective by an average of 37.5% more than the state-of-the-art distributed PGO framework, while enhancing inference efficiency by at least 6X. We also demonstrate that actor replication allows a single learned policy to scale effortlessly to substantially larger robot teams without any retraining.

For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets.

While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness. We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum, average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.
