| **[TA-KAND: Two-stage Attention Triple Enhancement and U-KAN based Diffusion For Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12182v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graphs have become fundamental infrastructure for applications such as intelligent question answering and recommender systems due to their expressive representation. Nevertheless, real-world knowledge is heterogeneous, leading to a pronounced long-tailed distribution over relations. Previous studies mainly based on metric matching or meta learning. However, they often overlook the distributional characteristics of positive and negative triple samples. In this paper, we propose a few-shot knowledge graph completion framework that integrates two-stage attention triple enhancer with U-KAN based diffusion model. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show significant advantages of our methods.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[N$^2$: A Unified Python Package and Test Bench for Nearest Neighbor-Based Matrix Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04166v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nearest neighbor (NN) methods have re-emerged as competitive tools for matrix completion, offering strong empirical performance and recent theoretical guarantees, including entry-wise error bounds, confidence intervals, and minimax optimality. Despite their simplicity, recent work has shown that NN approaches are robust to a range of missingness patterns and effective across diverse applications. This paper introduces N$^2$, a unified Python package and testbed that consolidates a broad class of NN-based methods through a modular, extensible interface. Built for both researchers and practitioners, N$^2$ supports rapid experimentation and benchmarking. Using this framework, we introduce a new NN variant that achieves state-of-the-art results in several settings. We also release a benchmark suite of real-world datasets, from healthcare and recommender systems to causal inference and LLM evaluation, designed to stress-test matrix completion methods beyond synthetic scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that while classical methods excel on idealized data, NN-based techniques consistently outperform them in real-world settings.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |
| **[RGAlign-Rec: Ranking-Guided Alignment for Latent Query Reasoning in Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12968v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proactive intent prediction is a critical capability in modern e-commerce chatbots, enabling "zero-query" recommendations by anticipating user needs from behavioral and contextual signals. However, existing industrial systems face two fundamental challenges: (1) the semantic gap between discrete user features and the semantic intents within the chatbot's Knowledge Base, and (2) the objective misalignment between general-purpose LLM outputs and task-specific ranking utilities. To address these issues, we propose RGAlign-Rec, a closed-loop alignment framework that integrates an LLM-based semantic reasoner with a Query-Enhanced (QE) ranking model. We also introduce Ranking-Guided Alignment (RGA), a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes downstream ranking signals as feedback to refine the LLM's latent reasoning. Extensive experiments on a large-scale industrial dataset from Shopee demonstrate that RGAlign-Rec achieves a 0.12% gain in GAUC, leading to a significant 3.52% relative reduction in error rate, and a 0.56% improvement in Recall@3. Online A/B testing further validates the cumulative effectiveness of our framework: the Query-Enhanced model (QE-Rec) initially yields a 0.98% improvement in CTR, while the subsequent Ranking-Guided Alignment stage contributes an additional 0.13% gain. These results indicate that ranking-aware alignment effectively synchronizes semantic reasoning with ranking objectives, significantly enhancing both prediction accuracy and service quality in real-world proactive recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTFM: A Scalable and Alignment-free Foundation Model for Industrial Recommendation in Meituan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11235v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial recommendation systems typically involve multiple scenarios, yet existing cross-domain (CDR) and multi-scenario (MSR) methods often require prohibitive resources and strict input alignment, limiting their extensibility. We propose MTFM (Meituan Foundation Model for Recommendation), a transformer-based framework that addresses these challenges. Instead of pre-aligning inputs, MTFM transforms cross-domain data into heterogeneous tokens, capturing multi-scenario knowledge in an alignment-free manner. To enhance efficiency, we first introduce a multi-scenario user-level sample aggregation that significantly enhances training throughput by reducing the total number of instances. We further integrate Grouped-Query Attention and a customized Hybrid Target Attention to minimize memory usage and computational complexity. Furthermore, we implement various system-level optimizations, such as kernel fusion and the elimination of CPU-GPU blocking, to further enhance both training and inference throughput. Offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of MTFM, demonstrating that significant performance gains are achieved by scaling both model capacity and multi-scenario training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-EvolveRec: Self-Evolving Recommender Systems with LLM-based Directional Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12612v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional methods for automating recommender system design, such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS), are often constrained by a fixed search space defined by human priors, limiting innovation to pre-defined operators. While recent LLM-driven code evolution frameworks shift fixed search space target to open-ended program spaces, they primarily rely on scalar metrics (e.g., NDCG, Hit Ratio) that fail to provide qualitative insights into model failures or directional guidance for improvement. To address this, we propose Self-EvolveRec, a novel framework that establishes a directional feedback loop by integrating a User Simulator for qualitative critiques and a Model Diagnosis Tool for quantitative internal verification. Furthermore, we introduce a Diagnosis Tool - Model Co-Evolution strategy to ensure that evaluation criteria dynamically adapt as the recommendation architecture evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Self-EvolveRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art NAS and LLM-driven code evolution baselines in both recommendation performance and user satisfaction. Our code is available at https://github.com/Sein-Kim/self_evolverec.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAPTS: Channel-Aware, Preference-Aligned Trigger Selection for Multi-Channel Item-to-Item Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12564v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale industrial recommender systems commonly adopt multi-channel retrieval for candidate generation, combining direct user-to-item (U2I) retrieval with two-hop user-to-item-to-item (U2I2I) pipelines. In U2I2I, the system selects a small set of historical interactions as triggers to seed downstream item-to-item (I2I) retrieval across multiple channels. In production, triggers are often selected using rule-based policies or learned scorers and tuned in a channel-by-channel manner. However, these practices face two persistent challenges: biased value attribution that values triggers by on-trigger feedback rather than their downstream utility as retrieval seeds, and uncoordinated multi-channel routing where channels select triggers independently under a shared quota, increasing cross-channel overlap. To address these challenges, we propose Channel-Aware, Preference-Aligned Trigger Selection (CAPTS), a unified and flexible framework that treats multi-channel trigger selection as a learnable routing problem. CAPTS introduces a Value Attribution Module (VAM) that provides look-ahead supervision by crediting each trigger with the subsequent engagement generated by items retrieved from it on each I2I channel, and a Channel-Adaptive Trigger Routing (CATR) module that coordinates trigger-to-channel assignment to maximize the overall value of multi-channel retrieval. Extensive offline experiments and large-scale online A/B tests on Kwai, Kuaishou's international short-video platform, show that CAPTS consistently improves multi-channel recall offline and delivers a +0.351% lift in average time spent per device online.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00602v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected reward at every round is no less than $(1-α)$ times that of a baseline policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters). Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves regret $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|λ_2|)}}\right)$ with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and $|λ_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning to Rank: An End-to-End Solution for Exploiting Large Language Models for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12530v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are tasked to infer users' evolving preferences and rank items aligned with their intents, which calls for in-depth reasoning beyond pattern-based scoring. Recent efforts start to leverage large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, but how to effectively optimize the model for improved recommendation utility is still under explored. In this work, we propose Reasoning to Rank, an end-to-end training framework that internalizes recommendation utility optimization into the learning of step-by-step reasoning in LLMs. To avoid position bias in LLM reasoning and enable direct optimization of the reasoning process, our framework performs reasoning at the user-item level and employs reinforcement learning for end-to-end training of the LLM. Experiments on three Amazon datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset showed consistent gains over strong conventional and LLM-based solutions. Extensive in-depth analyses validate the necessity of the key components in the proposed framework and shed lights on the future developments of this line of work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Users Fix Algorithms? A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Collective Content Amplification in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04525v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Users of social media platforms based on recommendation systems (e.g. TikTok, X, YouTube) strategically interact with platform content to influence future recommendations. On some such platforms, users have been documented to form large-scale grassroots movements encouraging others to purposefully interact with algorithmically suppressed content in order to counteractively ``boost'' its recommendation. However, despite widespread documentation of this phenomenon, there is little theoretical work analyzing its impact on the platform or users themselves. We study a game between users and a RecSys, where users (potentially strategically) interact with the content available to them, and the RecSys -- limited by preference learning ability -- provides each user her approximately most-preferred item. We compare recommendations and social welfare when users interact with content according to their personal interests and when a collective of users intentionally interacts with an otherwise suppressed item. We provide sufficient conditions to ensure a pareto improvement in recommendations and strict increases in user social welfare under collective interaction, and provide a robust algorithm to find an effective collective strategy. Interestingly, despite the intended algorithmic protest of these movements, we show that for commonly assumed recommender utility functions, effective collective strategies also improve the utility of the RecSys. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by empirical results of effective collective interaction strategies on the GoodReads dataset and an online survey on how real-world users attempt to influence others' recommendations on RecSys platforms. Our findings examine how and when platforms' recommendation algorithms may incentivize users to collectivize and interact with content in algorithmic protest as well as what this collectivization means for the platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[Principled Synthetic Data Enables the First Scaling Laws for LLMs in Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07298v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a promising frontier for recommender systems, yet their development has been impeded by the absence of predictable scaling laws, which are crucial for guiding research and optimizing resource allocation. We hypothesize that this may be attributed to the inherent noise, bias, and incompleteness of raw user interaction data in prior continual pre-training (CPT) efforts. This paper introduces a novel, layered framework for generating high-quality synthetic data that circumvents such issues by creating a curated, pedagogical curriculum for the LLM. We provide powerful, direct evidence for the utility of our curriculum by showing that standard sequential models trained on our principled synthetic data significantly outperform ($+130\%$ on recall@100 for SasRec) models trained on real data in downstream ranking tasks, demonstrating its superiority for learning generalizable user preference patterns. Building on this, we empirically demonstrate, for the first time, robust power-law scaling for an LLM that is continually pre-trained on our high-quality, recommendation-specific data. Our experiments reveal consistent and predictable perplexity reduction across multiple synthetic data modalities. These findings establish a foundational methodology for reliable scaling LLM capabilities in the recommendation domain, thereby shifting the research focus from mitigating data deficiencies to leveraging high-quality, structured information.</p></details> | <details><summary>added...</summary><p>added more results on scaling law analysis</p></details> |
| **[Online Tensor Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17111v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary applications, such as recommendation systems and mobile health monitoring, require real-time processing and analysis of sequentially arriving high-dimensional tensor data. Traditional offline learning, involving the storage and utilization of all data in each computational iteration, becomes impractical for these tasks. Furthermore, existing low-rank tensor methods lack the capability for online statistical inference, which is essential for real-time predictions and informed decision-making. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel online inference framework for low-rank tensors. Our approach employs Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to enable efficient real-time data processing without extensive memory requirements. We establish a non-asymptotic convergence result for the online low-rank SGD estimator, nearly matches the minimax optimal estimation error rate of offline models. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet powerful online debiasing approach for sequential statistical inference. The entire online procedure, covering both estimation and inference, eliminates the need for data splitting or storing historical data, making it suitable for on-the-fly hypothesis testing. In our analysis, we control the sum of constructed super-martingales to ensure estimates along the entire solution path remain within the benign region. Additionally, a novel spectral representation tool is employed to address statistical dependencies among iterative estimates, establishing the desired asymptotic normality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Operations Research</p></details> |
| **[Deep Pareto Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03580v4)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously is an important task for recommendation platforms to improve their performance. However, this task is particularly challenging since the relationships between different objectives are heterogeneous across different consumers and dynamically fluctuating according to different contexts. Especially in those cases when objectives become conflicting with each other, the result of recommendations will form a pareto-frontier, where the improvements of any objective comes at the cost of a performance decrease of another objective. Existing multi-objective recommender systems do not systematically consider such dynamic relationships; instead, they balance between these objectives in a static and uniform manner, resulting in only suboptimal multi-objective recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a Deep Pareto Reinforcement Learning (DeepPRL) approach, where we (1) comprehensively model the complex relationships between multiple objectives in recommendations; (2) effectively capture personalized and contextual consumer preference for each objective to provide better recommendations; (3) optimize both the short-term and the long-term performance of multi-objective recommendations. As a result, our method achieves significant pareto-dominance over the state-of-the-art baselines in the offline experiments. Furthermore, we conducted a controlled experiment at the video streaming platform of Alibaba, where our method simultaneously improved three conflicting business objectives over the latest production system significantly, demonstrating its tangible economic impact in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preliminary version of the paper accepted at MISQ: https://doi.org/10.25300/MISQ/2025/19488 Please do not cite this version</p></details> |
| **[Compress, Cross and Scale: Multi-Level Compression Cross Networks for Efficient Scaling in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12041v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling high-order feature interactions efficiently is a central challenge in click-through rate and conversion rate prediction. Modern industrial recommender systems are predominantly built upon deep learning recommendation models, where the interaction backbone plays a critical role in determining both predictive performance and system efficiency. However, existing interaction modules often struggle to simultaneously achieve strong interaction capacity, high computational efficiency, and good scalability, resulting in limited ROI when models are scaled under strict production constraints. In this work, we propose MLCC, a structured feature interaction architecture that organizes feature crosses through hierarchical compression and dynamic composition, which can efficiently capture high-order feature dependencies while maintaining favorable computational complexity. We further introduce MC-MLCC, a Multi-Channel extension that decomposes feature interactions into parallel subspaces, enabling efficient horizontal scaling with improved representation capacity and significantly reduced parameter growth. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a large-scale industrial dataset show that our proposed models consistently outperform strong DLRM-style baselines by up to 0.52 AUC, while reducing model parameters and FLOPs by up to 26$\times$ under comparable performance. Comprehensive scaling analyses demonstrate stable and predictable scaling behavior across embedding dimension, head number, and channel count, with channel-based scaling achieving substantially better efficiency than conventional embedding inflation. Finally, online A/B testing on a real-world advertising platform validates the practical effectiveness of our approach, which has been widely adopted in Bilibili advertising system under strict latency and resource constraints.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Accelerating nuclear-norm regularized low-rank matrix optimization through Burer-Monteiro decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14067v4)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a rapid algorithm, BM-Global, for nuclear-norm-regularized convex and low-rank matrix optimization problems. BM-Global efficiently decreases the objective value via low-cost steps leveraging the nonconvex but smooth Burer-Monteiro (BM) decomposition, while effectively escapes saddle points and spurious local minima ubiquitous in the BM form to obtain guarantees of fast convergence rates to the global optima of the original nuclear-norm-regularized problem through aperiodic inexact proximal gradient steps on it. The proposed approach adaptively adjusts the rank for the BM decomposition and can provably identify an optimal rank for the BM decomposition problem automatically in the course of optimization through tools of manifold identification. BM-Global hence also spends significantly less time on parameter tuning than existing matrix-factorization methods, which require an exhaustive search for finding this optimal rank. Extensive experiments on real-world large-scale problems of recommendation systems, regularized kernel estimation, and molecular conformation confirm that BM-Global can indeed effectively escapes spurious local minima at which existing BM approaches are stuck, and is a magnitude faster than state-of-the-art algorithms for low-rank matrix optimization problems involving a nuclear-norm regularizer. Based on this research, we have released an open-source package of the proposed BM-Global at https://www.github.com/leepei/BM-Global/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Remov...</summary><p>Removed a wrong claim in Theorem 5</p></details> |
| **[Learning Conditional Averages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11920v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the problem of learning conditional averages in the PAC framework. The learner receives a sample labeled by an unknown target concept from a known concept class, as in standard PAC learning. However, instead of learning the target concept itself, the goal is to predict, for each instance, the average label over its neighborhood -- an arbitrary subset of points that contains the instance. In the degenerate case where all neighborhoods are singletons, the problem reduces exactly to classic PAC learning. More generally, it extends PAC learning to a setting that captures learning tasks arising in several domains, including explainability, fairness, and recommendation systems. Our main contribution is a complete characterization of when conditional averages are learnable, together with sample complexity bounds that are tight up to logarithmic factors. The characterization hinges on the joint finiteness of two novel combinatorial parameters, which depend on both the concept class and the neighborhood system, and are closely related to the independence number of the associated neighborhood graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query-Mixed Interest Extraction and Heterogeneous Interaction: A Scalable CTR Model for Industrial Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09387v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning effective feature interactions is central to modern recommender systems, yet remains challenging in industrial settings due to sparse multi-field inputs and ultra-long user behavior sequences. While recent scaling efforts have improved model capacity, they often fail to construct both context-aware and context-independent user intent from the long-term and real-time behavior sequence. Meanwhile, recent work also suffers from inefficient and homogeneous interaction mechanisms, leading to suboptimal prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose HeMix, a scalable ranking model that unifies adaptive sequence tokenization and heterogeneous interaction structure. Specifically, HeMix introduces a Query-Mixed Interest Extraction module that jointly models context-aware and context-independent user interests via dynamic and fixed queries over global and real-time behavior sequences. For interaction, we replace self-attention with the HeteroMixer block, enabling efficient, multi-granularity cross-feature interactions that adopt the multi-head token fusion, heterogeneous interaction and group-aligned reconstruction pipelines. HeMix demonstrates favorable scaling behavior, driven by the HeteroMixer block, where increasing model scale via parameter expansion leads to steady improvements in recommendation accuracy. Experiments on industrial-scale datasets show that HeMix scales effectively and consistently outperforms strong baselines. Most importantly, HeMix has been deployed on the AMAP platform, delivering significant online gains over DLRM: +3.61\% GMV, +2.78\% PV\_CTR, and +2.12\% UV\_CVR.</p></details> |  |
| **[ULTRA:Urdu Language Transformer-based Recommendation Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11836v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urdu, as a low-resource language, lacks effective semantic content recommendation systems, particularly in the domain of personalized news retrieval. Existing approaches largely rely on lexical matching or language-agnostic techniques, which struggle to capture semantic intent and perform poorly under varying query lengths and information needs. This limitation results in reduced relevance and adaptability in Urdu content recommendation. We propose ULTRA (Urdu Language Transformer-based Recommendation Architecture),an adaptive semantic recommendation framework designed to address these challenges. ULTRA introduces a dual-embedding architecture with a query-length aware routing mechanism that dynamically distinguishes between short, intent-focused queries and longer, context-rich queries. Based on a threshold-driven decision process, user queries are routed to specialized semantic pipelines optimized for either title/headline-level or full-content/document level representations, ensuring appropriate semantic granularity during retrieval. The proposed system leverages transformer-based embeddings and optimized pooling strategies to move beyond surface-level keyword matching and enable context-aware similarity search. Extensive experiments conducted on a large-scale Urdu news corpus demonstrate that the proposed architecture consistently improves recommendation relevance across diverse query types. Results show gains in precision above 90% compared to single-pipeline baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of query-adaptive semantic alignment for low-resource languages. The findings establish ULTRA as a robust and generalizable content recommendation architecture, offering practical design insights for semantic retrieval systems in low-resource language settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Reasoning Re-ranker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07774v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies increasingly explore Large Language Models (LLMs) as a new paradigm for recommendation systems due to their scalability and world knowledge. However, existing work has three key limitations: (1) most efforts focus on retrieval and ranking, while the reranking phase, critical for refining final recommendations, is largely overlooked; (2) LLMs are typically used in zero-shot or supervised fine-tuning settings, leaving their reasoning abilities, especially those enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) and high-quality reasoning data, underexploited; (3) items are commonly represented by non-semantic IDs, creating major scalability challenges in industrial systems with billions of identifiers. To address these gaps, we propose the Generative Reasoning Reranker (GR2), an end-to-end framework with a three-stage training pipeline tailored for reranking. First, a pretrained LLM is mid-trained on semantic IDs encoded from non-semantic IDs via a tokenizer achieving $\ge$99% uniqueness. Next, a stronger larger-scale LLM generates high-quality reasoning traces through carefully designed prompting and rejection sampling, which are used for supervised fine-tuning to impart foundational reasoning skills. Finally, we apply Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO), enabling scalable RL supervision with verifiable rewards designed specifically for reranking. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate GR2's effectiveness: it surpasses the state-of-the-art OneRec-Think by 2.4% in Recall@5 and 1.3% in NDCG@5. Ablations confirm that advanced reasoning traces yield substantial gains across metrics. We further find that RL reward design is crucial in reranking: LLMs tend to exploit reward hacking by preserving item order, motivating conditional verifiable rewards to mitigate this behavior and optimize reranking performance.</p></details> | 31 pages |
| **[Distinguishing True Influence from Hyperprolificity with Citation Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03527v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately evaluating scholarly influence is essential for fair academic assessment, yet traditional bibliometric indicators - dominated by publication and citation counts - often favor hyperprolific authors over those with deeper, long-term impact. We propose the x-index, a novel citation-based metric that conceptualizes citation as a process of knowledge diffusion and incorporates citation distance to reflect the structural reach of scholarly work. By weighting citations according to the collaborative proximity between citing and cited authors, the x-index captures both the depth and breadth of influence within evolving academic networks. Empirical analyses show that the x-index significantly improves the rankings of Turing Award recipients while reducing those of hyperprolific authors, better aligning rankings with recognized academic merit. It also demonstrates superior discriminatory power among early-career researchers and reveals stronger sensitivity to institutional research quality. These results suggest that the x-index offers a more equitable and forward-looking alternative to existing metrics, with practical applications in talent identification, funding decisions, and academic recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Code: Empirical Insights into How Team Dynamics Influence OSS Project Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11692v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-source software (OSS) development relies on effective collaboration among distributed contributors. Yet, current OSS project recommendation systems primarily emphasize technical attributes, overlooking the collaboration and community aspects that influence contributors' decisions to join and remain in projects. This study investigates how team dynamics within OSS communities influence project selection and how these preferences vary across contributors' motivations. We conducted an online survey with 198 OSS practitioners, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to capture contributors' perceptions of team dynamics. The results reveal that communication-related team dynamics such as responsiveness, tone, and clarity of replies are consistently prioritized across practitioners. However, the relative importance of these team dynamics differs according to contributors' motivations. For instance, practitioners motivated by gaining reputation or networking preferred inclusive project communities that encouraged diverse participation. These findings highlight that understanding how team dynamics align with contributors' motivations provides valuable insights into practitioners' project selection behaviour. Those insights can inform the design of future human-aware project recommendation systems that better account for social collaboration quality and motivational fit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Internalizing Multi-Agent Reasoning for Accurate and Efficient LLM-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09829v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping recommender systems by leveraging extensive world knowledge and semantic reasoning to interpret user intent. However, effectively integrating these capabilities with collaborative signals while avoiding prohibitive inference latency remains a critical bottleneck. To address this, we propose a trajectory-driven internalization framework to develop a Single-agent Trajectory-Aligned Recommender (STAR). Specifically, to internalize complex reasoning capabilities into a single efficient model, we first design a multi-agent teacher system capable of multi-turn tool usage and reflection. This teacher utilizes a Collaborative Signal Translation mechanism to explicitly convert latent behavioral patterns into descriptive natural language evidence to enhance reasoning accuracy. Subsequently, a trajectory-driven distillation pipeline transfers this agentic logic, including planning, tool usage, and self-reflection, into the compact STAR model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAR surpasses its teacher by 8.7% to 39.5% while eliminating iterative latency, paving the way for real-time, reasoning-enhanced recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPR: Towards a Generative Pre-trained One-Model Paradigm for Large-Scale Advertising Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10138v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an intelligent infrastructure connecting users with commercial content, advertising recommendation systems play a central role in information flow and value creation within the digital economy. However, existing multi-stage advertising recommendation systems suffer from objective misalignment and error propagation, making it difficult to achieve global optimality, while unified generative recommendation models still struggle to meet the demands of practical industrial applications. To address these issues, we propose GPR (Generative Pre-trained Recommender), the first one-model framework that redefines advertising recommendation as an end-to-end generative task, replacing the traditional cascading paradigm with a unified generative approach. To realize GPR, we introduce three key innovations spanning unified representation, network architecture, and training strategy. First, we design a unified input schema and tokenization method tailored to advertising scenarios, mapping both ads and organic content into a shared multi-level semantic ID space, thereby enhancing semantic alignment and modeling consistency across heterogeneous data. Second, we develop the Heterogeneous Hierarchical Decoder (HHD), a dual-decoder architecture that decouples user intent modeling from ad generation, achieving a balance between training efficiency and inference flexibility while maintaining strong modeling capacity. Finally, we propose a multi-stage joint training strategy that integrates Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), Value-Aware Fine-Tuning and the Hierarchy Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO) algorithm, forming a complete generative recommendation pipeline that unifies interest modeling, value alignment, and policy optimization. GPR has been fully deployed in the Tencent Weixin Channels advertising system, delivering significant improvements in key business metrics including GMV and CTCVR.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Cognitive Distribution and Behavior-Consistent Framework for Black-Box Attacks on Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10633v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing deployment of sequential recommender systems in e-commerce and other fields, their black-box interfaces raise security concerns: models are vulnerable to extraction and subsequent adversarial manipulation. Existing black-box extraction attacks primarily rely on hard labels or pairwise learning, often ignoring the importance of ranking positions, which results in incomplete knowledge transfer. Moreover, adversarial sequences generated via pure gradient methods lack semantic consistency with real user behavior, making them easily detectable. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a dual-enhanced attack framework. First, drawing on primacy effects and position bias, we introduce a cognitive distribution-driven extraction mechanism that maps discrete rankings into continuous value distributions with position-aware decay, thereby advancing from order alignment to cognitive distribution alignment. Second, we design a behavior-aware noisy item generation strategy that jointly optimizes collaborative signals and gradient signals. This ensures both semantic coherence and statistical stealth while effectively promoting target item rankings. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both attack success rate and evasion rate, validating the value of integrating cognitive modeling and behavioral consistency for secure recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LASER: An Efficient Target-Aware Segmented Attention Framework for End-to-End Long Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11562v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling ultra-long user behavior sequences is pivotal for capturing evolving and lifelong interests in modern recommendation systems. However, deploying such models in real-time industrial environments faces a strict "Latency Wall", constrained by two distinct bottlenecks: the high I/O latency of retrieving massive user histories and the quadratic computational complexity of standard attention mechanisms. To break these bottlenecks, we present LASER, a full-stack optimization framework developed and deployed at Xiaohongshu (RedNote). Our approach tackles the challenges through two complementary innovations: (1) System efficiency: We introduce SeqVault, a unified schema-aware serving infrastructure for long user histories. By implementing a hybrid DRAM-SSD indexing strategy, SeqVault reduces retrieval latency by 50% and CPU usage by 75%, ensuring millisecond-level access to full real-time and life-cycle user histories. (2) Algorithmic efficiency: We propose a Segmented Target Attention (STA) mechanism to address the computational overhead. Motivated by the inherent sparsity of user interests, STA employs a sigmoid-based gating strategy that acts as a silence mechanism to filter out noisy items. Subsequently, a lightweight Global Stacked Target Attention (GSTA) module refines these compressed segments to capture cross-segment dependencies without incurring high computational costs. This design performs effective sequence compression, reducing the complexity of long-sequence modeling while preserving critical signals. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate that LASER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In large-scale online A/B testing serving over 100 million daily active users, LASER achieved a 2.36% lift in ADVV and a 2.08% lift in revenue, demonstrating its scalability and significant commercial impact.</p></details> | 9 pages |

While multimodal content offers a promising solution, existing methods result in suboptimal representations for new items due to noise and entanglement in sparse data. To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios. Our work validates that discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Main Track)</p></details> |

Recently, generative reranking has gained increasing attention for formulating reranking as a holistic sequence generation task, implicitly modeling complex dependencies among items. However, most existing methods suffer from the likelihood trap, where high-likelihood sequences are often repetitive and perceived as low-quality by humans, thereby limiting user engagement. In this work, we propose Consistent Graph-structured Generative Recommendation (CONGRATS). We first introduce a novel Graph-structured Model, which enables the generation of more diverse sequences by exploring multiple paths. This design not only expands the decoding space to promote diversity, but also improves prediction accuracy by explicitly modeling item dependencies from graph transitions. Furthermore, we design a Consistent Differentiable Training method that incorporates an evaluator, allowing the model to learn directly from user preferences. Extensive offline experiments validate the superior performance of CONGRATS over state-of-the-art reranking methods. Moreover, CONGRATS has been evaluated on a large-scale video-sharing app, Kuaishou, with over 300 million daily active users, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves both recommendation quality and diversity, validating our effectiveness in practical industrial platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Assortment Optimization from Observational Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10696v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assortment optimization is a fundamental challenge in modern retail and recommendation systems, where the goal is to select a subset of products that maximizes expected revenue under complex customer choice behaviors. While recent advances in data-driven methods have leveraged historical data to learn and optimize assortments, these approaches typically rely on strong assumptions -- namely, the stability of customer preferences and the correctness of the underlying choice models. However, such assumptions frequently break in real-world scenarios due to preference shifts and model misspecification, leading to poor generalization and revenue loss. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a robust framework for data-driven assortment optimization that accounts for potential distributional shifts in customer choice behavior. Our approach models potential preference shift from a nominal choice model that generates data and seeks to maximize worst-case expected revenue. We first establish the computational tractability of robust assortment planning when the nominal model is known, then advance to the data-driven setting, where we design statistically optimal algorithms that minimize the data requirements while maintaining robustness. Our theoretical analysis provides both upper bounds and matching lower bounds on the sample complexity, offering theoretical guarantees for robust generalization. Notably, we uncover and identify the notion of ``robust item-wise coverage'' as the minimal data requirement to enable sample-efficient robust assortment learning. Our work bridges the gap between robustness and statistical efficiency in assortment learning, contributing new insights and tools for reliable assortment optimization under uncertainty.</p></details> | 65 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Boundary-Aware Multi-Behavior Dynamic Graph Transformer for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10493v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the landscape of contemporary recommender systems, user-item interactions are inherently dynamic and sequential, often characterized by various behaviors. Prior research has explored the modeling of user preferences through sequential interactions and the user-item interaction graph, utilizing advanced techniques such as graph neural networks and transformer-based architectures. However, these methods typically fall short in simultaneously accounting for the dynamic nature of graph topologies and the sequential pattern of interactions in user preference models. Moreover, they often fail to adequately capture the multiple user behavior boundaries during model optimization. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a boundary-aware Multi-Behavioral Dynamic Graph Transformer (MB-DGT) model that dynamically refines the graph structure to reflect the evolving patterns of user behaviors and interactions. Our model involves a transformer-based dynamic graph aggregator for user preference modeling, which assimilates the changing graph structure and the sequence of user behaviors. This integration yields a more comprehensive and dynamic representation of user preferences. For model optimization, we implement a user-specific multi-behavior loss function that delineates the interest boundaries among different behaviors, thereby enriching the personalized learning of user preferences. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets indicate that our model consistently delivers remarkable recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChainRec: An Agentic Recommender Learning to Route Tool Chains for Diverse and Evolving Interests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10490v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into recommender systems, motivating recent interest in agentic and reasoning-based recommendation. However, most existing approaches still rely on fixed workflows, applying the same reasoning procedure across diverse recommendation scenarios. In practice, user contexts vary substantially-for example, in cold-start settings or during interest shifts, so an agent should adaptively decide what evidence to gather next rather than following a scripted process. To address this, we propose ChainRec, an agentic recommender that uses a planner to dynamically select reasoning tools. ChainRec builds a standardized Tool Agent Library from expert trajectories. It then trains a planner using supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization to dynamically select tools, decide their order, and determine when to stop. Experiments on AgentRecBench across Amazon, Yelp, and Goodreads show that ChainRec consistently improves Avg HR@{1,3,5} over strong baselines, with especially notable gains in cold-start and evolving-interest scenarios. Ablation studies further validate the importance of tool standardization and preference-optimized planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compute Only Once: UG-Separation for Efficient Large Recommendation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10455v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by scaling laws, recommender systems increasingly rely on large-scale models to capture complex feature interactions and user behaviors, but this trend also leads to prohibitive training and inference costs. While long-sequence models(e.g., LONGER) can reuse user-side computation through KV caching, such reuse is difficult in dense feature interaction architectures(e.g., RankMixer), where user and group (candidate item) features are deeply entangled across layers. In this work, we propose User-Group Separation (UG-Sep), a novel framework that enables reusable user-side computation in dense interaction models for the first time. UG-Sep introduces a masking mechanism that explicitly disentangles user-side and item-side information flows within token-mixing layers, ensuring that a subset of tokens to preserve purely user-side representations across layers. This design enables corresponding token computations to be reused across multiple samples, significantly reducing redundant inference cost. To compensate for potential expressiveness loss induced by masking, we further propose an Information Compensation strategy that adaptively reconstructs suppressed user-item interactions. Moreover, as UG-Sep substantially reduces user-side FLOPs and exposes memory-bound components, we incorporate W8A16 (8-bit weight, 16-bit activation) weight-only quantization to alleviate memory bandwidth bottlenecks and achieve additional acceleration. We conduct extensive offline evaluations and large-scale online A/B experiments at ByteDance, demonstrating that UG-Sep reduces inference latency by up to 20 percent without degrading online user experience or commercial metrics across multiple business scenarios, including feed recommendation and advertising systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Large...</summary><p>Large Recommender Model, Industrial Recommenders, Scaling Law</p></details> |

These embeddings predict students' skills across multiple programming topics, producing profiles that are matched to the skills required by unseen homework problems. To generate recommendations, we compute the cosine similarity between student profiles and problem skill vectors, ranking exercises according to their alignment with each student's current abilities. We evaluated our approach using real data from students and exercises in an introductory programming course at our university. First, we assessed the effectiveness of our source code embeddings for predicting skills, comparing them with token-based and graph-based alternatives. Results showed that Jina embeddings outperformed TF-IDF, CodeBERT-cpp, and GraphCodeBERT across most skills. Additionally, we evaluated the system's ability to recommend exercises aligned with weekly course content by analyzing student submissions collected over seven course offerings. Our approach consistently produced more suitable recommendations than baselines based on correctness or solution time, indicating that predicted programming skills provide a stronger signal for problem recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, to be published in LAK26: 16th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference (LAK 2026)</p></details> |

Achieving substantial improvements in these areas is a non-trivial task, traditionally relying on extensive manual iterations to test new hypotheses. We propose a self-evolving system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically those from Google's Gemini family, to autonomously generate, train, and deploy high-performing, complex model changes within an end-to-end automated workflow. The self-evolving system is comprised of an Offline Agent (Inner Loop) that performs high-throughput hypothesis generation using proxy metrics, and an Online Agent (Outer Loop) that validates candidates against delayed north star business metrics in live production. Our agents act as specialized Machine Learning Engineers (MLEs): they exhibit deep reasoning capabilities, discovering novel improvements in optimization algorithms and model architecture, and formulating innovative reward functions that target long-term user engagement. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through several successful production launches at YouTube, confirming that autonomous, LLM-driven evolution can surpass traditional engineering workflows in both development velocity and model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kunlun: Establishing Scaling Laws for Massive-Scale Recommendation Systems through Unified Architecture Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10016v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deriving predictable scaling laws that govern the relationship between model performance and computational investment is crucial for designing and allocating resources in massive-scale recommendation systems. While such laws are established for large language models, they remain challenging for recommendation systems, especially those processing both user history and context features. We identify poor scaling efficiency as the main barrier to predictable power-law scaling, stemming from inefficient modules with low Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) and suboptimal resource allocation. We introduce Kunlun, a scalable architecture that systematically improves model efficiency and resource allocation. Our low-level optimizations include Generalized Dot-Product Attention (GDPA), Hierarchical Seed Pooling (HSP), and Sliding Window Attention. Our high-level innovations feature Computation Skip (CompSkip) and Event-level Personalization. These advances increase MFU from 17% to 37% on NVIDIA B200 GPUs and double scaling efficiency over state-of-the-art methods. Kunlun is now deployed in major Meta Ads models, delivering significant production impact.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Efficient Learning of Sparse Representations from Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09935v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behavioral patterns captured in embeddings learned from interaction data are pivotal across various stages of production recommender systems. However, in the initial retrieval stage, practitioners face an inherent tradeoff between embedding expressiveness and the scalability and latency of serving components, resulting in the need for representations that are both compact and expressive. To address this challenge, we propose a training strategy for learning high-dimensional sparse embedding layers in place of conventional dense ones, balancing efficiency, representational expressiveness, and interpretability. To demonstrate our approach, we modified the production-grade collaborative filtering autoencoder ELSA, achieving up to 10x reduction in embedding size with no loss of recommendation accuracy, and up to 100x reduction with only a 2.5% loss. Moreover, the active embedding dimensions reveal an interpretable inverted-index structure that segments items in a way directly aligned with the model's latent space, thereby enabling integration of segment-level recommendation functionality (e.g., 2D homepage layouts) within the candidate retrieval model itself.

First, current approaches lack a mechanism for automated, data-driven discovery of effective reasoning patterns, relying instead on brittle manual templates or unstable zero-shot prompting. Second, they employ structure-collapsing integration: direct prompting incurs prohibitive online inference costs, while feature extraction collapses reasoning chains into single vectors, discarding stepwise logic. To address these challenges, we propose SCoTER (Structured Chain-of-Thought Transfer for Enhanced Recommendation), a unified framework that treats pattern discovery and structure-aware transfer as a jointly optimized problem. Specifically, SCoTER operationalizes this through two synergistic components: a Generate-Validate-Mine (GVM) pipeline for automated pattern discovery and a structure-preserving integration architecture that transfers stepwise logic to efficient models. Empirically, experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements across diverse backbones. Moreover, in production deployment on the Tencent Advertising Platform, SCoTER achieved a 2.14\% lift in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) while eliminating online LLM inference costs. Overall, SCoTER presents a practical and unified framework for integrating structured LLM reasoning into recommender systems, validated by consistent improvements in both offline benchmarks and online production environments.</p></details> |  |

Typically powered by machine learning methods, predictive models are used in recommendations, financial fraud detection, supply chain optimization, and other systems, providing billions of predictions every day. However, training a machine learning model requires manual work to extract the required training examples - prediction entities and target labels - from the database, which is slow, laborious, and prone to mistakes. Here, we present the Predictive Query Language (PQL), a SQL-inspired declarative language for defining predictive tasks on relational databases. PQL allows specifying a predictive task in a single declarative query, enabling the automatic computation training labels for a large variety of machine learning tasks, such as regression, classification, time-series forecasting, and recommender systems. PQL is already successfully integrated and used in a collection of use cases as part of a predictive AI platform. The versatility of the language can be demonstrated through its many ongoing use cases, including financial fraud, item recommendations, and workload prediction. We demonstrate its versatile design through two implementations; one for small-scale, low-latency use and one that can handle large-scale databases.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose a unified \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{D}istribution \textbf{L}earning (MDL) framework, inspired by the "prompting" paradigm in large language models (LLMs). MDL treats scenario and task information as specialized tokens rather than auxiliary inputs or gating signals. Specifically, we introduce a unified information tokenization module that transforms features, scenarios, and tasks into a unified tokenized format. To facilitate deep interaction, we design three synergistic mechanisms: (1) feature token self-attention for rich feature interactions, (2) domain-feature attention for scenario/task-adaptive feature activation, and (3) domain-fused aggregation for joint distribution prediction. By stacking these interactions, MDL enables scenario and task information to "prompt" and activate the model's vast parameter space in a bottom-up, layer-wise manner. Extensive experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that MDL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MSL and MTL baselines. Online A/B testing on Douyin Search platform over one month yields +0.0626\% improvement in LT30 and -0.3267\% reduction in change query rate. MDL has been fully deployed in production, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Since these models are not originally trained for recommendation tasks, recent works efficiently adapt them via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, even with PEFT, item embeddings from multimodal foundation models remain user-blind: item embeddings are not conditioned on user interests, despite the fact that users with diverse interests attend to different item aspects. To address this limitation, we propose PerPEFT, a personalized PEFT strategy for multimodal recommendation. Specifically, PerPEFT groups users by interest and assigns a distinct PEFT module to each group, enabling each module to capture the fine-grained item aspects most predictive of that group`s purchase decisions. We further introduce a specialized training technique that strengthens this user-group conditioning. Notably, PerPEFT is PEFT-agnostic and can be paired with any PEFT method applicable to multimodal foundation models. Through extensive experiments, we show that (1) PerPEFT outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 15.3% (NDCG@20) and (2) delivers consistent gains across diverse PEFT variants. It is noteworthy that, even with personalization, PEFT remains lightweight, adding only 1.3% of the parameter count of the foundation model.

Latent factor models represent users and items as real-valued embedding vectors for pairwise similarity computation, and all embeddings are traditionally restricted to a uniform size that is relatively large (e.g., 256-dimensional). With the exponentially expanding user base and item catalog in contemporary e-commerce, this design is admittedly becoming memory-inefficient. To facilitate lightweight recommendation, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently opened up opportunities for identifying varying embedding sizes for different users/items. However, challenged by search efficiency and learning an optimal RL policy, existing RL-based methods are restricted to highly discrete, predefined embedding size choices. This leads to a largely overlooked potential of introducing finer granularity into embedding sizes to obtain better recommendation effectiveness under a given memory budget. In this paper, we propose continuous input embedding size search (CIESS), a novel RL-based method that operates on a continuous search space with arbitrary embedding sizes to choose from. In CIESS, we further present an innovative random walk-based exploration strategy to allow the RL policy to efficiently explore more candidate embedding sizes and converge to a better decision. CIESS is also model-agnostic and hence generalizable to a variety of latent factor RSs, whilst experiments on two real-world datasets have shown state-of-the-art performance of CIESS under different memory budgets when paired with three popular recommendation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGIR'23.

Recent advances in model scaling have shown promising gains in recommendation. However, naively increasing model capacity imposes prohibitive online inference costs and often yields diminishing returns for sparse tasks with skewed label distributions. This mismatch between uniform parameter scaling and heterogeneous task capacity demands poses a fundamental challenge for scalable multi-task recommendation. In this work, we investigate parameter sparsification as a principled scaling paradigm and identify two critical obstacles when applying sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to multi-task recommendation: exploded expert activation that undermines instance-level sparsity and expert load skew caused by independent task-wise routing. To address these challenges, we propose SMES, a scalable sparse MoE framework with progressive expert routing. SMES decomposes expert activation into a task-shared expert subset jointly selected across tasks and task-adaptive private experts, explicitly bounding per-instance expert execution while preserving task-specific capacity. In addition, SMES introduces a global multi-gate load-balancing regularizer that stabilizes training by regulating aggregated expert utilization across all tasks. SMES has been deployed in Kuaishou large-scale short-video services, supporting over 400 million daily active users. Extensive online experiments demonstrate stable improvements, with GAUC gain of 0.29% and a 0.31% uplift in user watch time.</p></details> |  |

Motivation modeling, crucial for decision-making and content preference, explains recommendation generation. Existing methods often treat motivation as latent variables from interaction data, neglecting heterogeneous information like review text. In multimodal motivation fusion, two challenges arise: 1) achieving stable cross-modal alignment amid noise, and 2) identifying features reflecting the same underlying motivation across modalities. To address these, we propose LLM-driven Motivation-aware Multimodal Recommendation (LMMRec), a model-agnostic framework leveraging large language models for deep semantic priors and motivation understanding. LMMRec uses chain-of-thought prompting to extract fine-grained user and item motivations from text. A dual-encoder architecture models textual and interaction-based motivations for cross-modal alignment, while Motivation Coordination Strategy and Interaction-Text Correspondence Method mitigate noise and semantic drift through contrastive learning and momentum updates. Experiments on three datasets show LMMRec achieves up to a 4.98\% performance improvement.</p></details> |  |

A Joint Optimization with LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16759v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern recommender systems rely on large-scale ML models that are data-hungry and black-box. Recent advances in LLMs suggest that explicit reasoning can improve learning efficiency, yet it remains unclear how generative LLMs can systematically improve recommendation tasks that are discriminative in nature. Moreover, in personalized settings, LLMs tend to hallucinate. Existing explainable recommender systems either generate explanations independently of predictions or provide post-hoc rationales; in both cases, explanations do not improve accuracy over black-box recommenders. We argue that when properly calibrated to prediction outcomes, natural-language explanations can in fact improve recommendations. We propose RecPIE (Recommendation with Prediction-Informed Explanations), a framework that jointly optimizes prediction-informed explanations and explanation-informed predictions. In RecPIE, the recommendation task guides the learning of consumer representations, which are used by a trainable LLM to generate explanations for why a consumer may or may not like a product; these explanations are then fed back into a neural recommender to improve predictions. The two components are trained alternately, allowing explanations to be progressively refined based on how much they improve recommendation accuracy. Empirically, on next point-of-interest recommendation using Google Maps data, RecPIE improves accuracy by 3-4% over state-of-the-art baselines and matches the best baseline using only 12% of the training data. Human evaluations show that RecPIE's explanations are preferred 61.5% of the time among five competing methods. To our knowledge, this work is among the first to demonstrate that generative explanation and discriminative recommendation tasks can be jointly learned to outperform standalone approaches on either task.</p></details> |  |

In large-scale ad ranking, increasing model capacity is a promising path to improving both predictive performance and business outcomes, yet production serving budgets impose strict constraints on latency and FLOPs. This creates a central tension: we want interaction modules that both scale effectively with additional compute and remain compute-efficient at serving time. In this work, we study how to scale feature interaction modules under a fixed serving budget. We find that naively scaling DCNv2 and MaskNet, despite their widespread adoption in industry, yields rapidly diminishing offline gains in the Pinterest ads ranking system. To overcome aforementioned limitations, we propose ML-DCN, an interaction module that integrates an instance-conditioned mask into a low-rank crossing layer, enabling per-example selection and amplification of salient interaction directions while maintaining efficient computation. This novel architecture combines the strengths of DCNv2 and MaskNet, scales efficiently with increased compute, and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Experiments on a large internal Pinterest ads dataset show that ML-DCN achieves higher AUC than DCNv2, MaskNet, and recent scaling-oriented alternatives at matched FLOPs, and it scales more favorably overall as compute increases, exhibiting a stronger AUC-FLOPs trade-off. Finally, online A/B tests demonstrate statistically significant improvements in key ads metrics (including CTR and click-quality measures) and ML-DCN has been deployed in the production system with neutral serving cost.</p></details> |  |

Fine-tuning LLMs is parameter-inefficient, and prompt-based agentic reasoning is limited by context length and hallucination risk. Moreover, existing agentic recommendation systems predominantly leverages semantic knowledge while neglecting the collaborative filtering (CF) signals essential for implicit preference modeling. To address these limitations, we propose AMEM4Rec, an agentic LLM-based recommender that learns collaborative signals in an end-to-end manner through cross-user memory evolution. AMEM4Rec stores abstract user behavior patterns from user histories in a global memory pool. Within this pool, memories are linked to similar existing ones and iteratively evolved to reinforce shared cross-user patterns, enabling the system to become aware of CF signals without relying on a pre-trained CF model. Extensive experiments on Amazon and MIND datasets show that AMEM4Rec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based recommenders, demonstrating the effectiveness of evolving memory-guided collaborative filtering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Welfarist Formulations for Diverse Similarity Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08742v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) is a fundamental problem in data structures with wide-ranging applications, such as web search, recommendation systems, and, more recently, retrieval-augmented generations (RAG). In such recent applications, in addition to the relevance (similarity) of the returned neighbors, diversity among the neighbors is a central requirement. In this paper, we develop principled welfare-based formulations in NNS for realizing diversity across attributes. Our formulations are based on welfare functions -- from mathematical economics -- that satisfy central diversity (fairness) and relevance (economic efficiency) axioms. With a particular focus on Nash social welfare, we note that our welfare-based formulations provide objective functions that adaptively balance relevance and diversity in a query-dependent manner. Notably, such a balance was not present in the prior constraint-based approach, which forced a fixed level of diversity and optimized for relevance. In addition, our formulation provides a parametric way to control the trade-off between relevance and diversity, providing practitioners with flexibility to tailor search results to task-specific requirements. We develop efficient nearest neighbor algorithms with provable guarantees for the welfare-based objectives. Notably, our algorithm can be applied on top of any standard ANN method (i.e., use standard ANN method as a subroutine) to efficiently find neighbors that approximately maximize our welfare-based objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is practical and substantially improves diversity while maintaining high relevance of the retrieved neighbors.</p></details> |  |
| **[SRSUPM: Sequential Recommender System Based on User Psychological Motivation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08667v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommender infers users' evolving psychological motivations from historical interactions to recommend the next preferred items. Most existing methods compress recent behaviors into a single vector and optimize it toward a single observed target item, but lack explicit modeling of psychological motivation shift. As a result, they struggle to uncover the distributional patterns across different shift degrees and to capture collaborative knowledge that is sensitive to psychological motivation shift. We propose a general framework, the Sequential Recommender System Based on User Psychological Motivation, to enhance sequential recommenders with psychological motivation shift-aware user modeling. Specifically, the Psychological Motivation Shift Assessment quantitatively measures psychological motivation shift; guided by PMSA, the Shift Information Construction models dynamically evolving multi-level shift states, and the Psychological Motivation Shift-driven Information Decomposition decomposes and regularizes representations across shift levels. Moreover, the Psychological Motivation Shift Information Matching strengthens collaborative patterns related to psychological motivation shift to learn more discriminative user representations. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks show that SRSUPM consistently outperforms representative baselines on diverse sequential recommender tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 pages |
| **[Rethinking Multi-objective Ranking Ensemble in Recommender System: From Score Fusion to Rank Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02955v3)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The industrial recommender systems always pursue more than one business goals. The inherent intensions between objectives pose significant challenges for ranking stage. A popular solution is to build a multi-objective ensemble (ME) model to integrate multi-objective predictions into a unified score. Although there have been some exploratory efforts, few work has yet been able to systematically delineate the core requirements of ME problem. We rethink ME problem from two perspectives. From the perspective of each individual objective, to achieve its maximum value the scores should be as consistent as possible with the ranks of its labels. From the perspective of entire set of objectives, an overall optimum can be achieved only when the scores align with the commonality shared by the majority of objectives. However, none of existing methods can meet these two requirements. To fill this gap, we propose a novel multi-objective ensemble framework HarmonRank to fulfill both requirements. For rank consistency, we formulate rank consistency (AUC) metric as a rank-sum problem and make the model optimized towards rank consistency in an end-to-end differentiable manner. For commonality modeling, we change the original relation-agnostic ensemble paradigm to a relation-aware one. Extensive offline experimental results on two industrial datasets and online experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Besides, our method exhibits superior robustness to label skew situations which is common in industrial scenarios. The proposed method has been fully deployed in Kuaishou's live-streaming e-commerce recommendation platform with 400 million DAUs, contributing 2.6% purchase gain.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Breaking the Grid: Distance-Guided Reinforcement Learning in Large Discrete and Hybrid Action Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08616v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning is increasingly applied to logistics, scheduling, and recommender systems, but standard algorithms struggle with the curse of dimensionality in such large discrete action spaces. Existing algorithms typically rely on restrictive grid-based structures or computationally expensive nearest-neighbor searches, limiting their effectiveness in high-dimensional or irregularly structured domains. We propose Distance-Guided Reinforcement Learning (DGRL), combining Sampled Dynamic Neighborhoods (SDN) and Distance-Based Updates (DBU) to enable efficient RL in spaces with up to 10$^\text{20}$ actions. Unlike prior methods, SDN leverages a semantic embedding space to perform stochastic volumetric exploration, provably providing full support over a local trust region. Complementing this, DBU transforms policy optimization into a stable regression task, decoupling gradient variance from action space cardinality and guaranteeing monotonic policy improvement. DGRL naturally generalizes to hybrid continuous-discrete action spaces without requiring hierarchical dependencies. We demonstrate performance improvements of up to 66% against state-of-the-art benchmarks across regularly and irregularly structured environments, while simultaneously improving convergence speed and computational complexity.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |
| **[OneLive: Dynamically Unified Generative Framework for Live-Streaming Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08612v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Live-streaming recommender system serves as critical infrastructure that bridges the patterns of real-time interactions between users and authors. Similar to traditional industrial recommender systems, live-streaming recommendation also relies on cascade architectures to support large-scale concurrency. Recent advances in generative recommendation unify the multi-stage recommendation process with Transformer-based architectures, offering improved scalability and higher computational efficiency. However, the inherent complexity of live-streaming prevents the direct transfer of these methods to live-streaming scenario, where continuously evolving content, limited lifecycles, strict real-time constraints, and heterogeneous multi-objectives introduce unique challenges that invalidate static tokenization and conventional model framework. To address these issues, we propose OneLive, a dynamically unified generative recommendation framework tailored for live-streaming scenario. OneLive integrates four key components: (i) A Dynamic Tokenizer that continuously encodes evolving real-time live content fused with behavior signal through residual quantization; (ii) A Time-Aware Gated Attention mechanism that explicitly models temporal dynamics for timely decision making; (iii) An efficient decoder-only generative architecture enhanced with Sequential MTP and QK Norm for stable training and accelerated inference; (iv) A Unified Multi-Objective Alignment Framework reinforces policy optimization for personalized preferences.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[TFMLinker: Universal Link Predictor by Graph In-Context Learning with Tabular Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08592v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction is a fundamental task in graph machine learning with widespread applications such as recommendation systems, drug discovery, knowledge graphs, etc. In the foundation model era, how to develop universal link prediction methods across datasets and domains becomes a key problem, with some initial attempts adopting Graph Foundation Models utilizing Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models. However, the existing methods face notable limitations, including limited pre-training scale or heavy reliance on textual information. Motivated by the success of tabular foundation models (TFMs) in achieving universal prediction across diverse tabular datasets, we explore an alternative approach by TFMs, which are pre-trained on diverse synthetic datasets sampled from structural causal models and support strong in-context learning independent of textual attributes. Nevertheless, adapting TFMs for link prediction faces severe technical challenges such as how to obtain the necessary context and capture link-centric topological information. To solve these challenges, we propose TFMLinker (Tabular Foundation Model for Link Predictor), aiming to leverage the in-context learning capabilities of TFMs to perform link prediction across diverse graphs without requiring dataset-specific fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a prototype-augmented local-global context module to construct context that captures both graph-specific and cross-graph transferable patterns. Next, we design a universal topology-aware link encoder to capture link-centric topological information and generate link representations as inputs for the TFM. Finally, we employ the TFM to predict link existence through in-context learning. Experiments on 6 graph benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines without requiring dataset-specific finetuning.</p></details> |  |

We derive numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without explicitly forming the matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding an average per-step update cost and memory usage of $O(dr)$ for approximation rank $r$. The inference complexity of the proposed algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[RankGR: Rank-Enhanced Generative Retrieval with Listwise Direct Preference Optimization in Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08575v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a promising paradigm in recommendation systems by autoregressively decoding identifiers of target items. Despite its potential, current approaches typically rely on the next-token prediction schema, which treats each token of the next interacted items as the sole target. This narrow focus 1) limits their ability to capture the nuanced structure of user preferences, and 2) overlooks the deep interaction between decoded identifiers and user behavior sequences. In response to these challenges, we propose RankGR, a Rank-enhanced Generative Retrieval method that incorporates listwise direct preference optimization for recommendation. RankGR decomposes the retrieval process into two complementary stages: the Initial Assessment Phase (IAP) and the Refined Scoring Phase (RSP). In IAP, we incorporate a novel listwise direct preference optimization strategy into GR, thus facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of the hierarchical user preferences and more effective partial-order modeling. The RSP then refines the top-λ candidates generated by IAP with interactions towards input sequences using a lightweight scoring module, leading to more precise candidate evaluation. Both phases are jointly optimized under a unified GR model, ensuring consistency and efficiency. Additionally, we implement several practical improvements in training and deployment, ultimately achieving a real-time system capable of handling nearly ten thousand requests per second. Extensive offline performance on both research and industrial datasets, as well as the online gains on the "Guess You Like" section of Taobao, validate the effectiveness and scalability of RankGR.</p></details> |  |

Traditional RecSys relies on ID-based embeddings for user sequence modeling in the General Search Unit (GSU) and Exact Search Unit (ESU) paradigm, which suffers from low information density, knowledge isolation, and weak generalization ability. While LLMs offer complementary strengths with dense semantic representations and strong generalization, directly applying LLM embeddings to RecSys faces critical challenges: representation unmatch with business objectives and representation unlearning end-to-end with downstream tasks. In this paper, we present QARM V2, a unified framework that bridges LLM semantic understanding with RecSys business requirements for user sequence modeling.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[PIT: A Dynamic Personalized Item Tokenizer for End-to-End Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08530v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Recommendation has revolutionized recommender systems by reformulating retrieval as a sequence generation task over discrete item identifiers. Despite the progress, existing approaches typically rely on static, decoupled tokenization that ignores collaborative signals. While recent methods attempt to integrate collaborative signals into item identifiers either during index construction or through end-to-end modeling, they encounter significant challenges in real-world production environments. Specifically, the volatility of collaborative signals leads to unstable tokenization, and current end-to-end strategies often devolve into suboptimal two-stage training rather than achieving true co-evolution. To bridge this gap, we propose PIT, a dynamic Personalized Item Tokenizer framework for end-to-end generative recommendation, which employs a co-generative architecture that harmonizes collaborative patterns through collaborative signal alignment and synchronizes item tokenizer with generative recommender via a co-evolution learning. This enables the dynamic, joint, end-to-end evolution of both index construction and recommendation. Furthermore, a one-to-many beam index ensures scalability and robustness, facilitating seamless integration into large-scale industrial deployments. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that PIT consistently outperforms competitive baselines. In a large-scale deployment at Kuaishou, an online A/B test yielded a substantial 0.402% uplift in App Stay Time, validating the framework's effectiveness in dynamic industrial environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[REG4Rec: Reasoning-Enhanced Generative Model for Large-Scale Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15308v4)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation aims to predict a user's next action in large-scale recommender systems. While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient information interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially address this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture user intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into generative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance. However, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic representations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning pathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these issues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that constructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a self-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations. Specifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook (MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby constructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance the reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement stage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a Multi-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions tailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA introduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization. During inference, Consistency-Oriented Self-Reflection for Pruning (CORP) is proposed to discard inconsistent reasoning paths, preventing the propagation of erroneous reasoning. Lastly, we develop an efficient offline training strategy for large-scale recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets and online evaluations show that REG4Rec delivers outstanding performance and substantial practical value.</p></details> |  |

As large language models (LLMs) enter this domain, their scale, conversationality, and opacity introduce new challenges for situatedness, trust, and autonomy. Partnering with Collaborative Support Programs of New Jersey (CSPNJ), a statewide PRO in the Northeastern United States, we used comicboarding, a co-design method, to conduct workshops with 16 peer specialists and 10 service users exploring perceptions of integrating an LLM-based recommendation system into peer support. Findings show that depending on how LLMs are introduced, constrained, and co-used, they can reconfigure in-room dynamics by sustaining, undermining, or amplifying the relational authority that grounds peer support. We identify opportunities, risks, and mitigation strategies across three tensions: bridging scale and locality, protecting trust and relational dynamics, and preserving peer autonomy amid efficiency gains. We contribute design implications that center lived-experience-in-the-loop, reframe trust as co-constructed, and position LLMs not as clinical tools but as relational collaborators in high-stakes, community-led care.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 2 tables, 7 figures.

| **[Enhancing Bandit Algorithms with LLMs for Time-varying User Preferences in Streaming Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08067v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world streaming recommender systems, user preferences evolve dynamically over time. Existing bandit-based methods treat time merely as a timestamp, neglecting its explicit relationship with user preferences and leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, online learning methods often suffer from inefficient exploration-exploitation during the early online phase. To address these issues, we propose HyperBandit+, a novel contextual bandit policy that integrates a time-aware hypernetwork to adapt to time-varying user preferences and employs a large language model-assisted warm-start mechanism (LLM Start) to enhance exploration-exploitation efficiency in the early online phase. Specifically, HyperBandit+ leverages a neural network that takes time features as input and generates parameters for estimating time-varying rewards by capturing the correlation between time and user preferences. Additionally, the LLM Start mechanism employs multi-step data augmentation to simulate realistic interaction data for effective offline learning, providing warm-start parameters for the bandit policy in the early online phase. To meet real-time streaming recommendation demands, we adopt low-rank factorization to reduce hypernetwork training complexity. Theoretically, we rigorously establish a sublinear regret upper bound that accounts for both the hypernetwork and the LLM warm-start mechanism. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HyperBandit+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accumulated rewards.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we focus on the post-ranking stage and present LAFB (Learning to Alleviate Familiarity Bias), a lightweight and model-agnostic framework designed to mitigate familiarity bias in recommendation outputs. LAFB models user-content familiarity using discrete and continuous interaction features, and estimates personalized debiasing factors to adjust user rating prediction scores, thereby reducing the dominance of familiar content in the final ranking. We conduct large-scale offline evaluations and online A/B testing in a real-world recommendation system, under a unified serving stack that also compares LAFB with deployable popularity-oriented remedies. Results show that LAFB increases novel watch-time share and improves exposure for emerging creators and overall content diversity, while maintaining stable overall watch time and short-term satisfaction. LAFB has already been launched in the post-ranking stage of YouTube's recommendation system, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2026 (WWW '26), April 13-17, 2026, Dubai, UAE</p></details> |

Recently, driven by the strong generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based generative recommendation has become increasingly popular. However, we observe that existing methods inevitably introduce systematic bias when estimating item-level preference distributions. Specifically, autoregressive generation suffers from incomplete coverage due to beam search pruning, while parallel generation distorts probabilities by assuming token independence. We attribute this issue to a fundamental modeling mismatch: these methods approximate item-level distributions via token-level generation, which inherently induces approximation errors. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that token-level generation cannot faithfully substitute item-level generation, leading to biased item distributions. To address this, we propose \textbf{Sim}ply \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{R}ecommendation (\textbf{SimGR}), a framework that directly models item-level preference distributions in a shared latent space and ranks items by similarity, thereby aligning the modeling objective with recommendation and mitigating distributional distortion. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LLM backbones show that SimGR consistently outperforms existing generative recommenders.

While prior work emphasizes recommendation performance, the systemic risks of LLMs, such as bias and hallucination, and their propagation through feedback loops remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a role-aware, phase-wise diagnostic framework that traces how these risks emerge, manifest in ranking outcomes, and accumulate over repeated recommendation cycles. We formalize a controlled feedback-loop pipeline that simulates long-term interaction dynamics and enables empirical measurement of risks at the LLM-generated content, ranking, and ecosystem levels. Experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that LLM-based components can amplify popularity bias, introduce spurious signals through hallucination, and lead to polarized and self-reinforcing exposure patterns over time. We plan to release our framework as an open-source toolkit to facilitate systematic risk analysis across diverse LLM-powered recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

As recommender systems increasingly adopt Large Language Models (LLMs), creating unified, interpretable, and concise representations from heterogeneous sources becomes critical, especially for latency-sensitive online environments. In this work, we propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to synthesize a unified textual representation for each member. Our approach leverages implicit user engagement signals (e.g., clicks, applies) as the primary reward to distill salient information. Additionally, the framework is complemented by rule-based rewards that enforce formatting and length constraints. Extensive offline experiments across multiple LinkedIn products, one of the world's largest job platforms, demonstrate significant improvements in key downstream business metrics. This work provides a practical, labeling-free, and scalable solution for constructing interpretable user representations that are directly compatible with LLM-based systems.</p></details> |  |

Results reveal a critical divergence: while shallow models excelled in structural link prediction, R-GCN dominated semantic ranking. By leveraging relation-specific message passing, the deep model prioritizes pedagogical relevance over raw connectivity, resulting in superior, high-quality, domain-specific recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequences as Nodes for Contrastive Multimodal Graph Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07208v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To tackle cold-start and data sparsity issues in recommender systems, numerous multimodal, sequential, and contrastive techniques have been proposed. While these augmentations can boost recommendation performance, they tend to add noise and disrupt useful semantics. To address this, we propose MuSICRec (Multimodal Sequence-Item Contrastive Recommender), a multi-view graph-based recommender that combines collaborative, sequential, and multimodal signals. We build a sequence-item (SI) view by attention pooling over the user's interacted items to form sequence nodes. We propagate over the SI graph, obtaining a second view organically as an alternative to artificial data augmentation, while simultaneously injecting sequential context signals. Additionally, to mitigate modality noise and align the multimodal information, the contribution of text and visual features is modulated according to an ID-guided gate. We evaluate under a strict leave-two-out split against a broad range of sequential, multimodal, and contrastive baselines. On the Amazon Baby, Sports, and Electronics datasets, MuSICRec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all model types. We observe the largest gains for short-history users, mitigating sparsity and cold-start challenges. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MuSICRec-3CEE/ and will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSL: Understanding and Improving Softmax Recommender Systems with Competition-Aware Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07206v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Softmax Loss (SL) is being increasingly adopted for recommender systems (RS) as it has demonstrated better performance, robustness and fairness. Yet in implicit-feedback, a single global temperature and equal treatment of uniformly sampled negatives can lead to brittle training, because sampled sets may contain varying degrees of relevant or informative competitors. The optimal loss sharpness for a user-item pair with a particular set of negatives, can be suboptimal or destabilising for another with different negatives. We introduce Dual-scale Softmax Loss (DSL), which infers effective sharpness from the sampled competition itself. DSL adds two complementary branches to the log-sum-exp backbone. Firstly it reweights negatives within each training instance using hardness and item--item similarity, secondly it adapts a per-example temperature from the competition intensity over a constructed competitor slate. Together, these components preserve the geometry of SL while reshaping the competition distribution across negatives and across examples. Over several representative benchmarks and backbones, DSL yields substantial gains over strong baselines, with improvements over SL exceeding $10%$ in several settings and averaging $6.22%$ across datasets, metrics, and backbones. Under out-of-distribution (OOD) popularity shift, the gains are larger, with an average of $9.31%$ improvement over SL. We further provide a theoretical, distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) analysis, which demonstrates how DSL reshapes the robust payoff and the KL deviation for ambiguous instances. This helps explain the empirically observed improvements in accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Transformer-based SR methods, notably BERT4Rec, effectively capture these patterns but incur significant computational overhead due to extensive intermediate computations associated with Softmax-based attention. We propose Cotten4Rec, a novel SR model utilizing linear-time cosine similarity attention, implemented through a single optimized compute unified device architecture (CUDA) kernel. By minimizing intermediate buffers and kernel-launch overhead, Cotten4Rec substantially reduces resource usage compared to BERT4Rec and the linear-attention baseline, LinRec, especially for datasets with moderate sequence lengths and vocabulary sizes. Evaluations across three benchmark datasets confirm that Cotten4Rec achieves considerable reductions in memory and runtime with minimal compromise in recommendation accuracy, demonstrating Cotten4Rec's viability as an efficient alternative for practical, large-scale sequential recommendation scenarios where computational resources are critical.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Long-Term User Satisfaction in Interactive Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19585v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive recommender systems can dynamically adapt to user feedback, but often suffer from content homogeneity and filter bubble effects due to overfitting short-term user preferences. While recent efforts aim to improve content diversity, they predominantly operate in static or one-shot settings, neglecting the long-term evolution of user interests. Reinforcement learning provides a principled framework for optimizing long-term user satisfaction by modeling sequential decision-making processes. However, its application in recommendation is hindered by sparse, long-tailed user-item interactions and limited semantic planning capabilities. In this work, we propose LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (LERL), a novel hierarchical recommendation framework that integrates the semantic planning power of LLM with the fine-grained adaptability of RL. LERL consists of a high-level LLM-based planner that selects semantically diverse content categories, and a low-level RL policy that recommends personalized items within the selected semantic space. This hierarchical design narrows the action space, enhances planning efficiency, and mitigates overexposure to redundant content. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LERL significantly improves long-term user satisfaction when compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The implementation of LERL is available at https://github.com/1163710212/LERL.</p></details> |  |

We find that while cross-modal consensus often mitigates conventional poisoning that manipulates interaction logs or perturbs a single modality, it also introduces a new attack surface where synchronised multimodal poisoning can reliably steer fused representations along stable semantic directions during fine-tuning. To characterise this threat, we formalise cross-modal interactive poisoning and propose VENOMREC, which performs Exposure Alignment to identify high-exposure regions in the joint embedding space and Cross-modal Interactive Perturbation to craft attention-guided coupled token-patch edits. Experiments on three real-world multimodal datasets demonstrate that VENOMREC consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.73 mean ER@20 and improving over the strongest baseline by +0.52 absolute ER points on average, while maintaining comparable recommendation utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[RecoWorld: Building Simulated Environments for Agentic Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10397v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RecoWorld, a blueprint for building simulated environments tailored to agentic recommender systems. Such environments give agents a proper training space where they can learn from errors without impacting real users. RecoWorld distinguishes itself with a dual-view architecture: a simulated user and an agentic recommender engage in multi-turn interactions aimed at maximizing user retention. The user simulator reviews recommended items, updates its mindset, and when sensing potential user disengagement, generates reflective instructions. The agentic recommender adapts its recommendations by incorporating these user instructions and reasoning traces, creating a dynamic feedback loop that actively engages users. This process leverages the exceptional reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs. We explore diverse content representations within the simulator, including text-based, multimodal, and semantic ID modeling, and discuss how multi-turn RL enables the recommender to refine its strategies through iterative interactions. RecoWorld also supports multi-agent simulations, allowing creators to simulate the responses of targeted user populations. It marks an important first step toward recommender systems where users and agents collaboratively shape personalized information streams. We envision new interaction paradigms where "user instructs, recommender responds," jointly optimizing user retention and engagement.</p></details> | HCRS @ WWW 2026 |
| **[CFRecs: Counterfactual Recommendations on Real Estate User Listing Interaction Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05861v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured data is ubiquitous and powerful in representing complex relationships in many online platforms. While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used to learn from such data, counterfactual graph learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve model interpretability. Counterfactual explanation research focuses on identifying a counterfactual graph that is similar to the original but leads to different predictions. These explanations optimize two objectives simultaneously: the sparsity of changes in the counterfactual graph and the validity of its predictions. Building on these qualitative optimization goals, this paper introduces CFRecs, a novel framework that transforms counterfactual explanations into actionable insights. CFRecs employs a two-stage architecture consisting of a graph neural network (GNN) and a graph variational auto-encoder (Graph-VAE) to strategically propose minimal yet high-impact changes in graph structure and node attributes to drive desirable outcomes in recommender systems. We apply CFRecs to Zillow's graph-structured data to deliver actionable recommendations for both home buyers and sellers with the goal of helping them navigate the competitive housing market and achieve their homeownership goals. Experimental results on Zillow's user-listing interaction data demonstrate the effectiveness of CFRecs, which also provides a fresh perspective on recommendations using counterfactual reasoning in graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[GLASS: A Generative Recommender for Long-sequence Modeling via SID-Tier and Semantic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05663v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging long-term user behavioral patterns is a key trajectory for enhancing the accuracy of modern recommender systems. While generative recommender systems have emerged as a transformative paradigm, they face hurdles in effectively modeling extensive historical sequences. To address this challenge, we propose GLASS, a novel framework that integrates long-term user interests into the generative process via SID-Tier and Semantic Search. We first introduce SID-Tier, a module that maps long-term interactions into a unified interest vector to enhance the prediction of the initial SID token. Unlike traditional retrieval models that struggle with massive item spaces, SID-Tier leverages the compact nature of the semantic codebook to incorporate cross features between the user's long-term history and candidate semantic codes. Furthermore, we present semantic hard search, which utilizes generated coarse-grained semantic ID as dynamic keys to extract relevant historical behaviors, which are then fused via an adaptive gated fusion module to recalibrate the trajectory of subsequent fine-grained tokens. To address the inherent data sparsity in semantic hard search, we propose two strategies: semantic neighbor augmentation and codebook resizing. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets, TAOBAO-MM and KuaiRec, demonstrate that GLASS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant gains in recommendation quality. Our codes are made publicly available to facilitate further research in generative recommendation.</p></details> | 10 pages,3 figures |
| **[Reasoning-guided Collaborative Filtering with Language Models for Explainable Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05544v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit potential for explainable recommendation systems but overlook collaborative signals, while prevailing methods treat recommendation and explanation as separate tasks, resulting in a memory footprint. We present RGCF-XRec, a hybrid framework that introduces reasoning-guided collaborative filtering (CF) knowledge into a language model to deliver explainable sequential recommendations in a single step. Theoretical grounding and empirical findings reveal that RGCF-XRec offers three key merits over leading CF-aware LLM-based methods: (1) reasoning-guided augmentation of CF knowledge through contextual prompting to discover latent preferences and interpretable reasoning paths; (2) an efficient scoring mechanism based on four dimensions: coherence, completeness, relevance, and consistency to mitigate noisy CF reasoning traces and retain high-quality explanations; (3) a unified representation learning network that encodes collaborative and semantic signals, enabling a structured prompt to condition the LLM for explainable sequential recommendation. RGCF-XRec demonstrates consistent improvements across Amazon datasets, Sports, Toys, and Beauty, comprising 642,503 user-item interactions. It improves HR@10 by 7.38\% in Sports and 4.59\% in Toys, along with ROUGE-L by 8.02\% and 3.49\%, respectively. It reduces the cold warm performance gap, achieving overall gains of 14.5\% in cold-start and 11.9\% in warm start scenarios, and enhances zero-shot HR@5 by 18.54\% in Beauty and 23.16\% in Toys, highlighting effective generalization and robustness. Moreover, RGCF-XRec achieves training efficiency with a lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B backbone, ensuring scalability for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aspect-Aware MOOC Recommendation in a Heterogeneous Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05297v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MOOC recommendation systems have received increasing attention to help learners navigate and select preferred learning content. Traditional methods such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization. To alleviate these limitations, graph-based approaches have been proposed; however, they still rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which often capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts as well as significant engineering costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose AMR (Aspect-aware MOOC Recommendation), a novel framework that models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath. AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in the learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs to achieve fine-grained semantically informed KC recommendations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale MOOCCube and PEEK datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics such as HR@K and nDCG@K. Further analysis confirms that AMR effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information, allowing more accurate recommendations than those methods that rely solely on predefined metapaths. The code will be available upon accepted.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zenith: Scaling up Ranking Models for Billion-scale Livestreaming Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21285v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately capturing feature interactions is essential in recommender systems, and recent trends show that scaling up model capacity could be a key driver for next-level predictive performance. While prior work has explored various model architectures to capture multi-granularity feature interactions, relatively little attention has been paid to efficient feature handling and scaling model capacity without incurring excessive inference latency. In this paper, we address this by presenting Zenith, a scalable and efficient ranking architecture that learns complex feature interactions with minimal runtime overhead. Zenith is designed to handle a few high-dimensional Prime Tokens with Token Fusion and Token Boost modules, which exhibits superior scaling laws compared to other state-of-the-art ranking methods, thanks to its improved token heterogeneity. Its real-world effectiveness is demonstrated by deploying the architecture to TikTok Live, a leading online livestreaming platform that attracts billions of users globally. Our A/B test shows that Zenith achieves +1.05%/-1.10% in online CTR AUC and Logloss, and realizes +9.93% gains in Quality Watch Session / User and +8.11% in Quality Watch Duration / User.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Screening features low prevalence of relevant studies and scarce, costly expert decisions. Traditional active learning (AL) systems help, yet typically rely on fixed query strategies for selecting the next unlabeled documents. These static strategies do not adapt over time and ignore the relational structure of scientific literature networks. This thesis introduces AutoDiscover, a framework that reframes AL as an online decision-making problem driven by an adaptive agent. Literature is modeled as a heterogeneous graph capturing relationships among documents, authors, and metadata. A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) learns node representations, which a Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent uses to dynamically manage a portfolio of query strategies. With real-time human-in-the-loop labels, the agent balances exploration and exploitation under non-stationary review dynamics, where strategy utility changes over time. On the 26-dataset SYNERGY benchmark, AutoDiscover achieves higher screening efficiency than static AL baselines. Crucially, the agent mitigates cold start by bootstrapping discovery from minimal initial labels where static approaches fail. We also introduce TS-Insight, an open-source visual analytics dashboard to interpret, verify, and diagnose the agent's decisions. Together, these contributions accelerate SLR screening under scarce expert labels and low prevalence of relevant studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's Thesis, University of Luxembourg in collaboration with Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST).

| **[Sequential Diversification with Provable Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10944v3)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diversification is a useful tool for exploring large collections of information items. It has been used to reduce redundancy and cover multiple perspectives in information-search settings. Diversification finds applications in many different domains, including presenting search results of information-retrieval systems and selecting suggestions for recommender systems. Interestingly, existing measures of diversity are defined over \emph{sets} of items, rather than evaluating \emph{sequences} of items. This design choice comes in contrast with commonly-used relevance measures, which are distinctly defined over sequences of items, taking into account the ranking of items. The importance of employing sequential measures is that information items are almost always presented in a sequential manner, and during their information-exploration activity users tend to prioritize items with higher~ranking. In this paper, we study the problem of \emph{maximizing sequential diversity}. This is a new measure of \emph{diversity}, which accounts for the \emph{ranking} of the items, and incorporates \emph{item relevance} and \emph{user behavior}. The overarching framework can be instantiated with different diversity measures, and here we consider the measures of \emph{sum~diversity} and \emph{coverage~diversity}. The problem was recently proposed by Coppolillo et al.~\citep{coppolillo2024relevance}, where they introduce empirical methods that work well in practice. Our paper is a theoretical treatment of the problem: we establish the problem hardness and present algorithms with constant approximation guarantees for both diversity measures we consider. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our methods are competitive against strong baselines.</p></details> | WSDM 2025 |
| **[Agentic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (Agentic XAI) Approach To Explore Better Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21066v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.</p></details> |  |

They not only incorporate open-world knowledge from large language models (LLMs) but also compress the semantic space to reduce generation difficulty. However, existing methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) the lack of contextual awareness in generation tasks leads to a gap between the Semantic ID codebook space and the generation space, resulting in suboptimal recommendations; and (2) suboptimal quantization methods exacerbate semantic loss in LLMs. To address these issues, we propose Dual-Flow Orthogonal Semantic IDs (DOS) method. Specifically, DOS employs a user-item dual flow-framework that leverages collaborative signals to align the Semantic ID codebook space with the generation space. Furthermore, we introduce an orthogonal residual quantization scheme that rotates the semantic space to an appropriate orientation, thereby maximizing semantic preservation. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate the effectiveness of DOS. The proposed method has been successfully deployed in Meituan's mobile application, serving hundreds of millions of users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW2026 (short paper)</p></details> |

This paper introduces a method that generates personalized sequences of exercises by selecting, at each step, the exercise most likely to advance a learner's understanding of a targeted skill. The method uses information about the learner and their past performance to guide these choices, and learning progress is measured as the change in estimated skill level before and after each exercise. Using data from an online mathematics tutoring platform, we find that the approach recommends exercises associated with greater skill improvement and adapts effectively to differences across learners. From an instructional perspective, the framework enables personalized practice at scale, highlights exercises with consistently strong learning value, and helps instructors identify learners who may benefit from additional support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in INFORMS Transactions on Education</p></details> |
| **[OpenOneRec Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24762v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the OneRec series has successfully unified the fragmented recommendation pipeline into an end-to-end generative framework, a significant gap remains between recommendation systems and general intelligence. Constrained by isolated data, they operate as domain specialists-proficient in pattern matching but lacking world knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and instruction following. This limitation is further compounded by the lack of a holistic benchmark to evaluate such integrated capabilities. To address this, our contributions are: 1) RecIF Bench & Open Data: We propose RecIF-Bench, a holistic benchmark covering 8 diverse tasks that thoroughly evaluate capabilities from fundamental prediction to complex reasoning. Concurrently, we release a massive training dataset comprising 96 million interactions from 160,000 users to facilitate reproducible research. 2) Framework & Scaling: To ensure full reproducibility, we open-source our comprehensive training pipeline, encompassing data processing, co-pretraining, and post-training. Leveraging this framework, we demonstrate that recommendation capabilities can scale predictably while mitigating catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge. 3) OneRec-Foundation: We release OneRec Foundation (1.7B and 8B), a family of models establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across all tasks in RecIF-Bench. Furthermore, when transferred to the Amazon benchmark, our models surpass the strongest baselines with an average 26.8% improvement in Recall@10 across 10 diverse datasets (Figure 1). This work marks a step towards building truly intelligent recommender systems. Nonetheless, realizing this vision presents significant technical and theoretical challenges, highlighting the need for broader research engagement in this promising direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[MiniRec: Data-Efficient Reinforcement Learning for LLM-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04278v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of reinforcement learning (RL) into large language models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities for recommender systems by eliciting reasoning and improving user preference modeling. However, RL-based LLM recommendation faces significant efficiency challenges, making full-data training costly. Existing data selection methods define sample value based on learnability or representativeness, yet their loss- or gradient-driven or dataset coverage-driven criteria often misalign with RL learning dynamics, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose MiniRec, a data selection framework tailored for RL-based LLM recommendation. MiniRec evaluates sample learnability using key RL signals -- rewards -- pruning samples that are too easy (too high reward) or too difficult (consistently low reward). It assesses representativeness by aligning sample gradients with the approximated "ideal" global RL optimization trajectory, selecting samples that mainly drive model updates, and it also enforces diversity to reduce redundancy. Combined with a curriculum learning strategy from easy to hard samples, MiniRec significantly reduces training cost while largely preserving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate MiniRec's effectiveness, highlighting the importance of reward-aligned, trajectory-informed data selection in RL-based LLM recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Following the TRAIL: Predicting and Explaining Tomorrow's Hits with a Fine-Tuned LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04225v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely applied across multiple domains for their broad knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, applying them to recommendation systems is challenging since it is hard for LLMs to extract user preferences from large, sparse user-item logs, and real-time per-user ranking over the full catalog is too time-consuming to be practical. Moreover, many existing recommender systems focus solely on ranking items while overlooking explanations, which could help improve predictive accuracy and make recommendations more convincing to users. Inspired by recent works that achieve strong recommendation performance by forecasting near-term item popularity, we propose TRAIL (TRend and explAnation Integrated Learner). TRAIL is a fine-tuned LLM that jointly predicts short-term item popularity and generates faithful natural-language explanations. It employs contrastive learning with positive and negative pairs to align its scores and explanations with structured trend signals, yielding accurate and explainable popularity predictions. Extensive experiments show that TRAIL outperforms strong baselines and produces coherent, well-grounded explanations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCASRec: A Self-Correcting and Auto-Stopping Model for Generative Route List Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03324v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Route recommendation systems commonly adopt a multi-stage pipeline involving fine-ranking and re-ranking to produce high-quality ordered recommendations. However, this paradigm faces three critical limitations. First, there is a misalignment between offline training objectives and online metrics. Offline gains do not necessarily translate to online improvements. Actual performance must be validated through A/B testing, which may potentially compromise the user experience. Second, redundancy elimination relies on rigid, handcrafted rules that lack adaptability to the high variance in user intent and the unstructured complexity of real-world scenarios. Third, the strict separation between fine-ranking and re-ranking stages leads to sub-optimal performance. Since each module is optimized in isolation, the fine-ranking stage remains oblivious to the list-level objectives (e.g., diversity) targeted by the re-ranker, thereby preventing the system from achieving a jointly optimized global optimum. To overcome these intertwined challenges, we propose SCASRec (Self-Correcting and Auto-Stopping Recommendation), a unified generative framework that integrates ranking and redundancy elimination into a single end-to-end process. SCASRec introduces a stepwise corrective reward (SCR) to guide list-wise refinement by focusing on hard samples, and employs a learnable End-of-Recommendation (EOR) token to terminate generation adaptively when no further improvement is expected. Experiments on two large-scale, open-sourced route recommendation datasets demonstrate that SCASRec establishes an SOTA in offline and online settings. SCASRec has been fully deployed in a real-world navigation app, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

This problem consists of an important generalization of the Matrix Completion problem, a central problem in Statistics, Operations Research and Machine Learning, that arises in applications such as recommendation systems, signal processing, system identification and image denoising. We formalize this problem as an optimization problem with an objective that balances the strength of the fit of the reconstruction to the observed entries with the ability of the reconstruction to be predictive of the side information. We derive a mixed-projection reformulation of the resulting optimization problem and present a strong semidefinite cone relaxation. We design an efficient, scalable alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm that produces high quality feasible solutions to the problem of interest. Our numerical results demonstrate that in the small rank regime ({\color{black}$k \leq 10$}), our algorithm outputs solutions that achieve on average {\color{black}$2.3\%$} lower objective value and {\color{black}$41\%$} lower $\ell_2$ reconstruction error than the solutions returned by the best performing benchmark method on synthetic data. The runtime of our algorithm is competitive with and often superior to that of the benchmark methods. Our algorithm is able to solve problems with $n = 10000$ rows and $m = 10000$ columns in less than a minute. On large scale real world data, our algorithm produces solutions that achieve $67\%$ lower out of sample error than benchmark methods in $97\%$ less execution time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Dynamic Embedding Size Search for Streaming Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15411v4)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems typically represent users and items by learning their embeddings, which are usually set to uniform dimensions and dominate the model parameters. However, real-world recommender systems often operate in streaming recommendation scenarios, where the number of users and items continues to grow, leading to substantial storage resource consumption for these embeddings. Although a few methods attempt to mitigate this by employing embedding size search strategies to assign different embedding dimensions in streaming recommendations, they assume that the embedding size grows with the frequency of users/items, which eventually still exceeds the predefined memory budget over time. To address this issue, this paper proposes to learn Scalable Lightweight Embeddings for streaming recommendation, called SCALL, which can adaptively adjust the embedding sizes of users/items within a given memory budget over time. Specifically, we propose to sample embedding sizes from a probabilistic distribution, with the guarantee to meet any predefined memory budget. By fixing the memory budget, the proposed embedding size sampling strategy can increase and decrease the embedding sizes in accordance to the frequency of the corresponding users or items. Furthermore, we develop a reinforcement learning-based search paradigm that models each state with mean pooling to keep the length of the state vectors fixed, invariant to the changing number of users and items. As a result, the proposed method can provide embedding sizes to unseen users and items. Comprehensive empirical evaluations on two public datasets affirm the advantageous effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2024 Code is available at https://github.com/qykcq/Scalable-Dynamic-Embedding-Size-Search-for-Streaming-Recommendation</p></details> |
| **[Budgeted Embedding Table For Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14884v8)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At the heart of contemporary recommender systems (RSs) are latent factor models that provide quality recommendation experience to users. These models use embedding vectors, which are typically of a uniform and fixed size, to represent users and items. As the number of users and items continues to grow, this design becomes inefficient and hard to scale. Recent lightweight embedding methods have enabled different users and items to have diverse embedding sizes, but are commonly subject to two major drawbacks. Firstly, they limit the embedding size search to optimizing a heuristic balancing the recommendation quality and the memory complexity, where the trade-off coefficient needs to be manually tuned for every memory budget requested. The implicitly enforced memory complexity term can even fail to cap the parameter usage, making the resultant embedding table fail to meet the memory budget strictly. Secondly, most solutions, especially reinforcement learning based ones derive and optimize the embedding size for each each user/item on an instance-by-instance basis, which impedes the search efficiency. In this paper, we propose Budgeted Embedding Table (BET), a novel method that generates table-level actions (i.e., embedding sizes for all users and items) that is guaranteed to meet pre-specified memory budgets. Furthermore, by leveraging a set-based action formulation and engaging set representation learning, we present an innovative action search strategy powered by an action fitness predictor that efficiently evaluates each table-level action. Experiments have shown state-of-the-art performance on two real-world datasets when BET is paired with three popular recommender models under different memory budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WSDM 2024.

To avoid the significant memory overhead of storing large item sets, the generative recommendation paradigm instead models each item as a series of discrete semantic codes. Here, the next item is predicted by an autoregressive model that generates the code sequence corresponding to the predicted item. However, despite promising ranking capabilities on small datasets, these methods have yet to surpass traditional sequential recommenders on large item sets, limiting their adoption in the very scenarios they were designed to address. To resolve this, we propose MSCGRec, a Multimodal Semantic and Collaborative Generative Recommender. MSCGRec incorporates multiple semantic modalities and introduces a novel self-supervised quantization learning approach for images based on the DINO framework. Additionally, MSCGRec fuses collaborative and semantic signals by extracting collaborative features from sequential recommenders and treating them as a separate modality. Finally, we propose constrained sequence learning that restricts the large output space during training to the set of permissible tokens. We empirically demonstrate on three large real-world datasets that MSCGRec outperforms both sequential and generative recommendation baselines and provide an extensive ablation study to validate the impact of each component.</p></details> |  |
| **[BlossomRec: Block-level Fused Sparse Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13368v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer structures have been widely used in sequential recommender systems (SRS). However, as user interaction histories increase, computational time and memory requirements also grow. This is mainly caused by the standard attention mechanism. Although there exist many methods employing efficient attention and SSM-based models, these approaches struggle to effectively model long sequences and may exhibit unstable performance on short sequences. To address these challenges, we design a sparse attention mechanism, BlossomRec, which models both long-term and short-term user interests through attention computation to achieve stable performance across sequences of varying lengths. Specifically, we categorize user interests in recommendation systems into long-term and short-term interests, and compute them using two distinct sparse attention patterns, with the results combined through a learnable gated output. Theoretically, it significantly reduces the number of interactions participating in attention computation. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BlossomRec, when integrated with state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, achieves comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing memory usage, providing strong evidence of BlossomRec's efficiency and effectiveness.

However, existing methods predominantly rely on user-item-outfit interaction behaviors while overlooking explicit representations of clothing aesthetics. To bridge this gap, we present the AesRec benchmark dataset featuring systematic quantitative aesthetic annotations, thereby enabling the development of aesthetics-aligned recommendation systems. Grounded in professional apparel quality standards and fashion aesthetic principles, we define a multidimensional set of indicators. At the item level, six dimensions are independently assessed: silhouette, chromaticity, materiality, craftsmanship, wearability, and item-level impression. Transitioning to the outfit level, the evaluation retains the first five core attributes while introducing stylistic synergy, visual harmony, and outfit-level impression as distinct metrics to capture the collective aesthetic impact. Given the increasing human-like proficiency of Vision-Language Models in multimodal understanding and interaction, we leverage them for large-scale aesthetic scoring. We conduct rigorous human-machine consistency validation on a fashion dataset, confirming the reliability of the generated ratings.

| **[NEZHA: A Zero-sacrifice and Hyperspeed Decoding Architecture for Generative Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18793v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Recommendation (GR), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a promising new paradigm for industrial recommender systems. However, their practical application is severely hindered by high inference latency, which makes them infeasible for high-throughput, real-time services and limits their overall business impact. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has been proposed to accelerate the autoregressive generation process, existing implementations introduce new bottlenecks: they typically require separate draft models and model-based verifiers, requiring additional training and increasing the latency overhead. In this paper, we address these challenges with NEZHA, a novel architecture that achieves hyperspeed decoding for GR systems without sacrificing recommendation quality. Specifically, NEZHA integrates a nimble autoregressive draft head directly into the primary model, enabling efficient self-drafting. This design, combined with a specialized input prompt structure, preserves the integrity of sequence-to-sequence generation. Furthermore, to tackle the critical problem of hallucination, a major source of performance degradation, we introduce an efficient, model-free verifier based on a hash set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NEZHA through extensive experiments on public datasets and have successfully deployed the system on Taobao since October 2025, driving the billion-level advertising revenue and serving hundreds of millions of daily active users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Full Candidate Interaction: A Comprehensive Comparison Network for Better Route Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08745v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Route Recommendation (RR) is a core task in route planning within online navigation applications, aiming to recommend the optimal route among candidate routes to users. Industrially, RR adopts the two-stage recall-and-rank framework instead of traditional route planning algorithms primarily for computational efficiency. However, RR fundamentally differs from traditional recommendation systems that follow this paradigm. First, a primary challenge is that route items cannot be assigned unique identifiers. Additionally, RR fundamentally differs from traditional recommendation systems in its approach to feature interaction. These differences render conventional recommendation approaches inadequate for route recommendation scenarios, necessitating specialized methods that can effectively handle route-specific challenges. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called Comprehensive Comparison Network (CCN) for route recommendation. CCN constructs comparative features by comparing non-overlapping segments between route pairs, enabling difference learning without the infinite scalability issues of ID embeddings. Furthermore, CCN employs a specially designed Comprehensive Comparison Block (CCB) that differs from previous item attention methods to achieve effective cross-interaction between routes using comparison-level features. Moreover, we develop an interpretable Pair Scoring Network (PSN) for route recommendation and introduce a more comprehensive route recommendation dataset to advance research in this field. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and CCN has been successfully deployed in AMAP for over a year, demonstrating its value in route recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[RobustExplain: Evaluating Robustness of LLM-Based Explanation Agents for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19120v3)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate natural-language explanations in recommender systems, acting as explanation agents that reason over user behavior histories. While prior work has focused on explanation fluency and relevance under fixed inputs, the robustness of LLM-generated explanations to realistic user behavior noise remains largely unexplored. In real-world web platforms, interaction histories are inherently noisy due to accidental clicks, temporal inconsistencies, missing values, and evolving preferences, raising concerns about explanation stability and user trust. We present RobustExplain, the first systematic evaluation framework for measuring the robustness of LLM-generated recommendation explanations. RobustExplain introduces five realistic user behavior perturbations evaluated across multiple severity levels and a multi-dimensional robustness metric capturing semantic, keyword, structural, and length consistency. Our goal is to establish a principled, task-level evaluation framework and initial robustness baselines, rather than to provide a comprehensive leaderboard across all available LLMs. Experiments on four representative LLMs (7B--70B) show that current models exhibit only moderate robustness, with larger models achieving up to 8% higher stability. Our results establish the first robustness benchmarks for explanation agents and highlight robustness as a critical dimension for trustworthy, agent-driven recommender systems at web scale.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

For example, an e-commerce platform may require every recommendation list to include items from multiple sellers and at least one newly listed product; violating such constraints--even once--is unacceptable in production. Prior work on multi-objective recommendation and recent LLM-based recommender agents largely treat constraints as soft penalties or focus on item scoring and interaction, leading to frequent violations in real-world deployments. How to leverage LLMs for coordinating constrained optimization in recommendation systems remains underexplored. We propose DualAgent-Rec, an LLM-coordinated dual-agent framework for constrained multi-objective e-commerce recommendation. The framework separates optimization into an Exploitation Agent that prioritizes accuracy under hard constraints and an Exploration Agent that promotes diversity through unconstrained Pareto search. An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs. These results indicate that LLMs can act as effective orchestration agents for deployable and constraint-compliant recommendation systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14330v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition (GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches.

We consider a contextual multi-armed bandit recommendation algorithm that learns optimal product recommendations based on user and product attributes. It is well known that the sequence of recommendations affects user preferences. However, typical learning algorithms treat the user attributes as static and disregard the impact of their recommendations on user preferences. Our interest is to analyze the effect of this mismatch between the model assumption of a static environment and the reality of an evolving environment affected by the recommendations. To perform this analysis, we introduce a model for the coupled evolution of a linear bandit recommendation system and its users, whose preferences are drawn towards the recommendations made by the algorithm. We describe a method, that is grounded in stochastic approximation theory, to come up with a dynamical system model that asymptotically approximates the mean behavior of the stochastic model. The resulting dynamical system captures the coupled evolution of the population preferences and the learning algorithm. Analyzing this dynamical system gives insight into the long-term properties of user preferences and the learning algorithm. Under certain conditions, we show that the RS is able to learn the population preferences in spite of the model mismatch. We discuss and characterize the relation between various parameters of the model and the long term preferences of users in this work. A key observation is that the exploration-exploitation tradeoff used by the recommendation algorithm significantly affects the long term preferences of users. Algorithms that exploit more can polarize user preferences, leading to the well-known filter bubble phenomenon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Generative Recommender Tokenizer: Recsys-Native Encoding and Semantic Quantization Beyond LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02338v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic ID (SID)-based recommendation is a promising paradigm for scaling sequential recommender systems, but existing methods largely follow a semantic-centric pipeline: item embeddings are learned from foundation models and discretized using generic quantization schemes. This design is misaligned with generative recommendation objectives: semantic embeddings are weakly coupled with collaborative prediction, and generic quantization is inefficient at reducing sequential uncertainty for autoregressive modeling. To address these, we propose ReSID, a recommendation-native, principled SID framework that rethinks representation learning and quantization from the perspective of information preservation and sequential predictability, without relying on LLMs. ReSID consists of two components: (i) Field-Aware Masked Auto-Encoding (FAMAE), which learns predictive-sufficient item representations from structured features, and (ii) Globally Aligned Orthogonal Quantization (GAOQ), which produces compact and predictable SID sequences by jointly reducing semantic ambiguity and prefix-conditional uncertainty. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across ten datasets show the effectiveness of ReSID. ReSID consistently outperforms strong sequential and SID-based generative baselines by an average of over 10%, while reducing tokenization cost by up to 122x. Code is available at https://github.com/FuCongResearchSquad/ReSID.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recommender system in X inadvertently profiles ideological positions of users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02624v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studies on recommendations in social media have mainly analyzed the quality of recommended items (e.g., their diversity or biases) and the impact of recommendation policies (e.g., in comparison with purely chronological policies). We use a data donation program, collecting more than 2.5 million friend recommendations made to 682 volunteers on X over a year, to study instead how real-world recommenders learn, represent and process political and social attributes of users inside the so-called black boxes of AI systems. Using publicly available knowledge on the architecture of the recommender, we inferred the positions of recommended users in its embedding space. Leveraging ideology scaling calibrated with political survey data, we analyzed the political position of users in our study (N=26,509 among volunteers and recommended contacts) among several attributes, including age and gender. Our results show that the platform's recommender system produces a spatial ordering of users that is highly correlated with their Left-Right positions (Pearson rho=0.887, p-value < 0.0001), and that cannot be explained by socio-demographic attributes. These results open new possibilities for studying the interaction between human and AI systems. They also raise important questions linked to the legal definition of algorithmic profiling in data privacy regulation by blurring the line between active and passive profiling. We explore new constrained recommendation methods enabled by our results, limiting the political information in the recommender as a potential tool for privacy compliance capable of preserving recommendation relevance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Quality-Diversity Trade-offs for Large-Scale Batch Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02024v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core research question in recommender systems is to propose batches of highly relevant and diverse items, that is, items personalized to the user's preferences, but which also might get the user out of their comfort zone. This diversity might induce properties of serendipidity and novelty which might increase user engagement or revenue. However, many real-life problems arise in that case: e.g., avoiding to recommend distinct but too similar items to reduce the churn risk, and computational cost for large item libraries, up to millions of items. First, we consider the case when the user feedback model is perfectly observed and known in advance, and introduce an efficient algorithm called B-DivRec combining determinantal point processes and a fuzzy denuding procedure to adjust the degree of item diversity. This helps enforcing a quality-diversity trade-off throughout the user history. Second, we propose an approach to adaptively tailor the quality-diversity trade-off to the user, so that diversity in recommendations can be enhanced if it leads to positive feedback, and vice-versa. Finally, we illustrate the performance and versatility of B-DivRec in the two settings on synthetic and real-life data sets on movie recommendation and drug repurposing.</p></details> |  |

These environments can include factors such as sensor drift, changing user behavior, device aging, and adversarial dynamics. Contrastive continual learning (CCL) combines contrastive representation learning with incremental adaptation, enabling robust feature reuse across tasks and domains. However, the geometric nature of contrastive objectives, when paired with replay-based rehearsal and stability-preserving regularization, introduces new security vulnerabilities. Notably, backdoor attacks can exploit embedding alignment and replay reinforcement, enabling the implantation of persistent malicious behaviors that endure through updates and deployment cycles. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on CCL within IoT systems. We formalize the objectives of embedding-level attacks, examine persistence mechanisms unique to IoT deployments, and develop a layered taxonomy tailored to IoT. Additionally, we compare vulnerabilities across various learning paradigms and evaluate defense strategies under IoT constraints, including limited memory, edge computing, and federated aggregation. Our findings indicate that while CCL is effective for enhancing adaptive IoT intelligence, it may also elevate long-lived representation-level threats if not adequately secured.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Spectral Graph Representation Learning for Multi-label Abnormality Analysis from 3D CT Scans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10779v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload. Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work of academic research, we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation and abdominal CT data.</p></details> | 28 pages, 16 figures |

Recognizing the current scarcity of dedicated datasets in this domain, we introduce EPRBench, a high-quality benchmark specifically designed for event stream-based VPR. EPRBench comprises 10K event sequences and 65K event frames, collected using both handheld and vehicle-mounted setups to comprehensively capture real-world challenges across diverse viewpoints, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios. To support semantic-aware and language-integrated VPR research, we provide LLM-generated scene descriptions, subsequently refined through human annotation, establishing a solid foundation for integrating LLMs into event-based perception pipelines. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we implement and benchmark 15 state-of-the-art VPR algorithms on EPRBench, offering a strong baseline for future algorithmic comparisons. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion paradigm for VPR: leveraging LLMs to generate textual scene descriptions from raw event streams, which then guide spatially attentive token selection, cross-modal feature fusion, and multi-scale representation learning. This framework not only achieves highly accurate place recognition but also produces interpretable reasoning processes alongside its predictions, significantly enhancing model transparency and explainability. The dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Neuromorphic_ReID</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Representation Learning for Weighting Problems in Design-Based Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16407v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reweighting a distribution to minimize a distance to a target distribution is a powerful and flexible strategy for estimating a wide range of causal effects, but can be challenging in practice because optimal weights typically depend on knowledge of the underlying data generating process. In this paper, we focus on design-based weights, which do not incorporate outcome information; prominent examples include prospective cohort studies, survey weighting, and the weighting portion of augmented weighting estimators. In such applications, we explore the central role of representation learning in finding desirable weights in practice. Unlike the common approach of assuming a well-specified representation, we highlight the error due to the choice of a representation and outline a general framework for finding suitable representations that minimize this error. Building on recent work that combines balancing weights and neural networks, we propose an end-to-end estimation procedure that learns a flexible representation, while retaining promising theoretical properties. We show that this approach is competitive in a range of common causal inference tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Refer...</summary><p>Reference to erroneous result from Clivio et al.

To address this gap, we introduce 3DLAND, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising over 6,000 contrast-enhanced CT volumes with over 20,000 high-fidelity 3D lesion annotations linked to seven abdominal organs: liver, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, stomach, and gallbladder. Our streamlined three-phase pipeline integrates automated spatial reasoning, prompt-optimized 2D segmentation, and memory-guided 3D propagation, validated by expert radiologists with surface dice scores exceeding 0.75. By providing diverse lesion types and patient demographics, 3DLAND enables scalable evaluation of anomaly detection, localization, and cross-organ transfer learning for medical AI. Our dataset establishes a new benchmark for evaluating organ-aware 3D segmentation models, paving the way for advancements in healthcare-oriented AI.

| **[AIWizards at MULTIPRIDE: A Hierarchical Approach to Slur Reclamation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12818v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting reclaimed slurs represents a fundamental challenge for hate speech detection systems, as the same lexcal items can function either as abusive expressions or as in-group affirmations depending on social identity and context. In this work, we address Subtask B of the MultiPRIDE shared task at EVALITA 2026 by proposing a hierarchical approach to modeling the slur reclamation process. Our core assumption is that members of the LGBTQ+ community are more likely, on average, to employ certain slurs in a eclamatory manner. Based on this hypothesis, we decompose the task into two stages. First, using a weakly supervised LLM-based annotation, we assign fuzzy labels to users indicating the likelihood of belonging to the LGBTQ+ community, inferred from the tweet and the user bio. These soft labels are then used to train a BERT-like model to predict community membership, encouraging the model to learn latent representations associated with LGBTQ+ identity. In the second stage, we integrate this latent space with a newly initialized model for the downstream slur reclamation detection task. The intuition is that the first model encodes user-oriented sociolinguistic signals, which are then fused with representations learned by a model pretrained for hate speech detection. Experimental results on Italian and Spanish show that our approach achieves performance statistically comparable to a strong BERT-based baseline, while providing a modular and extensible framework for incorporating sociolinguistic context into hate speech modeling. We argue that more fine-grained hierarchical modeling of user identity and discourse context may further improve the detection of reclaimed language. We release our code at https://github.com/LucaTedeschini/multipride.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Multiple Foundation Models for Advanced Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00736v4)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have substantially advanced computational pathology by learning transferable visual representations from large histological datasets, yet their performance varies widely across tasks due to differences in training data composition and reliance on proprietary datasets that cannot be cumulatively expanded. Existing efforts to combine foundation models through offline distillation partially mitigate this issue but require dedicated distillation data and repeated retraining to integrate new models. Here we present Shazam, an online integration model that adaptively combines multiple pretrained pathology foundation models within a unified and scalable representation learning paradigm. Our findings show that fusing multi-level features through adaptive expert weighting and online distillation enables efficient consolidation of complementary model strengths without additional pretraining. Across spatial transcriptomics prediction, survival prognosis, tile-level classification, and visual question answering, Shazam consistently outperforms strong individual models, demonstrating that online model integration provides a practical and extensible strategy for advancing computational pathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 5 main figures</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we present a novel model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that unifies joint state-action representation learning with imaginative roll-outs. We design a world model trained with variational auto-encoders and augment the model using the state-action learned embedding (SALE). SALE is injected into both the imagination module that forecasts plausible future roll-outs and the joint agent network whose individual action values are combined through a mixing network to estimate the joint action-value function. By coupling imagined trajectories with SALE-based action values, the agents acquire a richer understanding of how their choices influence collective outcomes, leading to improved long-term planning and optimization under limited real-environment interactions. Empirical studies on well-established multi-agent benchmarks, including StarCraft II Micro-Management, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, and Level-Based Foraging challenges, demonstrate consistent gains of our method over baseline algorithms and highlight the effectiveness of joint state-action learned embeddings within a multi-agent model-based paradigm.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Quasiparticle Interference Kernel Extraction with Variational Autoencoders via Latent Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05325v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem, because many different kernels can combine to produce almost the same observed image, and noise or overlaps further obscure the true signal. Existing solutions to this extraction problem rely on manually zooming into small local regions with isolated single-scatterers. This is infeasible for real cases where scattering conditions are too complex. In this work, we propose the first AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction, which models the space of physically valid kernels and uses this knowledge to guide the inverse mapping. We introduce a two-step learning strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the model to infer kernels robustly under complex, entangled scattering conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly higher extraction accuracy, improved generalization to unseen kernels. To further validate its effectiveness, we also apply the method to real QPI data from Ag and FeSe samples, where it reliably extracts meaningful kernels under complex scattering conditions.</p></details> |  |

Despite their effectiveness, they suffer from two significant limitations. First, the quadratic computational complexity of multi-head self-attention (MHSA), which restricts scalability to large token counts, and second, a high dependency on large-scale training data to attain competitive performance. In this paper, to address these challenges, we propose a novel sparse self-attention mechanism named Fibottention. Fibottention employs structured sparsity patterns derived from the Wythoff array, enabling an $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ computational complexity in self-attention. By design, its sparsity patterns vary across attention heads, which provably reduces redundant pairwise interactions while ensuring sufficient and diverse coverage. This leads to an \emph{inception-like functional diversity} in the attention heads, and promotes more informative and disentangled representations. We integrate Fibottention into standard Transformer architectures and conduct extensive experiments across multiple domains, including image classification, video understanding, and robot learning. Results demonstrate that models equipped with Fibottention either significantly outperform or achieve on-par performance with their dense MHSA counterparts, while leveraging only $2\%$ of all pairwise interactions across self-attention heads in typical settings, $2-6\%$ of the pairwise interactions in self-attention heads, resulting in substantial computational savings. Moreover, when compared to existing sparse attention mechanisms, Fibottention consistently achieves superior results on a FLOP-equivalency basis. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the enhanced feature diversity resulting from our attention design and discuss its implications for efficient representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The complete implementation, including source code and evaluation scripts, is publicly available at: https://github.com/Charlotte-CharMLab/Fibottention</p></details> |

Specifically, SSL extracts the representation from massive unlabeled data, which will be transferred to a plenty of down streaming tasks with limited data. The significant improvement on diverse applications of representation learning has attracted increasing attention, resulting in a variety of dramatically different self-supervised learning objectives for representation extraction, with an assortment of learning procedures, but the lack of a clear and unified understanding. Such an absence hampers the ongoing development of representation learning, leaving a theoretical understanding missing, principles for efficient algorithm design unclear, and the use of representation learning methods in practice unjustified. The urgency for a unified framework is further motivated by the rapid growth in representation learning methods. In this paper, we are therefore compelled to develop a principled foundation of representation learning. We first theoretically investigate the sufficiency of the representation from a spectral representation view, which reveals the spectral essence of the existing successful SSL algorithms and paves the path to a unified framework for understanding and analysis. Such a framework work also inspires the development of more efficient and easy-to-use representation learning algorithms with principled way in real-world applications.</p></details> | 43 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning via Flow-Guided Neural Operator on Time-Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12267v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful paradigm for learning from unlabeled time-series data. However, popular methods such as masked autoencoders (MAEs) rely on reconstructing inputs from a fixed, predetermined masking ratio. Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. To achieve this, we introduce the Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel framework combining operator learning with flow matching for SSL training. FGNO learns mappings in functional spaces by using Short-Time Fourier Transform to unify different time resolutions. We extract a rich hierarchy of features by tapping into different network layers and flow times that apply varying strengths of noise to the input data. This enables the extraction of versatile representations, from low-level patterns to high-level global features, using a single model adaptable to specific tasks. Unlike prior generative SSL methods that use noisy inputs during inference, we propose using clean inputs for representation extraction while learning representations with noise; this eliminates randomness and boosts accuracy. We evaluate FGNO across three biomedical domains, where it consistently outperforms established baselines. Our method yields up to 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding (BrainTreeBank), 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction (DREAMT), and over 20% improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 on SleepEDF under low-data regimes. These results highlight FGNO's robustness to data scarcity and its superior capacity to learn expressive representations for diverse time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Free Lunch in Medical Image Foundation Model Pre-training via Randomized Synthesis and Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12317v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image foundation models (MIFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for a wide range of clinical tasks, yet their development is constrained by the scarcity, heterogeneity, and high cost of large-scale annotated datasets. Here, we propose RaSD (Randomized Synthesis and Disentanglement), a scalable framework for pre-training MIFMs entirely on synthetic data. By modeling anatomical structures and appearance variations with randomized Gaussian distributions, RaSD exposes models to sufficient multi-scale structural and appearance perturbations, forcing them to rely on invariant and task-relevant anatomical cues rather than dataset-specific textures, thereby enabling robust and transferable representation learning. We pre-trained RaSD on 1.2 million 3D volumes and 9.6 million 2D images, and extensively evaluated the resulting models across 6 imaging modalities, 48 datasets, and 56 downstream tasks. Across all evaluated downstream tasks, RaSD consistently outperforms training-from-scratch models, achieves the best performance on 17 tasks, and remains comparable to models pre-trained on large real datasets in most others. These results demonstrate that the capacity of synthetic data alone to drive robust representation learning. Our findings establish a paradigm shift in medical AI, demonstrating that synthetic data can serve as a "free lunch" for scalable, privacy-preserving, and clinically generalizable foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, recent work has raised concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which characteristics of the underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating eight models on their ability to capture eight fundamental characteristics related to the link structure of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density, temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well models learn these characteristics. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models capture some characteristics well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical insights for the application of temporal graph learning models and motivate more interpretability-driven evaluations in graph learning research.</p></details> |  |
| **[EEG-to-Gait Decoding via Phase-Aware Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22488v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate decoding of lower-limb motion from EEG signals is essential for advancing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications in movement intent recognition and control. This study presents NeuroDyGait, a two-stage, phase-aware EEG-to-gait decoding framework that explicitly models temporal continuity and domain relationships. To address challenges of causal, phase-consistent prediction and cross-subject variability, Stage I learns semantically aligned EEG-motion embeddings via relative contrastive learning with a cross-attention-based metric, while Stage II performs domain relation-aware decoding through dynamic fusion of session-specific heads. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (GED and FMD) show substantial gains over baselines, including a recent 2025 model EEG2GAIT. The framework generalizes to unseen subjects and maintains inference latency below 5 ms per window, satisfying real-time BCI requirements. Visualization of learned attention and phase-specific cortical saliency maps further reveals interpretable neural correlates of gait phases. Future extensions will target rehabilitation populations and multimodal integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-Enhanced Temporal Embeddings via a Hybrid Seq2Seq Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11578v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates how shallow, NISQ-compatible quantum layers can improve temporal representation learning in real-world sequential data. We develop a QLSTM Seq2Seq autoencoder in which a depth-1 variational quantum circuit is embedded inside each recurrent gate, shaping the geometry of the learned latent manifold. Evaluated on fourteen rolling S and P 500 windows from 2022 to 2025, the quantum-enhanced encoder produces smoother trajectories, clearer regime transitions, and more stable, sector-coherent clusters than a classical LSTM baseline. These geometric properties support the use of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel for downstream portfolio allocation, where both RBF-Graph and RBF-DivMom strategies consistently outperform their classical counterparts in risk-adjusted terms. Analysis across periods shows that compressed manifolds favor concentrated allocation, while dispersed manifolds favor diversification, demonstrating that latent geometry serves as a regime indicator. The results highlight a practical role for shallow hybrid quantum and classical layers in NISQ-era sequence modeling, offering a reproducible pathway for improving temporal embeddings in finance and other data-limited, noise-sensitive domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning with Blockwise Missingness and Signal Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11511v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified representation learning for multi-source data integration faces two important challenges: blockwise missingness and blockwise signal heterogeneity. The former arises from sources observing different, yet potentially overlapping, feature sets, while the latter involves varying signal strengths across subject groups and feature sets. While existing methods perform well with fully observed data or uniform signal strength, their performance degenerates when these two challenges coincide, which is common in practice. To address this, we propose Anchor Projected Principal Component Analysis (APPCA), a general framework for representation learning with structured blockwise missingness that is robust to signal heterogeneity. APPCA first recovers robust group-specific column spaces using all observed feature sets, and then aligns them by projecting shared "anchor" features onto these subspaces before performing PCA. This projection step induces a significant denoising effect. We establish estimation error bounds for embedding reconstruction through a fine-grained perturbation analysis. In particular, using a novel spectral slicing technique, our bound eliminates the standard dependency on the signal strength of subject embeddings, relying instead solely on the signal strength of integrated feature sets. We validate the proposed method through extensive simulation studies and an application to multimodal single-cell sequencing data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning for Histopathology Patch Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09477v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) provide gigapixel-scale high-resolution images that are highly useful for disease diagnosis. However, digital histopathology image analysis faces significant challenges due to the limited training labels, since manually annotating specific regions or small patches cropped from large WSIs requires substantial time and effort. Weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a practical and efficient solution by requiring only bag-level (slide-level) labels, while each bag typically contains multiple instances (patches). Most MIL methods directly use frozen image patch features generated by various image encoders as inputs and primarily focus on feature aggregation. However, feature representation learning for encoder pretraining in MIL settings has largely been neglected. In our work, we propose a novel feature representation learning framework called weakly supervised contrastive learning (WeakSupCon) that incorporates bag-level label information during training. Our method does not rely on instance-level pseudo-labeling, yet it effectively separates patches with different labels in the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that the image features generated by our WeakSupCon method lead to improved downstream MIL performance compared to self-supervised contrastive learning approaches in three datasets. Our related code is available at github.com/BzhangURU/Paper_WeakSupCon_for_MIL</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Really Learn One Representation to Optimize All Rewards?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11399v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As machine learning has moved towards leveraging large models as priors for downstream tasks, the community has debated the right form of prior for solving reinforcement learning (RL) problems. If one were to try to prefetch as much computation as possible, they would attempt to learn a prior over the policies for some yet-to-be-determined reward function. Recent work (forward-backward (FB) representation learning) has tried this, arguing that an unsupervised representation learning procedure can enable optimal control over arbitrary rewards without further fine-tuning. However, FB's training objective and learning behavior remain mysterious. In this paper, we demystify FB by clarifying when such representations can exist, what its objective optimizes, and how it converges in practice. We draw connections with rank matching, fitted Q-evaluation, and contraction mapping. Our analysis suggests a simplified unsupervised pre-training method for RL that, instead of enabling optimal control, performs one step of policy improvement. We call our proposed method $\textbf{one-step forward-backward representation learning (one-step FB)}$. Experiments in didactic settings, as well as in $10$ state-based and image-based continuous control domains, demonstrate that one-step FB converges to errors $10^5$ smaller and improves zero-shot performance by $+24\%$ on average.

| **[MOTGNN: Interpretable Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Omics Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07465v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating multi-omics data, such as DNA methylation, mRNA expression, and microRNA (miRNA) expression, offers a comprehensive view of the biological mechanisms underlying disease. However, the high dimensionality of multi-omics data, the heterogeneity across modalities, and the lack of reliable biological interaction networks make meaningful integration challenging. In addition, many existing models rely on handcrafted similarity graphs, are vulnerable to class imbalance, and often lack built-in interpretability, limiting their usefulness in biomedical applications. We propose Multi-Omics integration with Tree-generated Graph Neural Network (MOTGNN), a novel and interpretable framework for binary disease classification. MOTGNN employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for omics-specific supervised graph construction, followed by modality-specific Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical representation learning, and a deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration. Across three real-world disease datasets, MOTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5-10% in accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and remains robust to severe class imbalance. The model maintains computational efficiency through the use of sparse graphs and provides built-in interpretability, revealing both top-ranked biomarkers and the relative contributions of each omics modality. These results highlight the potential of MOTGNN to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability in multi-omics disease modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Unlike pixel grids in images or sequential structures in language, graphs exhibit a typical non-Euclidean structure with complex interactions among the objects. This paper argues that Riemannian geometry provides a principled and necessary foundation for graph representation learning, and that Riemannian graph learning should be viewed as a unifying paradigm rather than a collection of isolated techniques. While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning. This paper aims to provide a coherent viewpoint and to stimulate broader exploration of Riemannian geometry as a foundational framework for future graph learning research.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 11 figures, position paper</p></details> |
| **[VFGS-Net: Frequency-Guided State-Space Learning for Topology-Preserving Retinal Vessel Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10978v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate retinal vessel segmentation is a critical prerequisite for quantitative analysis of retinal images and computer-aided diagnosis of vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. However, the elongated morphology, wide scale variation, and low contrast of retinal vessels pose significant challenges for existing methods, making it difficult to simultaneously preserve fine capillaries and maintain global topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose the Vessel-aware Frequency-domain and Global Spatial modeling Network (VFGS-Net), an end-to-end segmentation framework that seamlessly integrates frequency-aware feature enhancement, dual-path convolutional representation learning, and bidirectional asymmetric spatial state-space modeling within a unified architecture. Specifically, VFGS-Net employs a dual-path feature convolution module to jointly capture fine-grained local textures and multi-scale contextual semantics. A novel vessel-aware frequency-domain channel attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively reweight spectral components, thereby enhancing vessel-relevant responses in high-level features. Furthermore, at the network bottleneck, we propose a bidirectional asymmetric Mamba2-based spatial modeling block to efficiently capture long-range spatial dependencies and strengthen the global continuity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on four publicly available retinal vessel datasets demonstrate that VFGS-Net achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our model consistently improves segmentation accuracy for fine vessels, complex branching patterns, and low-contrast regions, highlighting its robustness and clinical potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stride-Net: Fairness-Aware Disentangled Representation Learning for Chest X-Ray Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10875v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks for chest X-ray classification achieve strong average performance, yet often underperform for specific demographic subgroups, raising critical concerns about clinical safety and equity. Existing debiasing methods frequently yield inconsistent improvements across datasets or attain fairness by degrading overall diagnostic utility, treating fairness as a post hoc constraint rather than a property of the learned representation. In this work, we propose Stride-Net (Sensitive Attribute Resilient Learning via Disentanglement and Learnable Masking with Embedding Alignment), a fairness-aware framework that learns disease-discriminative yet demographically invariant representations for chest X-ray analysis. Stride-Net operates at the patch level, using a learnable stride-based mask to select label-aligned image regions while suppressing sensitive attribute information through adversarial confusion loss. To anchor representations in clinical semantics and discourage shortcut learning, we further enforce semantic alignment between image features and BioBERT-based disease label embeddings via Group Optimal Transport. We evaluate Stride-Net on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks across race and intersectional race-gender subgroups. Across architectures including ResNet and Vision Transformers, Stride-Net consistently improves fairness metrics while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy, achieving a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off than prior debiasing approaches.

| **[Non-Contrastive Vision-Language Learning with Predictive Embedding Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00653v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models have transformed multimodal representation learning, yet dominant contrastive approaches like CLIP require large batch sizes, careful negative sampling, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We introduce NOVA, a NOn-contrastive Vision-language Alignment framework based on joint embedding prediction with distributional regularization. NOVA aligns visual representations to a frozen, domain-specific text encoder by predicting text embeddings from augmented image views, while enforcing an isotropic Gaussian structure via Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization (SIGReg). This eliminates the need for negative sampling, momentum encoders, or stop-gradients, reducing the training objective to a single hyperparameter. We evaluate NOVA on zeroshot chest X-ray classification using ClinicalBERT as the text encoder and Vision Transformers trained from scratch on MIMIC-CXR. On zero-shot classification across three benchmark datasets, NOVA outperforms multiple standard baselines while exhibiting substantially more consistent training runs. Our results demonstrate that non-contrastive vision-language pretraining offers a simpler, more stable, and more effective alternative to contrastive methods.</p></details> |  |

However, there is still a shortage in studies targeting regression tasks, and more specifically applications on hyperspectral data. In this paper, we propose a spectral-spatial contrastive learning framework for regression tasks for hyperspectral data, in a model-agnostic design allowing to enhance backbones such as 3D convolutional and transformer-based networks. Moreover, we provide a collection of transformations relevant for augmenting hyperspectral data. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed framework and transformations significantly improve the performance of all studied backbone models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Image Super-Resolution Quality Assessment based on Content-Free Multi-Model Oriented Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10744v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Super-resolution (SR) applied to real-world low-resolution (LR) images often results in complex, irregular degradations that stem from the inherent complexity of natural scene acquisition. In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets. Experiments on real SR-IQA benchmarks demonstrate that S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches define similarity through historical price patterns or sector classifications, but such backward-looking criteria provide no guarantee about future behavior. We argue that effective asset retrieval should be future-aligned: the retrieved assets should be those most likely to exhibit correlated future returns. To this end, we propose Future-Aligned Soft Contrastive Learning (FASCL), a representation learning framework whose soft contrastive loss uses pairwise future return correlations as continuous supervision targets. We further introduce an evaluation protocol designed to directly assess whether retrieved assets share similar future trajectories. Experiments on 4,229 US equities demonstrate that FASCL consistently outperforms 13 baselines across all future-behavior metrics. The source code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[MePo: Meta Post-Refinement for Rehearsal-Free General Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07940v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To cope with uncertain changes of the external world, intelligent systems must continually learn from complex, evolving environments and respond in real time. This ability, collectively known as general continual learning (GCL), encapsulates practical challenges such as online datastreams and blurry task boundaries. Although leveraging pretrained models (PTMs) has greatly advanced conventional continual learning (CL), these methods remain limited in reconciling the diverse and temporally mixed information along a single pass, resulting in sub-optimal GCL performance. Inspired by meta-plasticity and reconstructive memory in neuroscience, we introduce here an innovative approach named Meta Post-Refinement (MePo) for PTMs-based GCL. This approach constructs pseudo task sequences from pretraining data and develops a bi-level meta-learning paradigm to refine the pretrained backbone, which serves as a prolonged pretraining phase but greatly facilitates rapid adaptation of representation learning to downstream GCL tasks. MePo further initializes a meta covariance matrix as the reference geometry of pretrained representation space, enabling GCL to exploit second-order statistics for robust output alignment. MePo serves as a plug-in strategy that achieves significant performance gains across a variety of GCL benchmarks and pretrained checkpoints in a rehearsal-free manner (e.g., 15.10\%, 13.36\%, and 12.56\% on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200 under Sup-21/1K).

Rethinking Attention Masking for User Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10622v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoder-only large language models are increasingly used as behavioral encoders for user representation learning, yet the impact of attention masking on the quality of user embeddings remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of causal, hybrid, and bidirectional attention masks within a unified contrastive learning framework trained on large-scale real-world Alipay data that integrates long-horizon heterogeneous user behaviors. To improve training dynamics when transitioning from causal to bidirectional attention, we propose Gradient-Guided Soft Masking, a gradient-based pre-warmup applied before a linear scheduler that gradually opens future attention during optimization. Evaluated on 9 industrial user cognition benchmarks covering prediction, preference, and marketing sensitivity tasks, our approach consistently yields more stable training and higher-quality bidirectional representations compared with causal, hybrid, and scheduler-only baselines, while remaining compatible with decoder pretraining. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of masking design and training transition in adapting decoder-only LLMs for effective user representation learning.

Geospatial Representation Learning (GRL), the process of automatically extracting latent structures and semantic patterns from geographic data, is undergoing a profound transformation through two successive technological revolutions: the deep learning breakthrough and the emerging large language model (LLM) paradigm. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in automated feature extraction from structured and semi-structured geospatial data (e.g., satellite imagery, GPS trajectories), the recent integration of LLMs introduces transformative capabilities for cross-modal geospatial reasoning and unstructured geo-textual data processing. This survey presents a comprehensive review of geospatial representation learning across both technological eras, organizing them into a structured taxonomy based on the complete pipeline comprising: (1) data perspective, (2) methodological perspective, and (3) application perspective. We also highlight current advancements, discuss existing limitations, and propose potential future research directions in the LLM and foundation model era. This work offers a thorough exploration of the field and provides a roadmap for further innovation in GRL.

To capture modern representation learning, we treat the state and action spaces as general compact metric spaces and assume Lipschitz policies. To explain the gap between worst-case hardness and empirical success, we introduce problem distributions generated by a reference policy $q$, including a latent-variable model in which proofs exhibit reusable cut/lemma/sketch structure represented by a proof DAG. Under a top-$k$ search protocol and Tsybakov-type margin conditions, we derive lower bounds on finite-horizon success probability that decompose into search and learning terms, with learning controlled by sequential Rademacher/covering complexity. Our main separation result shows that when cut elimination expands a DAG of depth $D$ into a cut-free tree of size $Ω(Λ^D)$ while the cut-aware hierarchical process has size $O(λ^D)$ with $λ\llΛ$, a flat (cut-free) learner provably requires exponentially more data than a cut-aware hierarchical learner. This provides a principled justification for subgoal decomposition in recent agentic theorem provers.</p></details> |  |

In the pretraining stage, we learn comprehensive geospatial representations by integrating Points-of-Interest and temporal mobility patterns to capture regional characteristics from both semantic attribute and temporal mobility pattern views. The forecasting stage leverages these representations through a prompt-empowered framework that fine-tunes Large Language Models while incorporating external events.

In this paper, we propose a representation learning approach that constructs instrumental representations from observed covariates, which enable IV-based estimation even in the absence of an explicit instrument. Our model (ZNet) achieves this through an architecture that mirrors the structural causal model of IVs; it decomposes the ambient feature space into confounding and instrumental components, and is trained by enforcing empirical moment conditions corresponding to the defining properties of valid instruments (i.e., relevance, exclusion restriction, and instrumental unconfoundedness). Importantly, ZNet is compatible with a wide range of downstream two-stage IV estimators of causal effects. Our experiments demonstrate that ZNet can (i) recover ground-truth instruments when they already exist in the ambient feature space and (ii) construct latent instruments in the embedding space when no explicit IVs are available. This suggests that ZNet can be used as a ``plug-and-play'' module for causal inference in general observational settings, regardless of whether the (untestable) assumption of unconfoundedness is satisfied.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches often depend on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation, and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in modeling 3D affordance.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the distinctions between memorization and generalization in diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. By investigating a two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoder (DAE), we prove that (i) memorization corresponds to the model storing raw training samples in the learned weights for encoding and decoding, yielding localized spiky representations, whereas (ii) generalization arises when the model captures local data statistics, producing balanced representations. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical findings on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the same representation structures emerge in deep generative models with significant practical implications. Building on these insights, we propose a representation-based method for detecting memorization and a training-free editing technique that allows precise control via representation steering. Together, our results highlight that learning good representations is central to novel and meaningful generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026. 40 pages, 19 figures.

We believe they hold strong promise for this domain. To unlock this potential, we explicitly align past and future representations, thereby bridging the distributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we introduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that establishes a new representation paradigm, distinct from contrastive learning, by aligning auxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeding them back into any base forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its superior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arise primarily from correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future outputs. Additionally, we provide two theoretical justifications for how reconstruction improves forecasting generalization and how alignment increases the mutual information between learned representations and predicted targets. The code is available at https://github.com/TROUBADOUR000/TimeAlign.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Unsupervised Environment Design through Hierarchical Policy Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09813v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) has emerged as a promising approach to developing general-purpose agents through automated curriculum generation. Popular UED methods focus on Open-Endedness, where teacher algorithms rely on stochastic processes for infinite generation of useful environments. This assumption becomes impractical in resource-constrained scenarios where teacher-student interaction opportunities are limited. To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions. In experiments across several domains, we show that our method outperforms baseline approaches while requiring fewer teacher-student interactions in a single episode. The results suggest the applicability of our approach in settings where training opportunities are limited.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often struggle with flexible view configurations, including arbitrary view combinations, numbers of views, and heterogeneous modalities. Focusing on the context of human activity recognition, we propose RALIS, a model that combines multiview contrastive learning with a mixture-of-experts module to support arbitrary view availability during both training and inference. Instead of trying to reconstruct missing views, an adjusted center contrastive loss is used for self-supervised representation learning and view alignment, mitigating the impact of missing views on multiview fusion. This loss formulation allows for the integration of view weights to account for view quality. Additionally, it reduces computational complexity from $O(V^2)$ to $O(V)$, where $V$ is the number of views. To address residual discrepancies not captured by contrastive learning, we employ a mixture-of-experts module with a specialized load balancing strategy, tasked with adapting to arbitrary view combinations. We highlight the geometric relationship among components in our model and how they combine well in the latent space. RALIS is validated on four datasets encompassing inertial and human pose modalities, with the number of views ranging from three to nine, demonstrating its performance and flexibility.</p></details> |  |

For graphs, an effective tokenizer should yield reusable discrete codes that capture both node semantics and relational structure across scales, yet prior quantization-based graph tokenizers typically combine residual vector quantization (RVQ) levels with fixed rules and often focus on a single structural view, limiting cross-task transfer. We present a hierarchical quantized tokenization framework with task-conditioned routing and dual-view token streams. It produces multi-scale codes and two synchronized sequences: a local stream that preserves node-level information and a diffusion-style multi-hop stream that summarizes connectivity. A lightweight router learns task-dependent mixtures over RVQ depths to select an appropriate granularity, while a gated cross-attention module aligns and fuses the two streams into a single token sequence without altering the downstream backbone encoder. Experiments on node classification and link prediction show consistent gains over strong quantized baselines at matched compute, with ablations verifying contributions from hierarchical quantization, adaptive routing, and fusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[PersonaX: Multimodal Datasets with LLM-Inferred Behavior Traits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11362v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human behavior traits is central to applications in human-computer interaction, computational social science, and personalized AI systems. Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities. PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning.

Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM) centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i) multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and multimodal biosignal integration.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data, particularly as sequence length and data scale increase. This paper proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the proposed approach, a convolutional neural network operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings, after which a Transformer encoder models inter-patch temporal dependencies to generate forecasts. The method is evaluated on a synthetic multivariate time-series dataset with controlled static and dynamic factors, using an extended sequence length and a larger number of samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms a convolutional baseline under increased temporal context and remains competitive with a strong patch-based Transformer model. These findings indicate that structured patch-level tokenization provides a scalable and effective representation for multivariate time-series forecasting, particularly when longer input sequences are considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Traditional industrial solutions often decouple this into two independent tasks: video recommendation (predicting share probability) and receiver recommendation (predicting whom to share with), leading to suboptimal performance due to isolated modeling and inadequate information utilization. To address this, we propose UniShare, a novel unified framework for joint sharing prediction on both video and receiver recommendation. UniShare models the share probability through an enhanced representation learning module that incorporates pre-trained GNN and multi-modal embeddings, alongside explicit bilateral interest and relationship matching. A key innovation is our joint training paradigm, which leverages signals from both tasks to mutually enhance each other, mitigating data sparsity and improving bilateral satisfaction. We also introduce K-Share, a large-scale real-world dataset constructed from Kuaishou platform logs to support research in this domain. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that UniShare significantly outperforms strong baselines on both tasks. Furthermore, online A/B testing on the Kuaishou platform confirms its effectiveness, achieving significant improvements in key metrics including the number of shares (+1.95%) and receiver reply rate (+0.482%).</p></details> |  |
| **[AnyTouch 2: General Optical Tactile Representation Learning For Dynamic Tactile Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09617v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world contact-rich manipulation demands robots to perceive temporal tactile feedback, capture subtle surface deformations, and reason about object properties as well as force dynamics. Although optical tactile sensors are uniquely capable of providing such rich information, existing tactile datasets and models remain limited. These resources primarily focus on object-level attributes (e.g., material) while largely overlooking fine-grained tactile temporal dynamics during physical interactions. We consider that advancing dynamic tactile perception requires a systematic hierarchy of dynamic perception capabilities to guide both data collection and model design. To address the lack of tactile data with rich dynamic information, we present ToucHD, a large-scale hierarchical tactile dataset spanning tactile atomic actions, real-world manipulations, and touch-force paired data. Beyond scale, ToucHD establishes a comprehensive tactile dynamic data ecosystem that explicitly supports hierarchical perception capabilities from the data perspective. Building on it, we propose AnyTouch 2, a general tactile representation learning framework for diverse optical tactile sensors that unifies object-level understanding with fine-grained, force-aware dynamic perception. The framework captures both pixel-level and action-specific deformations across frames, while explicitly modeling physical force dynamics, thereby learning multi-level dynamic perception capabilities from the model perspective. We evaluate our model on benchmarks that covers static object properties and dynamic physical attributes, as well as real-world manipulation tasks spanning multiple tiers of dynamic perception capabilities-from basic object-level understanding to force-aware dexterous manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate consistent and strong performance across sensors and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Previous work showed that integrating content, user preferences, and propagation structure achieves strong performance, but leaves all graph-level representation learning entirely to the GNN, hiding any explicit topological cues. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight enhancement: for each node, we append two classical graph-theoretic metrics, degree centrality and local clustering coefficient, to its original BERT and profile embeddings, thus explicitly flagging the roles of hub and community. In the UPFD Politifact subset, this simple modification boosts macro F1 from 0.7753 to 0.8344 over the original baseline. Our study not only demonstrates the practical value of explicit topology features in fake-news detection but also provides an interpretable, easily reproducible template for fusing graph metrics in other information-diffusion tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Uniformity and Alignment for Multimodal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09507v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal representation learning aims to construct a shared embedding space in which heterogeneous modalities are semantically aligned. Despite strong empirical results, InfoNCE-based objectives introduce inherent conflicts that yield distribution gaps across modalities. In this work, we identify two conflicts in the multimodal regime, both exacerbated as the number of modalities increases: (i) an alignment-uniformity conflict, whereby the repulsion of uniformity undermines pairwise alignment, and (ii) an intra-alignment conflict, where aligning multiple modalities induces competing alignment directions. To address these issues, we propose a principled decoupling of alignment and uniformity for multimodal representations, providing a conflict-free recipe for multimodal learning that simultaneously supports discriminative and generative use cases without task-specific modules. We then provide a theoretical guarantee that our method acts as an efficient proxy for a global Hölder divergence over multiple modality distributions, and thus reduces the distribution gap among modalities. Extensive experiments on retrieval and UnCLIP-style generation demonstrate consistent gains.</p></details> |  |

While this emerging field shows tremendous promise in applications, it faces significant challenges in motion consistency, computational efficiency, and ethical considerations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of diffusion-based video generation, examining its evolution, technical foundations, and practical applications. We present a systematic taxonomy of current methodologies, analyze architectural innovations and optimization strategies, and investigate applications across low-level vision tasks such as denoising and super-resolution. Additionally, we explore the synergies between diffusionbased video generation and related domains, including video representation learning, question answering, and retrieval. Compared to the existing surveys (Lei et al., 2024a;b; Melnik et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2023; Xing et al., 2024c) which focus on specific aspects of video generation, such as human video synthesis (Lei et al., 2024a) or long-form content generation (Lei et al., 2024b), our work provides a broader, more updated, and more fine-grained perspective on diffusion-based approaches with a special section for evaluation metrics, industry solutions, and training engineering techniques in video generation. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of diffusion models and video generation, providing insights into both the theoretical frameworks and practical implementations that drive this rapidly evolving field.

| **[CSRv2: Unlocking Ultra-Sparse Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05735v3)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of large foundation models, the quality of embeddings has become a central determinant of downstream task performance and overall system capability. Yet widely used dense embeddings are often extremely high-dimensional, incurring substantial costs in storage, memory, and inference latency. To address these, Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) is recently proposed as a promising direction, mapping dense embeddings into high-dimensional but k-sparse vectors, in contrast to compact dense embeddings such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). Despite its promise, CSR suffers severe degradation in the ultra-sparse regime, where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much of its efficiency potential unrealized. In this paper, we introduce CSRv2, a principled training approach designed to make ultra-sparse embeddings viable. CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning through progressive k-annealing, enhances representational quality via supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability with full backbone finetuning. CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20% and delivers a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, bringing ultra-sparse embeddings on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions, all with only two active features. While maintaining comparable performance, CSRv2 delivers a 7x speedup over MRL, and yields up to 300x improvements in compute and memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings in text representation. Extensive experiments across text and vision demonstrate that CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, where CSRv2 achieves 7%/4% improvement over CSR when k=4 and further increases this gap to 14%/6% when k=2 in text/vision representation. By making extreme sparsity viable, CSRv2 broadens the design space for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems where both embedding quality and efficiency are critical.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR2026.

| **[Empowering Contrastive Federated Sequential Recommendation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09306v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated sequential recommendation (FedSeqRec) aims to perform next-item prediction while keeping user data decentralised, yet model quality is frequently constrained by fragmented, noisy, and homogeneous interaction logs stored on individual devices. Many existing approaches attempt to compensate through manual data augmentation or additional server-side constraints, but these strategies either introduce limited semantic diversity or increase system overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose \textbf{LUMOS}, a parameter-isolated FedSeqRec architecture that integrates large language models (LLMs) as \emph{local semantic generators}. Instead of sharing gradients or auxiliary parameters, LUMOS privately invokes an on-device LLM to construct three complementary sequence variants from each user history: (i) \emph{future-oriented} trajectories that infer plausible behavioural continuations, (ii) \emph{semantically equivalent rephrasings} that retain user intent while diversifying interaction patterns, and (iii) \emph{preference-inconsistent counterfactuals} that serve as informative negatives. These synthesized sequences are jointly encoded within the federated backbone through a tri-view contrastive optimisation scheme, enabling richer representation learning without exposing sensitive information. Experimental results across three public benchmarks show that LUMOS achieves consistent gains over competitive centralised and federated baselines on HR@20 and NDCG@20. In addition, the use of semantically grounded positive signals and counterfactual negatives improves robustness under noisy and adversarial environments, even without dedicated server-side protection modules. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven semantic generation as a new paradigm for advancing privacy-preserving federated recommendation.</p></details> |  |

Traditional MRI synthesis methods are modality-specific, limited in anatomical adaptability, and lack clinical interpretability-failing to meet NPC's RT needs. Here, we developed a unified foundation model integrating contrastive visual representation learning and vision-language alignment (VLA) to enable any-to-all MRI synthesis. The model uses a contrastive encoder for modality-invariant representations and a CLIP-based text-informed decoder for semantically consistent synthesis, supporting any-to-all MRI synthesis via one unified foundation model. Trained on 40,825 images from 13 institutions, it achieves consistently high performance (average SSIM 0.90, PSNR 27) across 26 internal/external validation sites (15,748 images), with superior synthesis fidelity and robustness to noise and domain shifts. Meanwhile, its unified representation enhances downstream RT-relevant tasks (e.g., segmentation). This work advances digital medicine solutions for NPC care by leveraging foundation models to bridge technical synthesis and clinical utility.</p></details> |  |

Unconstrained reward inference in these settings often leads to high variance and poor generalization. We propose an attention-structured adversarial IRL framework that constrains reward inference via spatiotemporal representation learning. Our method employs multi-head self-attention (MHSA) for long-range temporal dependencies and graph attention networks (GAT) for agent-task relational structures. We formulate reward inference as a low-capacity, adaptive linear transformation of the environment reward, ensuring stable and interpretable guidance. This framework decouples reward inference from policy learning and optimizes the reward model adversarially. Experiments on benchmark MATA scenarios show that our approach outperforms representative MARL baselines in convergence speed, cumulative rewards, and spatial efficiency. Results demonstrate that attention-guided, capacity-constrained reward inference is a scalable and effective mechanism for stabilizing adversarial IRL in complex multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version with substantial new experimental results, improved analysis, and a restructured layout for better clarity</p></details> |

Although optimized with a fully differentiable framework in a planning-oriented manner, existing end-to-end driving systems lacking ego-centric designs still suffer from unsatisfactory performance and inferior efficiency, due to rasterized scene representation learning and redundant information transmission. In this paper, we propose an ego-centric fully sparse paradigm, named EgoFSD, for end-to-end self-driving. Specifically, EgoFSD consists of sparse perception, hierarchical interaction and iterative motion planner. The sparse perception module performs detection and online mapping based on sparse representation of the driving scene. The hierarchical interaction module aims to select the Closest In-Path Vehicle / Stationary (CIPV / CIPS) from coarse to fine, benefiting from an additional geometric prior. As for the iterative motion planner, both selected interactive agents and ego-vehicle are considered for joint motion prediction, where the output multi-modal ego-trajectories are optimized in an iterative fashion. In addition, position-level motion diffusion and trajectory-level planning denoising are introduced for uncertainty modeling, thereby enhancing the training stability and convergence speed. Extensive experiments are conducted on nuScenes and Bench2Drive datasets, which significantly reduces the average L2 error by 59% and collision rate by 92% than UniAD while achieves 6.9x faster running efficiency.</p></details> | Accepted to ICRA2026 |

Empirical evidence indicates that high-dimensional embeddings tend to collapse into narrow cones, concentrating task-relevant semantics in a small subspace, while the majority of dimensions remain occupied by noise and spurious correlations. Such spectral imbalance and entanglement undermine model generalization. We propose Spectral Disentanglement and Enhancement (SDE), a novel framework that bridges the gap between the geometry of the embedded spaces and their spectral properties. Our approach leverages singular value decomposition to adaptively partition feature dimensions into strong signals that capture task-critical semantics, weak signals that reflect ancillary correlations, and noise representing irrelevant perturbations. A curriculum-based spectral enhancement strategy is then applied, selectively amplifying informative components with theoretical guarantees on training stability. Building upon the enhanced features, we further introduce a dual-domain contrastive loss that jointly optimizes alignment in both the feature and spectral spaces, effectively integrating spectral regularization into the training process and encouraging richer, more robust representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SDE consistently improves representation robustness and generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. SDE integrates seamlessly with existing contrastive pipelines, offering an effective solution for multimodal representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grokking in Linear Models for Logistic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08302v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grokking, the phenomenon of delayed generalization, is often attributed to the depth and compositional structure of deep neural networks. We study grokking in one of the simplest possible settings: the learning of a linear model with logistic loss for binary classification on data that are linearly (and max margin) separable about the origin. We investigate three testing regimes: (1) test data drawn from the same distribution as the training data, in which case grokking is not observed; (2) test data concentrated around the margin, in which case grokking is observed; and (3) adversarial test data generated via projected gradient descent (PGD) attacks, in which case grokking is also observed. We theoretically show that the implicit bias of gradient descent induces a three-phase learning process-population-dominated, support-vector-dominated unlearning, and support-vector-dominated generalization-during which delayed generalization can arise. Our analysis further relates the emergence of grokking to asymmetries in the data, both in the number of examples per class and in the distribution of support vectors across classes, and yields a characterization of the grokking time. We experimentally validate our theory by planting different distributions of population points and support vectors, and by analyzing accuracy curves and hyperplane dynamics. Overall, our results demonstrate that grokking does not require depth or representation learning, and can emerge even in linear models through the dynamics of the bias term.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRACE: Learning to Compute on Circuit Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21886v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a circuit graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts, prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of computation. To resolve this, we introduce TRACE, a new paradigm built on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective. First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce function shift learning, a novel objective that decouples the learning problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model is trained to predict only the function shift, the discrepancy between the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input independence. We validate this paradigm on various circuits modalities, including Register Transfer Level graphs, And-Inverter Graphs and post-mapping netlists. Across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the fundamental challenge of learning the functional behavior of a circuit graph.</p></details> |  |

Beyond headline metrics, ViT-5 exhibits improved representation learning and favorable spatial reasoning behavior, and transfers reliably across tasks. With a design aligned with contemporary foundation-model practices, ViT-5 offers a simple drop-in upgrade over vanilla ViT for mid-2020s vision backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/wangf3014/ViT-5</p></details> |

Existing studies consider maintaining similar error across different resolutions as indicative of successful multi-resolution generalization. However, deep learning models serving as alternatives to numerical solvers should reduce error as resolution increases. The fundamental limitation is, the upper bound of physical law frequencies that low-resolution data can represent is constrained by its Nyquist frequency, making it difficult for models to process signals containing unseen frequency components during high-resolution inference. This results in errors being anchored at low resolution, incorrectly interpreted as successful generalization. We define this fundamental phenomenon as a new problem distinct from existing issues: Scale Anchoring. Therefore, we propose architecture-agnostic Frequency Representation Learning. It alleviates Scale Anchoring through resolution-aligned frequency representations and spectral consistency training: on grids with higher Nyquist frequencies, the frequency response in high-frequency bands of FRL-enhanced variants is more stable. This allows errors to decrease with resolution and significantly outperform baselines within our task and resolution range, while incurring only modest computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a poster paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions, text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection.</p></details> |  |
| **[HistoMet: A Pan-Cancer Deep Learning Framework for Prognostic Prediction of Metastatic Progression and Site Tropism from Primary Tumor Histopathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07608v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metastatic Progression remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, yet predicting whether a primary tumor will metastasize and where it will disseminate directly from histopathology remains a fundamental challenge. Although whole-slide images (WSIs) provide rich morphological information, prior computational pathology approaches typically address metastatic status or site prediction as isolated tasks, and do not explicitly model the clinically sequential decision process of metastatic risk assessment followed by downstream site-specific evaluation. To address this research gap, we present a decision-aware, concept-aligned MIL framework, HistoMet, for prognostic metastatic outcome prediction from primary tumor WSIs. Our proposed framework adopts a two-module prediction pipeline in which the likelihood of metastatic progression from the primary tumor is first estimated, followed by conditional prediction of metastatic site for high-risk cases. To guide representation learning and improve clinical interpretability, our framework integrates linguistically defined and data-adaptive metastatic concepts through a pretrained pathology vision-language model. We evaluate HistoMet on a multi-institutional pan-cancer cohort of 6504 patients with metastasis follow-up and site annotations. Under clinically relevant high-sensitivity screening settings (95 percent sensitivity), HistoMet significantly reduces downstream workload while maintaining high metastatic risk recall. Conditional on metastatic cases, HistoMet achieves a macro F1 of 74.6 with a standard deviation of 1.3 and a macro one-vs-rest AUC of 92.1. These results demonstrate that explicitly modeling clinical decision structure enables robust and deployable prognostic prediction of metastatic progression and site tropism directly from primary tumor histopathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Camera Cow Identification via Disentangled Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07566v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise identification of individual cows is a fundamental prerequisite for comprehensive digital management in smart livestock farming. While existing animal identification methods excel in controlled, single-camera settings, they face severe challenges regarding cross-camera generalization. When models trained on source cameras are deployed to new monitoring nodes characterized by divergent illumination, backgrounds, viewpoints, and heterogeneous imaging properties, recognition performance often degrades dramatically. This limits the large-scale application of non-contact technologies in dynamic, real-world farming environments. To address this challenge, this study proposes a cross-camera cow identification framework based on disentangled representation learning. This framework leverages the Subspace Identifiability Guarantee (SIG) theory in the context of bovine visual recognition. By modeling the underlying physical data generation process, we designed a principle-driven feature disentanglement module that decomposes observed images into multiple orthogonal latent subspaces. This mechanism effectively isolates stable, identity-related biometric features that remain invariant across cameras, thereby substantially improving generalization to unseen cameras. We constructed a high-quality dataset spanning five distinct camera nodes, covering heterogeneous acquisition devices and complex variations in lighting and angles. Extensive experiments across seven cross-camera tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 86.0%, significantly outperforming the Source-only Baseline (51.9%) and the strongest cross-camera baseline method (79.8%). This work establishes a subspace-theoretic feature disentanglement framework for collaborative cross-camera cow identification, offering a new paradigm for precise animal monitoring in uncontrolled smart farming environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangled Representation Learning for Parametric Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02136v2)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators (NOs) excel at learning mappings between function spaces, serving as efficient forward solution approximators for PDE-governed systems. However, as black-box solvers, they offer limited insight into the underlying physical mechanism, due to the lack of interpretable representations of the physical parameters that drive the system. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new paradigm for learning disentangled representations from NO parameters, thereby effectively solving an inverse problem. Specifically, we introduce DisentangO, a novel hyper-neural operator architecture designed to unveil and disentangle latent physical factors of variation embedded within the black-box neural operator parameters. At the core of DisentangO is a multi-task NO architecture that distills the varying parameters of the governing PDE through a task-wise adaptive layer, alongside a variational autoencoder that disentangles these variations into identifiable latent factors. By learning these disentangled representations, DisentangO not only enhances physical interpretability but also enables more robust generalization across diverse systems. Empirical evaluations across supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning contexts show that DisentangO effectively extracts meaningful and interpretable latent features, bridging the gap between predictive performance and physical understanding in neural operator frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Molecular Chirality via Chiral Determinant Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07415v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chirality is a fundamental molecular property that governs stereospecific behavior in chemistry and biology. Capturing chirality in machine learning models remains challenging due to the geometric complexity of stereochemical relationships and the limitations of traditional molecular representations that often lack explicit stereochemical encoding. Existing approaches to chiral molecular representation primarily focus on central chirality, relying on handcrafted stereochemical tags or limited 3D encodings, and thus fail to generalize to more complex forms such as axial chirality. In this work, we introduce ChiDeK (Chiral Determinant Kernels), a framework that systematically integrates stereogenic information into molecular representation learning. We propose the chiral determinant kernel to encode the SE(3)-invariant chirality matrix and employ cross-attention to integrate stereochemical information from local chiral centers into the global molecular representation. This design enables explicit modeling of chiral-related features within a unified architecture, capable of jointly encoding central and axial chirality. To support the evaluation of axial chirality, we construct a new benchmark for electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and optical rotation (OR) prediction. Across four tasks, including R/S configuration classification, enantiomer ranking, ECD spectrum prediction, and OR prediction, ChiDeK achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, most notably yielding over 7% higher accuracy on axially chiral tasks on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, clinical sleep studies are resource intensive and are difficult to scale for population level screening. This paper presents a Dual Pipeline Machine Learning Framework for multi class sleep disorder screening using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset. The framework consists of two parallel processing streams: a statistical pipeline that targets linear separability using Mutual Information and Linear Discriminant Analysis, and a wrapper based pipeline that applies Boruta feature selection with an autoencoder for non linear representation learning. To address class imbalance, we use the hybrid SMOTETomek resampling strategy. In experiments, Extra Trees and K Nearest Neighbors achieved an accuracy of 98.67%, outperforming recent baselines on the same dataset. Statistical testing using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test indicates that the improvement over baseline configurations is significant, and inference latency remains below 400 milliseconds. These results suggest that the proposed dual pipeline design supports accurate and efficient automated screening for non invasive sleep disorder risk stratification.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Pooling: Matching for Robust Generalization under Data Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07154v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pooling heterogeneous datasets across domains is a common strategy in representation learning, but naive pooling can amplify distributional asymmetries and yield biased estimators, especially in settings where zero-shot generalization is required. We propose a matching framework that selects samples relative to an adaptive centroid and iteratively refines the representation distribution. The double robustness and the propensity score matching for the inclusion of data domains make matching more robust than naive pooling and uniform subsampling by filtering out the confounding domains (the main cause of heterogeneity). Theoretical and empirical analyses show that, unlike naive pooling or uniform subsampling, matching achieves better results under asymmetric meta-distributions, which are also extended to non-Gaussian and multimodal real-world settings. Most importantly, we show that these improvements translate to zero-shot medical anomaly detection, one of the extreme forms of data heterogeneity and asymmetry.

We introduce entropy-ordered flows (EOFlows), a normalizing-flow framework that orders latent dimensions by their explained entropy, analogously to PCA's explained variance. This ordering enables adaptive injective flows: after training, one may retain only the top C latent variables to form a compact core representation while the remaining variables capture fine-grained detail and noise, with C chosen flexibly at inference time rather than fixed during training. EOFlows build on insights from Independent Mechanism Analysis, Principal Component Flows and Manifold Entropic Metrics. We combine likelihood-based training with local Jacobian regularization and noise augmentation into a method that scales well to high-dimensional data such as images. Experiments on the CelebA dataset show that our method uncovers a rich set of semantically interpretable features, allowing for high compression and strong denoising.</p></details> |  |

However, their capacity to interpret and design antibodies through natural language remains limited. To address this challenge, we present AFD-Instruction, the first large-scale instruction dataset with functional annotations tailored to antibodies. This dataset encompasses two key components: antibody understanding, which infers functional attributes directly from sequences, and antibody design, which enables de novo sequence generation under functional constraints. These components provide explicit sequence-function alignment and support antibody design guided by natural language instructions. Extensive instruction-tuning experiments on general-purpose LLMs demonstrate that AFD-Instruction consistently improves performance across diverse antibody-related tasks. By linking antibody sequences with textual descriptions of function, AFD-Instruction establishes a new foundation for advancing antibody modeling and accelerating therapeutic discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

To this end, 3D object detection serves as the core basis of perception stack especially for the sake of path planning, motion prediction, and collision avoidance etc. Taking a quick glance at the progress we have made, we attribute challenges to visual appearance recovery in the absence of depth information from images, representation learning from partially occluded unstructured point clouds, and semantic alignments over heterogeneous features from cross modalities. Despite existing efforts, 3D object detection for autonomous driving is still in its infancy. Recently, a large body of literature have been investigated to address this 3D vision task. Nevertheless, few investigations have looked into collecting and structuring this growing knowledge. We therefore aim to fill this gap in a comprehensive survey, encompassing all the main concerns including sensors, datasets, performance metrics and the recent state-of-the-art detection methods, together with their pros and cons. Furthermore, we provide quantitative comparisons with the state of the art. A case study on fifteen selected representative methods is presented, involved with runtime analysis, error analysis, and robustness analysis. Finally, we provide concluding remarks after an in-depth analysis of the surveyed works and identify promising directions for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is accepted by Pattern Recognition on 14 May 2022</p></details> |

In this work, we present a proof-of-concept framework that leverages generative representations learned from multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery to identify gold-bearing regions from space. An autoencoder foundation model, called Isometric, which is pretrained on the large-scale FalconSpace-S2 v1.0 dataset, produces information-dense spectral-spatial representations that serve as inputs to a lightweight XGBoost classifier. We compare this representation-based approach with a raw spectral input baseline using a dataset of 63 Sentinel-2 images from known gold and non-gold locations. The proposed method improves patch-level accuracy from 0.51 to 0.68 and image-level accuracy from 0.55 to 0.73, demonstrating that generative embeddings capture transferable mineralogical patterns even with limited labeled data. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model representations to make mineral exploration more efficient, scalable, and globally applicable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in Eurips2025, 1st Workshop: Advances in Representation Learning for Earth Observation</p></details> |
| **[Disentanglement by means of action-induced representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06741v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning interpretable representations with variational autoencoders (VAEs) is a major goal of representation learning. The main challenge lies in obtaining disentangled representations, where each latent dimension corresponds to a distinct generative factor. This difficulty is fundamentally tied to the inability to perform nonlinear independent component analysis. Here, we introduce the framework of action-induced representations (AIRs) which models representations of physical systems given experiments (or actions) that can be performed on them. We show that, in this framework, we can provably disentangle degrees of freedom w.r.t. their action dependence. We further introduce a variational AIR architecture (VAIR) that can extract AIRs and therefore achieve provable disentanglement where standard VAEs fail. Beyond state representation, VAIR also captures the action dependence of the underlying generative factors, directly linking experiments to the degrees of freedom they influence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 10 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

JEPAs learn to predict in representation space rather than pixel space, avoiding the pitfalls of generative modeling while capturing semantically meaningful features suitable for downstream tasks. Our library provides modular, self-contained implementations that illustrate how representation learning techniques developed for image-level self-supervised learning can transfer to video, where temporal dynamics add complexity, and ultimately to action-conditioned world models, where the model must additionally learn to predict the effects of control inputs. Each example is designed for single-GPU training within a few hours, making energy-based self-supervised learning accessible for research and education. We provide ablations of JEA components on CIFAR-10. Probing these representations yields 91% accuracy, indicating that the model learns useful features. Extending to video, we include a multi-step prediction example on Moving MNIST that demonstrates how the same principles scale to temporal modeling. Finally, we show how these representations can drive action-conditioned world models, achieving a 97% planning success rate on the Two Rooms navigation task. Comprehensive ablations reveal the critical importance of each regularization component for preventing representation collapse.

| **[Multi-Order Wavelet Derivative Transform for Deep Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11781v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In deep time series forecasting, the Fourier Transform (FT) is extensively employed for frequency representation learning. However, it often struggles in capturing multi-scale, time-sensitive patterns. Although the Wavelet Transform (WT) can capture these patterns through frequency decomposition, its coefficients are insensitive to change points in time series, leading to suboptimal modeling. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce the multi-order Wavelet Derivative Transform (WDT) grounded in the WT, enabling the extraction of time-aware patterns spanning both the overall trend and subtle fluctuations. Compared with the standard FT and WT, which model the raw series, the WDT operates on the derivative of the series, selectively magnifying rate-of-change cues and exposing abrupt regime shifts that are particularly informative for time series modeling. Practically, we embed the WDT into a multi-branch framework named WaveTS, which decomposes the input series into multi-scale time-frequency coefficients, refines them via linear layers, and reconstructs them into the time domain via the inverse WDT. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that WaveTS achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while retaining high computational efficiency.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, the representation capabilities of existing methods are essentially limited to atom-level information, which is not sufficient to describe real-world molecular physics. Although electron-level information can provide fundamental knowledge about chemical compounds beyond the atom-level information, obtaining the electron-level information in real-world molecules is computationally impractical and sometimes infeasible. We propose a method for learning electron-informed molecular representations without additional computation costs by transferring readily accessible electron-level information about small molecules to large molecules of our interest. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on extensive benchmark datasets containing experimentally observed molecular physics.

Yet, to harness these benefits, it is critical for the learned representations to fully capture both static and dynamic semantics. However, our experiments show that existing V-CL methods fail to effectively learn either type of feature. Through a rigorous theoretical analysis based on the Structural Causal Model and gradient update, we find that in a given dataset, certain static semantics consistently co-occur with specific dynamic semantics. This phenomenon creates spurious correlations between static and dynamic semantics in the dataset. However, existing V-CL methods do not differentiate static and dynamic similarities when computing sample similarity. As a result, learning only one type of semantics is sufficient for the model to minimize the contrastive loss. Ultimately, this causes the V-CL pre-training process to prioritize learning the easier-to-learn semantics. To address this limitation, we propose Bi-level Optimization with Decoupling for Video Contrastive Learning. (BOD-VCL). In BOD-VCL, we model videos as linear dynamical systems based on Koopman theory. In this system, all frame-to-frame transitions are represented by a linear Koopman operator. By performing eigen-decomposition on this operator, we can separate time-variant and time-invariant components of semantics, which allows us to explicitly separate the static and dynamic semantics in the video. By modeling static and dynamic similarity separately, both types of semantics can be fully exploited during the V-CL training process. BOD-VCL can be seamlessly integrated into existing V-CL frameworks, and experimental results highlight the significant improvements achieved by our method.</p></details> |  |

We introduce GIRCSE (Generative Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an emergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference steadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative refinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.</p></details> |  |

However, many contemporary models prioritize task performance while neglecting biologically grounded processing pathways. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired vision model that captures principles of the insect visual system to transform dense visual input into sparse, discriminative codes. The model is trained using a fully self-supervised contrastive objective, enabling representation learning without labeled data and supporting reuse across tasks without reliance on domain-specific classifiers. We evaluated the resulting representations on flower recognition tasks and natural image benchmarks. The model consistently produced reliable sparse codes that distinguish visually similar inputs. To support different modelling and deployment uses, we have implemented the model as both an artificial neural network and a spiking neural network. In a simulated localization setting, our approach outperformed a simple image downsampling comparison baseline, highlighting the functional benefit of incorporating neuromorphic visual processing pathways. Collectively, these results advance insect computational modelling by providing a generalizable bio-inspired vision model capable of sparse computation across diverse tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[ASMa: Asymmetric Spatio-temporal Masking for Skeleton Action Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06251v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown remarkable success in skeleton-based action recognition by leveraging data augmentations to learn meaningful representations. However, existing SSL methods rely on data augmentations that predominantly focus on masking high-motion frames and high-degree joints such as joints with degree 3 or 4. This results in biased and incomplete feature representations that struggle to generalize across varied motion patterns. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Spatio-temporal Masking (ASMa) for Skeleton Action Representation Learning, a novel combination of masking to learn a full spectrum of spatio-temporal dynamics inherent in human actions. ASMa employs two complementary masking strategies: one that selectively masks high-degree joints and low-motion, and another that masks low-degree joints and high-motion frames. These masking strategies ensure a more balanced and comprehensive skeleton representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable feature alignment module to effectively align the representations learned from both masked views. To facilitate deployment in resource-constrained settings and on low-resource devices, we compress the learned and aligned representation into a lightweight model using knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SSL methods with an average improvement of 2.7-4.4% in fine-tuning and up to 5.9% in transfer learning to noisy datasets and achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised baselines. Our distilled model achieves 91.4% parameter reduction and 3x faster inference on edge devices while maintaining competitive accuracy, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, when utilised within skipless architectures, which aim to improve representation learning, recent work has highlighted the inherent instability of SSA due to inducing rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. In this work, we design a novel attention mechanism: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), which aims to bypass these issues with SSA, in order to allow for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connections and normalisation layers to be more easily trained. In particular, OSA parametrises the attention matrix to be orthogonal via mapping a skew-symmetric matrix, formed from query-key values, through the matrix exponential. We show that this can be practically implemented, by exploiting the low-rank structure of our query-key values, resulting in the computational complexity and memory cost of OSA scaling linearly with sequence length. Furthermore, we derive an initialisation scheme for which we prove ensures that the Jacobian of OSA is well-conditioned.</p></details> | Preprint |

We introduce GOQ, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ comprises synthetic and real-world images and corresponding 3D meshes of diverse polyhedra covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry, from Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids to stellations and compound shapes. Through systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to reconstruct even basic geometric Platonic solids accurately. Next, although foundation models may be shown via linear and non-linear probing to capture specific 3D symmetry elements, they falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation, such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claud exhibit remarkably low accuracy in interpreting basic shape properties such as face geometry, convexity, and compound structures of complex polyhedra. GIQ is publicly available at toomanymatts.github.io/giq-benchmark/, providing a structured platform to benchmark critical gaps in geometric intelligence and facilitate future progress in robust, geometry-aware representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026.

However, low-quality data induced by multimodal noise poses a major challenge in this domain, causing existing methods to suffer from two key limitations. First, they struggle to handle heterogeneous data noise, hindering robust multimodal representation learning. Second, they exhibit limited adaptability and generalization when encountering previously unseen noise. To address these issues, we propose Test-time Adaptive Hierarchical Co-enhanced Denoising Network (TAHCD). On one hand, TAHCD introduces the Adaptive Stable Subspace Alignment and Sample-Adaptive Confidence Alignment to reliably remove heterogeneous noise. They account for noise at both global and instance levels and enable jointly removal of modality-specific and cross-modality noise, achieving robust learning. On the other hand, TAHCD introduces Test-Time Cooperative Enhancement, which adaptively updates the model in response to input noise in a label-free manner, thus improving generalization. This is achieved by collaboratively enhancing the joint removal process of modality-specific and cross-modality noise across global and instance levels according to sample noise. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance, robustness, and generalization compared with state-of-the-art reliable multimodal learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages,9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

We present RGCF-XRec, a hybrid framework that introduces reasoning-guided collaborative filtering (CF) knowledge into a language model to deliver explainable sequential recommendations in a single step. Theoretical grounding and empirical findings reveal that RGCF-XRec offers three key merits over leading CF-aware LLM-based methods: (1) reasoning-guided augmentation of CF knowledge through contextual prompting to discover latent preferences and interpretable reasoning paths; (2) an efficient scoring mechanism based on four dimensions: coherence, completeness, relevance, and consistency to mitigate noisy CF reasoning traces and retain high-quality explanations; (3) a unified representation learning network that encodes collaborative and semantic signals, enabling a structured prompt to condition the LLM for explainable sequential recommendation. RGCF-XRec demonstrates consistent improvements across Amazon datasets, Sports, Toys, and Beauty, comprising 642,503 user-item interactions. It improves HR@10 by 7.38\% in Sports and 4.59\% in Toys, along with ROUGE-L by 8.02\% and 3.49\%, respectively. It reduces the cold warm performance gap, achieving overall gains of 14.5\% in cold-start and 11.9\% in warm start scenarios, and enhances zero-shot HR@5 by 18.54\% in Beauty and 23.16\% in Toys, highlighting effective generalization and robustness. Moreover, RGCF-XRec achieves training efficiency with a lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B backbone, ensuring scalability for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phi-Former: A Pairwise Hierarchical Approach for Compound-Protein Interactions Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05479v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery remains time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, often requiring years and substantial investment per drug candidate. Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial.

Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces. Extensive experiments conducted across customized clustering, customized classification, and customized retrieval tasks demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Are RL Hyperparameters Benign? A Study in Offline Goal-Conditioned RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05459v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperparameter sensitivity in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often accepted as unavoidable. However, it remains unclear whether it is intrinsic to the RL problem or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. We investigate this question in offline goal-conditioned RL, where data distributions are fixed, and non-stationarity can be explicitly controlled via scheduled shifts in data quality. Additionally, we study varying data qualities under both stationary and non-stationary regimes, and cover two representative algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Overall, we observe substantially greater robustness to changes in hyperparameter configurations than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity. Once modest expert data is present ($\approx$ 20\%), QRL maintains broad, stable near-optimal regions, while HIQL exhibits sharp optima that drift significantly across training phases. To explain this divergence, we introduce an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic. We find that bootstrapped objectives exhibit stronger destructive gradient interference, which coincides directly with hyperparameter sensitivity. These results suggest that high sensitivity to changes in hyperparameter configurations during training is not inevitable in RL, but is amplified by the dynamics of bootstrapping, offering a pathway toward more robust algorithmic objective design.</p></details> | 27 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Physics-Driven Local-Whole Elastic Deformation Modeling for Point Cloud Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13812v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing point cloud representation learning methods primarily rely on data-driven strategies to extract geometric information from large amounts of scattered data. However, most methods focus solely on the spatial distribution features of point clouds while overlooking the relationship between local information and the whole structure, which limits the accuracy of point cloud representation. Local information reflect the fine-grained variations of an object, while the whole structure is determined by the interaction and combination of these local features, collectively defining the object's shape. In real-world, objects undergo deformation under external forces, and this deformation gradually affects the whole structure through the propagation of forces from local regions, thereby altering the object's geometric features. Therefore, appropriately introducing a physics-driven mechanism to capture the topological relationships between local parts and the whole object can effectively mitigate for the limitations of data-driven point cloud methods in structural modeling, and enhance the generalization and interpretability of point cloud representations for downstream tasks such as understanding and recognition. Inspired by this, we incorporate a physics-driven mechanism into the data-driven method to learn fine-grained features in point clouds and model the structural relationship between local regions and the whole shape. Specifically, we design a dual-task encoder-decoder framework that combines the geometric modeling capability of data-driven implicit fields with physics-driven elastic deformation. Through the integration of physics-based loss functions, the framework is guided to predict localized deformation and explicitly capture the correspondence between local structural changes and whole shape variations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning with Adaptive Prototype Manifolds for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05349v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task for the safe deployment of machine learning models in the real world. Existing prototype-based representation learning methods have demonstrated exceptional performance. Specifically, we identify two fundamental flaws that universally constrain these methods: the Static Homogeneity Assumption (fixed representational resources for all classes) and the Learning-Inference Disconnect (discarding rich prototype quality knowledge at inference). These flaws fundamentally limit the model's capacity and performance. To address these issues, we propose APEX (Adaptive Prototype for eXtensive OOD Detection), a novel OOD detection framework designed via a Two-Stage Repair process to optimize the learned feature manifold. APEX introduces two key innovations to address these respective flaws: (1) an Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM), which leverages the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to automatically determine the optimal prototype complexity $K_c^*$ for each class, thereby fundamentally resolving prototype collision; and (2) a Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS) mechanism, which quantifies prototype quality (cohesion and separation) to bridge the learning-inference disconnect. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-100 validate the superiority of our method, where APEX achieves new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[SurgLaVi: Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset for Surgical Vision-Language Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10555v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language pre-training (VLP) offers unique advantages for surgery by aligning language with surgical videos, enabling workflow understanding and transfer across tasks without relying on expert-labeled datasets. However, progress in surgical VLP remains constrained by the limited scale, procedural diversity, semantic quality, and hierarchical structure of existing datasets. In this work, we present SurgLaVi, the largest and most diverse surgical vision-language dataset to date, comprising nearly 240k clip-caption pairs from more than 200 procedures, and featuring hierarchical levels at coarse-, mid-, and fine-level. At the core of SurgLaVi lies a fully automated pipeline that systematically generates fine-grained transcriptions of surgical videos and segments them into coherent procedural units. To ensure high-quality annotations, it applies dual-modality filtering to remove irrelevant and noisy samples. Within this framework, the resulting captions are enriched with contextual detail, producing annotations that are both semantically rich and easy to interpret. To ensure accessibility, we release SurgLaVi-$\b{eta}$, an open-source derivative of 113k clip-caption pairs constructed entirely from public data, which is over four times larger than existing surgical VLP datasets. To demonstrate the value of the SurgLaVi datasets, we introduce SurgCLIP, a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders, as a representative base model. SurgCLIP achieves consistent improvements across phase, step, action, and tool recognition, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods, often by large margins. These results validate that large-scale, semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as a key resource for developing surgical foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangled Representation Learning via Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05214v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disentangled representation learning aims to capture the underlying explanatory factors of observed data, enabling a principled understanding of the data-generating process. Recent advances in generative modeling have introduced new paradigms for learning such representations. However, existing diffusion-based methods encourage factor independence via inductive biases, yet frequently lack strong semantic alignment. In this work, we propose a flow matching-based framework for disentangled representation learning, which casts disentanglement as learning factor-conditioned flows in a compact latent space. To enforce explicit semantic alignment, we introduce a non-overlap (orthogonality) regularizer that suppresses cross-factor interference and reduces information leakage between factors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over representative baselines, yielding higher disentanglement scores as well as improved controllability and sample fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[GMAC: Global Multi-View Constraint for Automatic Multi-Camera Extrinsic Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01033v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic calibration of multi-camera systems, namely the accurate estimation of spatial extrinsic parameters, is fundamental for 3D reconstruction, panoramic perception, and multi-view data fusion. Existing methods typically rely on calibration targets, explicit geometric modeling, or task-specific neural networks. Such approaches often exhibit limited robustness and applicability in complex dynamic environments or online scenarios, making them difficult to deploy in practical applications. To address this, this paper proposes GMAC, a multi-camera extrinsic estimation framework based on the implicit geometric representations learned by multi-view reconstruction networks. GMAC models extrinsics as global variables constrained by the latent multi-view geometric structure and prunes and structurally reconfigures existing networks so that their latent features can directly support extrinsic prediction through a lightweight regression head, without requiring a completely new network design. Furthermore, GMAC jointly optimizes cross-view reprojection consistency and multi-view cycle consistency, ensuring geometric coherence across cameras while improving prediction accuracy and optimization stability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-camera datasets demonstrate that GMAC achieves accurate and stable extrinsic estimation without explicit 3D reconstruction or manual calibration, providing a new solution for efficient deployment and online calibration of multi-camera systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>A 5-p...</summary><p>A 5-page paper with 1 figure, prepared for submission to the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)</p></details> |

To surmount these challenges, we propose SHaSaM (Submodular Hard Sample Mining), a novel combinatorial approach that models fairness-driven representation learning as a submodular hard-sample mining problem. Our two-stage approach comprises of SHaSaM-MINE, which introduces a submodular subset selection strategy to mine hard positives and negatives - effectively mitigating data imbalance, and SHaSaM-LEARN, which introduces a family of combinatorial loss functions based on Submodular Conditional Mutual Information to maximize the decision boundary between target classes while minimizing the influence of sensitive attributes. This unified formulation restricts the model from learning features tied to sensitive attributes, significantly enhancing fairness without sacrificing performance. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace demonstrate that SHaSaM achieves state-of-the-art results, with up to 2.7 points improvement in model fairness (Equalized Odds) and a 3.5% gain in Accuracy, within fewer epochs as compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 tables, 10 figures</p></details> |

To this end, we explore the gradient descent learning of a general Gaussian Multi-index model $f(\boldsymbol{x})=g(\boldsymbol{U}\boldsymbol{x})$ with hidden subspace $\boldsymbol{U}\in \mathbb{R}^{r\times d}$, which is the canonical setup to study representation learning. We prove that under generic non-degenerate assumptions on the link function, a standard two-layer neural network trained via layer-wise gradient descent can agnostically learn the target with $o_d(1)$ test error using $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d)$ samples and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^2)$ time. The sample and time complexity both align with the information-theoretic limit up to leading order and are therefore optimal. During the first stage of gradient descent learning, the proof proceeds via showing that the inner weights can perform a power-iteration process. This process implicitly mimics a spectral start for the whole span of the hidden subspace and eventually eliminates finite-sample noise and recovers this span. It surprisingly indicates that optimal results can only be achieved if the first layer is trained for more than $\mathcal{O}(1)$ steps. This work demonstrates the ability of neural networks to effectively learn hierarchical functions with respect to both sample and time efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>85 pa...</summary><p>85 pages, 2 figures.

Unlike prior graph-based MOT methods that redesign tracking architectures, UniTrack provides a universal training objective that integrates detection accuracy, identity preservation, and spatiotemporal consistency into a single end-to-end trainable loss function, enabling seamless integration with existing MOT systems without architectural modifications. Through differentiable graph representation learning, UniTrack enables networks to learn holistic representations of motion continuity and identity relationships across frames. We validate UniTrack across diverse tracking models and multiple challenging benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements across all tested architectures and datasets including Trackformer, MOTR, FairMOT, ByteTrack, GTR, and MOTE. Extensive evaluations show up to 53\% reduction in identity switches and 12\% IDF1 improvements across challenging benchmarks, with GTR achieving peak performance gains of 9.7\% MOTA on SportsMOT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Representation Meets Stochastic Modeling under Generic Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05033v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning meaningful causal representations from observations has emerged as a crucial task for facilitating machine learning applications and driving scientific discoveries in fields such as climate science, biology, and physics. This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics. Across simulated and empirical studies, we find that MUTATE can effectively answer scientific questions, such as the accumulation of mutations in genomics and the mechanisms driving neuron spike triggers in response to time-varying dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source codes and data will be available upon the publication of this work</p></details> |

Continual learning (CL) addresses this by adapting models over time without catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful representation-learning paradigm that improves robustness and sample efficiency in a self-supervised manner. This paper reviews the usage of \emph{contrastive continual learning} (CCL) for IoT, connecting algorithmic design (replay, regularization, distillation, prompts) with IoT system realities (TinyML constraints, intermittent connectivity, privacy). We present a unifying problem formulation, derive common objectives that blend contrastive and distillation losses, propose an IoT-oriented reference architecture for on-device, edge, and cloud-based CCL, and provide guidance on evaluation protocols and metrics. Finally, we highlight open unique challenges with respect to the IoT domain, such as spanning tabular and streaming IoT data, concept drift, federated settings, and energy-aware training.</p></details> |  |

Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper, we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture. UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity. The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric design.

Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context, recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and edge features for improved expressivity. However, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably, SpectRe is strictly more expressive than PH and spectral information on graphs alone. We also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant learning tasks.

Nevertheless, they focus on direct prediction by encapsulating both representation learning and task-specific inference inside a single, resource-intensive network. This work specifically focuses on representation learning, i.e., on transferable, task-agnostic embeddings. We systematically evaluate task-agnostic representations extracted from tabular foundation models (TabPFN, TabICL and TabSTAR) alongside classical feature engineering (TableVectorizer and a sphere model) across a variety of application tasks as outlier detection (ADBench) and supervised learning (TabArena Lite). We find that simple feature engineering methods achieve comparable or superior performance while requiring significantly less computational resources than tabular foundation models.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we reformulate continual learning as a control problem where learning and preservation signals compete within neural activity dynamics. We convert regularization penalties into preservation signals that protect prior-task representations. Learning then proceeds by minimizing the control effort required to integrate new tasks while competing with the preservation of prior tasks. At equilibrium, the neural activities produce weight updates that implicitly encode the full prior-task curvature, a property we term the continual-natural gradient, requiring no explicit curvature storage. Experiments confirm that our learning framework recovers true prior-task curvature and enables task discrimination, outperforming existing methods on standard benchmarks without replay.</p></details> |  |

However, prior hyperbolic GCD methods only use hyperbolic geometry for representation learning and transform back to Euclidean geometry when clustering. We hypothesize this is suboptimal. Therefore, we present Hyperbolic Clustered GCD (HC-GCD), which learns embeddings in the Lorentz Hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry, and clusters these embeddings directly in hyperbolic space using a hyperbolic K-Means algorithm. We test our model on the Semantic Shift Benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that HC-GCD is on par with the previous state-of-the-art hyperbolic GCD method. Furthermore, we show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to better accuracy than Euclidean K-Means. We carry out ablation studies showing that clipping the norm of the Euclidean embeddings leads to decreased accuracy in clustering unseen classes, and increased accuracy for seen classes, while the overall accuracy is dataset dependent. We also show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to more consistent clusters when varying the label granularity.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Order Matters in Retrosynthesis: Structure-aware Generation via Reaction-Center-Guided Discrete Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13136v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Template-free retrosynthesis methods treat the task as black-box sequence generation, limiting learning efficiency, while semi-template approaches rely on rigid reaction libraries that constrain generalization. We address this gap with a key insight: atom ordering in neural representations matters. Building on this insight, we propose a structure-aware template-free framework that encodes the two-stage nature of chemical reactions as a positional inductive bias. By placing reaction center atoms at the sequence head, our method transforms implicit chemical knowledge into explicit positional patterns that the model can readily capture. The proposed RetroDiT backbone, a graph transformer with rotary position embeddings, exploits this ordering to prioritize chemically critical regions. Combined with discrete flow matching, our approach decouples training from sampling and enables generation in 20--50 steps versus 500 for prior diffusion methods. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both USPTO-50k (61.2% top-1) and the large-scale USPTO-Full (51.3% top-1) with predicted reaction centers. With oracle centers, performance reaches 71.1% and 63.4% respectively, surpassing foundation models trained on 10 billion reactions while using orders of magnitude less data. Ablation studies further reveal that structural priors outperform brute-force scaling: a 280K-parameter model with proper ordering matches a 65M-parameter model without it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amortized Molecular Optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12162v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular design encompasses tasks ranging from de-novo design to structural alteration of given molecules or fragments. For the latter, state-of-the-art methods predominantly function as "Instance Optimizers'', expending significant compute restarting the search for every input structure. While model-based approaches theoretically offer amortized efficiency by learning a policy transferable to unseen structures, existing methods struggle to generalize. We identify a key failure mode: the high variance arising from the heterogeneous difficulty of distinct starting structures. To address this, we introduce GRXForm, adapting a pre-trained Graph Transformer model that optimizes molecules via sequential atom-and-bond additions. We employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for goal-directed fine-tuning to mitigate variance by normalizing rewards relative to the starting structure. Empirically, GRXForm generalizes to out-of-distribution molecular scaffolds without inference-time oracle calls or refinement, achieving scores in multi-objective optimization competitive with leading instance optimizers.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

This article presents CardinalGraphFormer, a graph transformer that augments structured attention with a query-conditioned gated unnormalized aggregation channel to preserve dynamic cardinality signals, complemented by graph-specific structural biases; a locality prior via sparse masking provides scalability for larger graphs. For typical drug-like molecules (K = 3 is near-global), masking acts mainly as a regularizer; for larger graphs it provides meaningful efficiency gains. Pretraining unifies contrastive alignment of augmented graph views and masked reconstruction of attributes. Evaluations on public benchmarks show consistent gains over baselines, isolated via controls for capacity, objectives, and size effects. Ablations confirm the cardinality channel's contributions beyond simpler approximations, with efficiency benefits on large molecules. Code, artifacts, and protocols emphasize reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight and parameter-efficient foundation model with plug-and-play integration of fMRI time series and diffusion-derived structural connectivity, allowing unimodal or multimodal training and deployment without architectural changes while requiring substantially less data compared to the state-of-the-art. The model processes fMRI time series through parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams, distilled into compact embeddings by a Perceiver module, while a novel signed graph transformer encodes anatomical connectivity from diffusion MRI. These complementary representations are then combined through an adaptive fusion mechanism. Despite its compact design, BrainSymphony consistently outperforms larger models on benchmarks spanning prediction, classification, and unsupervised network discovery. Highlighting the model's generalizability and interpretability, attention maps reveal drug-induced context-dependent reorganization of cortical hierarchies in an independent psilocybin neuroimaging dataset. BrainSymphony delivers accessible, interpretable, and clinically meaningful results and demonstrates that architecturally informed, multimodal models can surpass much larger counterparts and advance applications of AI in neuroscience.</p></details> | 32 pages, 14 figures |

Even state-of-the-art models fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics, as their pixel-driven paradigm discards the explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning. To overcome this, we propose a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable. On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains. To facilitate further research, we release our benchmark and implementation at https://github.com/gm-embodied/V2G-Audit.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Boundary-Aware Multi-Behavior Dynamic Graph Transformer for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10493v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the landscape of contemporary recommender systems, user-item interactions are inherently dynamic and sequential, often characterized by various behaviors. Prior research has explored the modeling of user preferences through sequential interactions and the user-item interaction graph, utilizing advanced techniques such as graph neural networks and transformer-based architectures. However, these methods typically fall short in simultaneously accounting for the dynamic nature of graph topologies and the sequential pattern of interactions in user preference models. Moreover, they often fail to adequately capture the multiple user behavior boundaries during model optimization. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a boundary-aware Multi-Behavioral Dynamic Graph Transformer (MB-DGT) model that dynamically refines the graph structure to reflect the evolving patterns of user behaviors and interactions. Our model involves a transformer-based dynamic graph aggregator for user preference modeling, which assimilates the changing graph structure and the sequence of user behaviors. This integration yields a more comprehensive and dynamic representation of user preferences. For model optimization, we implement a user-specific multi-behavior loss function that delineates the interest boundaries among different behaviors, thereby enriching the personalized learning of user preferences. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets indicate that our model consistently delivers remarkable recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DegDiT: Controllable Audio Generation with Dynamic Event Graph Guided Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13786v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable text-to-audio generation aims to synthesize audio from textual descriptions while satisfying user-specified constraints, including event types, temporal sequences, and onset and offset timestamps. This enables precise control over both the content and temporal structure of the generated audio. Despite recent progress, existing methods still face inherent trade-offs among accurate temporal localization, open-vocabulary scalability, and practical efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose DegDiT, a novel dynamic event graph-guided diffusion transformer framework for open-vocabulary controllable audio generation. DegDiT encodes the events in the description as structured dynamic graphs. The nodes in each graph are designed to represent three aspects: semantic features, temporal attributes, and inter-event connections. A graph transformer is employed to integrate these nodes and produce contextualized event embeddings that serve as guidance for the diffusion model. To ensure high-quality and diverse training data, we introduce a quality-balanced data selection pipeline that combines hierarchical event annotation with multi-criteria quality scoring, resulting in a curated dataset with semantic diversity. Furthermore, we present consensus preference optimization, facilitating audio generation through consensus among multiple reward signals. Extensive experiments on AudioCondition, DESED, and AudioTime datasets demonstrate that DegDiT achieves state-of-the-art performances across a variety of objective and subjective evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Graph Transformer with Serialized Graph Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09065v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have demonstrated success in graph learning, particularly for node-level tasks. However, existing methods encounter an information bottleneck when generating graph-level representations. The prevalent single token paradigm fails to fully leverage the inherent strength of self-attention in encoding token sequences, and degenerates into a weighted sum of node signals. To address this issue, we design a novel serialized token paradigm to encapsulate global signals more effectively. Specifically, a graph serialization method is proposed to aggregate node signals into serialized graph tokens, with positional encoding being automatically involved. Then, stacked self-attention layers are applied to encode this token sequence and capture its internal dependencies. Our method can yield more expressive graph representations by modeling complex interactions among multiple graph tokens. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several graph-level benchmarks. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed modules.</p></details> | ICASSP 2026 |
| **[Bipartite Graph Attention-based Clustering for Large-scale scRNA-seq Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07475v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>scRNA-seq clustering is a critical task for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, as it groups cells with similar gene expression profiles. Transformers, as powerful foundational models, have been applied to scRNA-seq clustering. Their self-attention mechanism automatically assigns higher attention weights to cells within the same cluster, enhancing the distinction between clusters. Existing methods for scRNA-seq clustering, such as graph transformer-based models, treat each cell as a token in a sequence. Their computational and space complexities are $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with respect to the number of cells, limiting their applicability to large-scale scRNA-seq datasets.To address this challenge, we propose a Bipartite Graph Transformer-based clustering model (BGFormer) for scRNA-seq data. We introduce a set of learnable anchor tokens as shared reference points to represent the entire dataset. A bipartite graph attention mechanism is introduced to learn the similarity between cells and anchor tokens, bringing cells of the same class closer together in the embedding space. BGFormer achieves linear computational complexity with respect to the number of cells, making it scalable to large datasets. Experimental results on multiple large-scale scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of BGFormer.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[Relational Graph Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10960v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is a promising approach for building state-of-the-art predictive models on multi-table relational data by representing it as a heterogeneous temporal graph. However, commonly used Graph Neural Network models suffer from fundamental limitations in capturing complex structural patterns and long-range dependencies that are inherent in relational data. While Graph Transformers have emerged as powerful alternatives to GNNs on general graphs, applying them to relational entity graphs presents unique challenges: (i) Traditional positional encodings fail to generalize to massive, heterogeneous graphs; (ii) existing architectures cannot model the temporal dynamics and schema constraints of relational data; (iii) existing tokenization schemes lose critical structural information. Here we introduce the Relational Graph Transformer (RelGT), the first graph transformer architecture designed specifically for relational tables. RelGT employs a novel multi-element tokenization strategy that decomposes each node into five components (features, type, hop distance, time, and local structure), enabling efficient encoding of heterogeneity, temporality, and topology without expensive precomputation. Our architecture combines local attention over sampled subgraphs with global attention to learnable centroids, incorporating both local and database-wide representations. Across 21 tasks from the RelBench benchmark, RelGT consistently matches or outperforms GNN baselines by up to 18%, establishing Graph Transformers as a powerful architecture for Relational Deep Learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026, Code: https://github.com/snap-stanford/relgt</p></details> |

The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer, featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping linear complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS), with the DOI: {10.1007/s11704-026-51718-4}</p></details> |

In this work, we show that neither is essential. We introduce HopFormer, a graph Transformer that injects structure exclusively through head-specific n-hop masked sparse attention, without the use of positional encodings or architectural modifications. This design provides explicit and interpretable control over receptive fields while enabling genuinely sparse attention whose computational cost scales linearly with mask sparsity. Through extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse graph structures. Our results further reveal that dense global attention is often unnecessary: on graphs with strong small-world properties, localized attention yields more stable and consistently high performance, while on graphs with weaker small-world effects, global attention offers diminishing returns. Together, these findings challenge prevailing assumptions in graph Transformer design and highlight sparsity-controlled attention as a principled and efficient alternative.</p></details> |  |

| **[Plain Transformers are Surprisingly Powerful Link Predictors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01553v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction is a core challenge in graph machine learning, demanding models that capture rich and complex topological dependencies. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the standard solution, state-of-the-art pipelines often rely on explicit structural heuristics or memory-intensive node embeddings -- approaches that struggle to generalize or scale to massive graphs. Emerging Graph Transformers (GTs) offer a potential alternative but often incur significant overhead due to complex structural encodings, hindering their applications to large-scale link prediction. We challenge these sophisticated paradigms with PENCIL, an encoder-only plain Transformer that replaces hand-crafted priors with attention over sampled local subgraphs, retaining the scalability and hardware efficiency of standard Transformers. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, we show that PENCIL extracts richer structural signals than GNNs, implicitly generalizing a broad class of heuristics and subgraph-based expressivity. Empirically, PENCIL outperforms heuristic-informed GNNs and is far more parameter-efficient than ID-embedding--based alternatives, while remaining competitive across diverse benchmarks -- even without node features. Our results challenge the prevailing reliance on complex engineering techniques, demonstrating that simple design choices are potentially sufficient to achieve the same capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniGAP: A Universal and Adaptive Graph Upsampling Approach to Mitigate Over-Smoothing in Node Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19420v2)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the graph domain, deep graph networks based on Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers often cause over-smoothing of node features, limiting their expressive capacity. Many upsampling techniques involving node and edge manipulation have been proposed to mitigate this issue. However, these methods are often heuristic, resulting in extensive manual labor and suboptimal performance and lacking a universal integration strategy. In this study, we introduce UniGAP, a universal and adaptive graph upsampling framework to mitigate over-smoothing in node classification tasks. Specifically, we design an adaptive graph upsampler based on condensed trajectory features, serving as a plug-in component for existing GNNs to mitigate the over-smoothing problem and enhance performance. Moreover, UniGAP serves as a representation-based and fully differentiable framework to inspire further exploration of graph upsampling methods. Through extensive experiments, UniGAP demonstrates significant improvements over heuristic data augmentation methods in various datasets and metrics. We analyze how graph structure evolves with UniGAP, identifying key bottlenecks where over-smoothing occurs, and providing insights into how UniGAP addresses this issue. Lastly, we show the potential of combining UniGAP with large language models (LLMs) to further improve downstream performance.

In this work, we propose LGM-CL, a local-global multimodal contrastive learning framework that jointly models molecular graphs and textual representations derived from SMILES and chemistry-aware augmented texts. Local functional group information and global molecular topology are captured using AttentiveFP and Graph Transformer encoders, respectively, and aligned through self-supervised contrastive learning. In addition, chemically enriched textual descriptions are contrasted with original SMILES to incorporate physicochemical semantics in a task-agnostic manner. During fine-tuning, molecular fingerprints are further integrated via Dual Cross-attention multimodal fusion. Extensive experiments on MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that LGM-CL achieves consistent and competitive performance across both classification and regression tasks, validating the effectiveness of unified local-global and multimodal representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Heterogeneous Graph Alignment for Joint Reasoning and Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22593v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-graph learning is crucial for extracting meaningful signals from collections of heterogeneous graphs. However, effectively integrating information across graphs with differing topologies, scales, and semantics, often in the absence of shared node identities, remains a significant challenge. We present the Multi-Graph Meta-Transformer (MGMT), a unified, scalable, and interpretable framework for cross-graph learning. MGMT first applies Graph Transformer encoders to each graph, mapping structure and attributes into a shared latent space. It then selects task-relevant supernodes via attention and builds a meta-graph that connects functionally aligned supernodes across graphs using similarity in the latent space. Additional Graph Transformer layers on this meta-graph enable joint reasoning over intra- and inter-graph structure. The meta-graph provides built-in interpretability: supernodes and superedges highlight influential substructures and cross-graph alignments. Evaluating MGMT on both synthetic datasets and real-world neuroscience applications, we show that MGMT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in graph-level prediction tasks while offering interpretable representations that facilitate scientific discoveries. Our work establishes MGMT as a unified framework for structured multi-graph learning, advancing representation techniques in domains where graph-based data plays a central role.</p></details> |  |

Recent graph-based models leverage spatial relationships between Wire-less Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Access Points (APs) and devices, offering finer localization granularity, but fall short in quantifying prediction uncertainty, a key requirement for real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Graph Transformer (SAC-GT), a framework for accurate and reliable indoor localization. SAC-GT integrates a Graph Transformer (GT) model that captures network's spatial topology and signal strength dynamics, with a novel Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Prediction (SACP) method that provides region-specific uncertainty estimates. This allows SAC-GT to produce not only precise two-dimensional (2D) location predictions but also statistically valid confidence regions tailored to varying environmental conditions. Extensive evaluations on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed SAC-GT solution achieves state-of-the-art localization accuracy while delivering robust and spatially adaptive reliability guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICC 2026</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Topology Awareness: Breaking the Granularity Rigidity in Vision-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21751v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) presents a core challenge: grounding high-level linguistic instructions into precise, safe, and long-horizon spatial actions. Explicit topological maps have proven to be a vital solution for providing robust spatial memory in such tasks. However, existing topological planning methods suffer from a "Granularity Rigidity" problem. Specifically, these methods typically rely on fixed geometric thresholds to sample nodes, which fails to adapt to varying environmental complexities. This rigidity leads to a critical mismatch: the model tends to over-sample in simple areas, causing computational redundancy, while under-sampling in high-uncertainty regions, increasing collision risks and compromising precision. To address this, we propose DGNav, a framework for Dynamic Topological Navigation, introducing a context-aware mechanism to modulate map density and connectivity on-the-fly. Our approach comprises two core innovations: (1) A Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy that dynamically modulates graph construction thresholds based on the dispersion of predicted waypoints, enabling "densification on demand" in challenging environments; (2) A Dynamic Graph Transformer that reconstructs graph connectivity by fusing visual, linguistic, and geometric cues into dynamic edge weights, enabling the agent to filter out topological noise and enhancing instruction adherence. Extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate DGNav exhibits superior navigation performance and strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that our framework achieves an optimal trade-off between navigation efficiency and safe exploration.

This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plain Transformers Can be Powerful Graph Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12588v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities, owing to their simple but powerful scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph Transformers (GTs) have strayed far from plain Transformers, exhibiting major architectural differences either by integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention mechanisms. These divergences hinder the easy adoption of training advances for Transformers developed in other domains. Contrary to previous GTs, this work demonstrates that the plain Transformer architecture can be a powerful graph learner. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate three simple, minimal, and easy-to-implement modifications to the plain Transformer architecture to construct our Powerful Plain Graph Transformers (PPGT): (1) simplified $L_2$ attention for measuring the magnitude closeness among tokens; (2) adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude information; and (3) a simple MLP-based stem for graph positional encoding. Consistent with its theoretical expressivity, PPGT demonstrates noteworthy realized expressivity on the empirical graph expressivity benchmark, comparing favorably to more complicated alternatives such as subgraph GNNs and higher-order GNNs. Its empirical performance across various graph datasets also justifies the effectiveness of PPGT. This finding underscores the versatility of plain Transformer architectures and highlights their strong potential as a unified backbone for multimodal learning across language, vision, and graph domains.</p></details> |  |

However, large-scale networks present unique challenges: they contain hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges with heterogeneous and overlapping community structures that evolve over time. Existing approaches face notable limitations: traditional graph neural networks struggle to capture global structural dependencies, while recent graph transformers achieve strong performance but incur quadratic complexity and lack interpretable latent structure. We propose \textbf{TGSBM} (Transformer-Guided Stochastic Block Model), a framework that integrates the principled generative structure of Overlapping Stochastic Block Models with the representational power of sparse Graph Transformers. TGSBM comprises three main components: (i) \emph{expander-augmented sparse attention} that enables near-linear complexity and efficient global mixing, (ii) a \emph{neural variational encoder} that infers structured posteriors over community memberships and strengths, and (iii) a \emph{neural edge decoder} that reconstructs links via OSBM's generative process, preserving interpretability. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance (mean rank 1.6 under HeaRT protocol), superior scalability (up to $6\times$ faster training), and interpretable community structures. These results position TGSBM as a practical approach that strikes a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and transparency for large-scale link prediction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

However, existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map. Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2026.

In general, achieving the time complexity of graph algorithms implemented in conventional languages using a rule-based graph-transformation language is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be implemented in the graph programming language GP 2 such that their runtime matches the time complexity of imperative implementations. However, this required input graphs to have a bounded node degree and (for some algorithms) to be connected. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies: the first program checks whether input graphs are connected, the second program checks whether input graphs are acyclic, and the third program solves the single-source shortest-paths problem for graphs with integer edge-weights. The first two programs run in linear time on (possibly disconnected) input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. The third program runs in time $O(nm)$ on arbitrary input graphs, matching the time complexity of imperative implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. For each program, we formally prove its correctness and time complexity, and provide runtime experiments on various graph classes.</p></details> | LMCS |

We challenge this view by introducing Fixed Aggregation Features (FAFs), a training-free approach that transforms graph learning tasks into tabular problems. This simple shift enables the use of well-established tabular methods, offering strong interpretability and the flexibility to deploy diverse classifiers. Across 14 benchmarks, well-tuned multilayer perceptrons trained on FAFs rival or outperform state-of-the-art GNNs and graph transformers on 12 tasks -- often using only mean aggregation. The only exceptions are the Roman Empire and Minesweeper datasets, which typically require unusually deep GNNs. To explain the theoretical possibility of non-trainable aggregations, we connect our findings to Kolmogorov-Arnold representations and discuss when mean aggregation can be sufficient. In conclusion, our results call for (i) richer benchmarks benefiting from learning diverse neighborhood aggregations, (ii) strong tabular baselines as standard, and (iii) employing and advancing tabular models for graph data to gain new insights into related tasks.</p></details> |  |

Following this trend, we propose a novel approach that empowers off-the-shelf LMs to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNNs on node classification tasks, without requiring any architectural modification. By preserving the LM's original architecture, our approach retains a key benefit of LM instruction tuning: the ability to jointly train on diverse datasets, fostering greater flexibility and efficiency. To achieve this, we introduce two key augmentation strategies: (1) Enriching LMs' input using topological and semantic retrieval methods, which provide richer contextual information, and (2) guiding the LMs' classification process through a lightweight GNN classifier that effectively prunes class candidates. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that backbone Flan-T5 LMs equipped with these augmentation strategies outperform SOTA text-output node classifiers and are comparable to top-performing vector-output node classifiers. By bridging the gap between specialized node classifiers and general LMs, this work paves the way for more versatile and widely applicable graph learning models. We will open-source the code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods fail to consider all types of spatial and temporal interactions among agents and obstacles, leading to unsafe and inefficient robot paths. In this article, we leverage a graph-based representation of crowded and constrained scenarios and propose a structured framework to learn robot navigation policies with deep reinforcement learning. We first split the representations of different inputs and propose a heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph to model distinct interactions among humans, robots, and obstacles. Based on the heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph, we propose HEIGHT, a novel navigation policy network architecture with different components to capture heterogeneous interactions through space and time. HEIGHT utilizes attention mechanisms to prioritize important interactions and a recurrent network to track changes in the dynamic scene over time, encouraging the robot to avoid collisions adaptively. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that HEIGHT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of success, navigation time, and generalization to domain shifts in challenging navigation scenarios.

While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages with 3 figures and 2 tables, submitted to IEEE for a possible publication</p></details> |

However, this can cause overreliance on surface-level labels and impede cross-type knowledge transfer. We explore integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into HGNNs--a direction underexplored despite MoE's success in homogeneous settings. Crucially, we question the need for type-specific experts. We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics. Our work demonstrates that regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations--a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has been withdrawn by the authors due to significant revisions in preparation for conference submission.

Text2Structure3D is designed to support new intuitive ways of design exploration and iteration in the conceptual structural design process. The approach combines latent diffusion with a Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) and graph transformers to generate structural graphs that are close to an equilibrium state. Text2Structure3D integrates a residual force optimization post-processing step that ensures generated structures fully satisfy static equilibrium. The model was trained and validated using a cross-typological dataset of funicular form-found and statically determinate bridge structures, paired with text descriptions that capture the formal and structural features of each bridge. Results demonstrate that Text2Structure3D generates equilibrium structures with strong adherence to text-based specifications and greatly improves generalization capabilities compared to parametric model-based approaches. Text2Structure3D represents an early step toward a general-purpose foundation model for structural design, enabling the integration of generative AI into conceptual design workflows.</p></details> |  |

However, benchmarking practices remain fragmented, often relying on narrow, task-specific datasets and inconsistent evaluation protocols, which hampers reproducibility and broader progress. To address this, we introduce GraphBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that spans diverse domains and prediction tasks, including node-level, edge-level, graph-level, and generative settings. GraphBench provides standardized evaluation protocols -- with consistent dataset splits and performance metrics that account for out-of-distribution generalization -- as well as a unified hyperparameter tuning framework. Additionally, we benchmark GraphBench using message-passing neural networks and graph transformer models, providing principled baselines and establishing a reference performance.

| **[FairGE: Fairness-Aware Graph Encoding in Incomplete Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09394v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) are increasingly applied to social network analysis, yet their deployment is often constrained by fairness concerns. This issue is particularly critical in incomplete social networks, where sensitive attributes are frequently missing due to privacy and ethical restrictions. Existing solutions commonly generate these incomplete attributes, which may introduce additional biases and further compromise user privacy. To address this challenge, FairGE (Fair Graph Encoding) is introduced as a fairness-aware framework for GTs in incomplete social networks. Instead of generating sensitive attributes, FairGE encodes fairness directly through spectral graph theory. By leveraging the principal eigenvector to represent structural information and padding incomplete sensitive attributes with zeros to maintain independence, FairGE ensures fairness without data reconstruction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the method suppresses the influence of non-principal spectral components, thereby enhancing fairness. Extensive experiments on seven real-world social network datasets confirm that FairGE achieves at least a 16% improvement in both statistical parity and equality of opportunity compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The source code is shown in https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairGE.</p></details> | 12 pages, WWW 2026 |

However, existing methods may overlook the structural contextual information within each modality, making them vulnerable to interference from shallow features. To address these challenges, we propose MyGram, a modality-aware graph transformer with global distribution for multi-modal entity alignment. Specifically, we develop a modality diffusion learning module to capture deep structural contextual information within modalities and enable fine-grained multi-modal fusion. In addition, we introduce a Gram Loss that acts as a regularization constraint by minimizing the volume of a 4-dimensional parallelotope formed by multi-modal features, thereby achieving global distribution consistency across modalities. We conduct experiments on five public datasets. Results show that MyGram outperforms baseline models, achieving a maximum improvement of 4.8% in Hits@1 on FBDB15K, 9.9% on FBYG15K, and 4.3% on DBP15K.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Learning from Brain Topography: A Hierarchical Local-Global Graph-Transformer Network for EEG Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10525v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how local neurophysiological patterns interact with global brain dynamics is essential for decoding human emotions from EEG signals. However, existing deep learning approaches often overlook the brain's intrinsic spatial organization, failing to simultaneously capture local topological relations and global dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose Neuro-HGLN, a Neurologically-informed Hierarchical Graph-Transformer Learning Network that integrates biologically grounded priors with hierarchical representation learning. Neuro-HGLN first constructs a spatial Euclidean prior graph based on physical electrode distances to serve as an anatomically grounded inductive bias. A learnable global dynamic graph is then introduced to model functional connectivity across the entire brain. In parallel, to capture fine-grained regional dependencies, Neuro-HGLN builds region-level local graphs using a multi-head self-attention mechanism. These graphs are processed synchronously through local-constrained parallel GCN layers to produce region-specific representations. Subsequently, an iTransformer encoder aggregates these features to capture cross-region dependencies under a dimension-as-token formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neuro-HGLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, providing enhanced interpretability grounded in neurophysiological structure. These results highlight the efficacy of unifying local topological learning with cross-region dependency modeling for robust EEG emotion recognition.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a unified benchmarking framework that decouples PEs from architectural choices, enabling a fair comparison across 8 GNN and Transformer models, 9 PEs, and 10 synthetic and real-world datasets. Across more than 500 model-PE-dataset configurations, we find that commonly used expressiveness proxies, including Weisfeiler-Lehman distinguishability, do not reliably predict downstream performance. In particular, highly expressive PEs frequently fail to improve, and can even degrade performance on real-world tasks. At the same time, we identify several simple and previously overlooked model-PE combinations that match or outperform recent state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate the strong task-dependence of PEs and underscore the need for empirical validation beyond theoretical expressiveness. To support reproducible research, we release an open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating PEs for graph learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at KDD 2026 Datasets & Benchmarks Track</p></details> |
| **[Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08251v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In heterogeneous graphs, we can observe complex structures such as tree-like or hierarchical structures. Recently, the hyperbolic space has been widely adopted in many studies to effectively learn these complex structures. Although these methods have demonstrated the advantages of the hyperbolic space in learning heterogeneous graphs, most existing methods still have several challenges. They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of HypHGT, and the results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification task, with significantly reduced training time and memory usage.</p></details> | 14pages, 9 figures |

Existing sensor nodes localization approaches heavily rely on anchor nodes within wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Anchor nodes are sensor nodes equipped with global positioning system (GPS) receivers and thus, have known locations. These anchor nodes operate as references to localize other sensor nodes. However, the presence of anchor nodes may not always be feasible in real-world IoT scenarios. Additionally, localization accuracy can be compromised by fluctuations in Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), particularly under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. To address these challenges, we propose UBiGTLoc, a Unified Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-Graph Transformer Localization framework. The proposed UBiGTLoc framework effectively localizes sensor nodes in both anchor-free and anchor-presence WSNs. The framework leverages BiLSTM networks to capture temporal variations in RSSI data and employs Graph Transformer layers to model spatial relationships between sensor nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that UBiGTLoc consistently outperforms existing methods and provides robust localization across both dense and sparse WSNs while relying solely on cost-effective RSSI data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and published in IEEE Internet of Things Journal</p></details> |
| **[Database Views as Explanations for Relational Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09482v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash, Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case of hetero-GNNs, and develop a model-specific approach via the notion of learnable masks. For comparison, we propose model-agnostic heuristic baselines and show that our approach is both more efficient and achieves better explanation quality in most cases. Our extensive empirical evaluation on the RelBench collection across diverse domains and record-level tasks demonstrates both the usefulness of our explanations and the efficiency of their generation.</p></details> |  |

One key challenge in enhancing graph transformers is strengthening the discriminative power of distinguishing isomorphisms of graphs, which plays a crucial role in boosting their predictive performances. To address this challenge, we introduce 'Topology-Informed Graph Transformer (TIGT)', a novel transformer enhancing both discriminative power in detecting graph isomorphisms and the overall performance of Graph Transformers. TIGT consists of four components: A topological positional embedding layer using non-isomorphic universal covers based on cyclic subgraphs of graphs to ensure unique graph representation: A dual-path message-passing layer to explicitly encode topological characteristics throughout the encoder layers: A global attention mechanism: And a graph information layer to recalibrate channel-wise graph features for better feature representation. TIGT outperforms previous Graph Transformers in classifying synthetic dataset aimed at distinguishing isomorphism classes of graphs. Additionally, mathematical analysis and empirical evaluations highlight our model's competitive edge over state-of-the-art Graph Transformers across various benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Geometry-grounded Representation Learning and Generative Modeling Workshop (GRaM) at ICML 2024</p></details> |

The workshops took place in Koblenz, Germany on June 10 as part of STAF (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). Graphs are common mathematical structures that are visual and intuitive. They constitute a natural and seamless way for system modeling in science, engineering, and beyond, including computer science, biology, and business process modeling. Graph computation models constitute a class of very high-level models where graphs are first-class citizens. The aim of the International GCM Workshop series is to bring together researchers interested in all aspects of computation models based on graphs and graph transformation.

| **[Sentient: Detecting APTs Via Capturing Indirect Dependencies and Behavioral Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06521v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are difficult to detect due to their complexity and stealthiness. To mitigate such attacks, many approaches model entities and their relationship using provenance graphs to detect the stealthy and persistent characteristics of APTs. However, existing detection methods suffer from the flaws of missing indirect dependencies, noisy complex scenarios, and missing behavioral logical associations, which make it difficult to detect complex scenarios and effectively identify stealthy threats. In this paper, we propose Sentient, an APT detection method that combines pre-training and intent analysis. It employs a graph transformer to learn structural and semantic information from provenance graphs to avoid missing indirect dependencies. We mitigate scenario noise by combining global and local information. Additionally, we design an Intent Analysis Module (IAM) to associate logical relationships between behaviors. Sentient is trained solely on easily obtainable benign data to detect malicious behaviors that deviate from benign behavioral patterns. We evaluated Sentient on three widely-used datasets covering real-world attacks and simulated attacks. Notably, compared to six state-of-the-art methods, Sentient achieved an average reduction of 44% in false positive rate(FPR) for detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Error Mitigation with Attention Graph Transformers for Burgers Equation Solvers on NISQ Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23817v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework augmented with learned error mitigation for solving the viscous Burgers equation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone. We discuss extensions of this approach to higher-dimensional Burgers systems and more general quantum partial differential equation solvers, highlighting learned error mitigation as a promising complement to physics-based noise reduction techniques on NISQ devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[QE-Catalytic: A Graph-Language Multimodal Base Model for Relaxed-Energy Prediction in Catalytic Adsorption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20084v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adsorption energy is a key descriptor of catalytic reactivity. It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa. To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[A hybrid global local computational framework for ship hull structural analysis using homogenized model and graph neural network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20020v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a computational framework for global local structural analysis of ship hull girders that integrates an equivalent single layer (ESL) model with a graph neural network (GNN). A coarse mesh homogenized ESL model efficiently predicts the global displacement field, from which degrees of freedom (DOFs) along stiffened panel boundaries are extracted. A global to local DOF mapping and reconstruction procedure is developed to recover detailed boundary kinematics for local analysis. The reconstructed DOFs, together with panel geometry and loading, serve as inputs to a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT), a subtype of GNN, which rapidly and accurately predicts the detailed stress and displacement fields for any panel within the hull girder. The HGT is trained using high fidelity 3D panel finite element model with reconstructed boundary conditions, enabling it to generalize across varying panel geometries, loadings, and boundary behaviors. Once trained, the framework requires only the global ESL solution in order to generate detailed local responses, making it highly suitable for optimization. Validation on three box beam case studies demonstrates that the global prediction error is governed by the coarse mesh ESL solution, while the HGT maintains high local accuracy and clearly outperforms conventional ESL based stress estimation method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fraud Detection Through Large-Scale Graph Clustering with Heterogeneous Link Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19061v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative fraud, where multiple fraudulent accounts coordinate to exploit online payment systems, poses significant challenges due to the formation of complex network structures. Traditional detection methods that rely solely on high-confidence identity links suffer from limited coverage, while approaches using all available linkages often result in fragmented graphs with reduced clustering effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based fraud detection framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale heterogeneous graph clustering through a principled link transformation approach. Our method distinguishes between \emph{hard links} (high-confidence identity relationships such as phone numbers, credit cards, and national IDs) and \emph{soft links} (behavioral associations including device fingerprints, cookies, and IP addresses). We introduce a graph transformation technique that first identifies connected components via hard links, merges them into super-nodes, and then reconstructs a weighted soft-link graph amenable to efficient embedding and clustering. The transformed graph is processed using LINE (Large-scale Information Network Embedding) for representation learning, followed by HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for density-based cluster discovery. Experiments on a real-world payment platform dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant graph size reduction (from 25 million to 7.7 million nodes), doubles the detection coverage compared to hard-link-only baselines, and maintains high precision across identified fraud clusters. Our framework provides a scalable and practical solution for industrial-scale fraud detection systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

The synergy between transformers and graph learning demonstrates strong performance and versatility across various graph-related tasks. This survey provides an in-depth review of recent progress and challenges in graph transformer research. We begin with foundational concepts of graphs and transformers. We then explore design perspectives of graph transformers, focusing on how they integrate graph inductive biases and graph attention mechanisms into the transformer architecture. Furthermore, we propose a taxonomy classifying graph transformers based on depth, scalability, and pre-training strategies, summarizing key principles for effective development of graph transformer models. Beyond technical analysis, we discuss the applications of graph transformer models for node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks, exploring their potential in other application scenarios as well. Finally, we identify remaining challenges in the field, such as scalability and efficiency, generalization and robustness, interpretability and explainability, dynamic and complex graphs, as well as data quality and diversity, charting future directions for graph transformer research.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |
| **[TAG-HGT: A Scalable and Cost-Effective Framework for Inductive Cold-Start Academic Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02381v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive cold-start recommendation remains the "Achilles' Heel" of industrial academic platforms, where thousands of new scholars join daily without historical interaction records. While recent Generative Graph Models (e.g., HiGPT, OFA) demonstrate promising semantic capabilities, their prohibitive inference latency (often exceeding 13 minutes per 1,000 requests) and massive computational costs render them practically undeployable for real-time, million-scale applications. To bridge this gap between generative quality and industrial scalability, we propose TAG-HGT, a cost-effective neuro-symbolic framework. Adopting a decoupled "Semantics-First, Structure-Refined" paradigm, TAG-HGT utilizes a frozen Large Language Model (DeepSeek-V3) as an offline semantic factory and distills its knowledge into a lightweight Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via Cross-View Contrastive Learning (CVCL). We present a key insight: while LLM semantics provide necessary global recall, structural signals offer the critical local discrimination needed to distinguish valid collaborators from semantically similar but socially unreachable strangers in dense embedding spaces. Validated under a strict Time-Machine Protocol on the massive OpenAlex dataset, TAG-HGT achieves a SOTA System Recall@10 of 91.97%, outperforming structure-only baselines by 20.7%. Most significantly, from an industrial perspective, TAG-HGT reduces inference latency by five orders of magnitude ($4.5 \times 10^{5}\times$) compared to generative baselines (from 780s down to 1.73 ms), and slashes inference costs from $\sim$$1.50 to $<$$0.001 per 1k queries. This 99.9% cost reduction democratizes high-precision academic recommendation.</p></details> | 8pages |
| **[Scaling Text2SQL via LLM-efficient Schema Filtering with Functional Dependency Graph Rerankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16083v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most modern Text2SQL systems prompt large language models (LLMs) with entire schemas -- mostly column information -- alongside the user's question. While effective on small databases, this approach fails on real-world schemas that exceed LLM context limits, even for commercial models. The recent Spider 2.0 benchmark exemplifies this with hundreds of tables and tens of thousands of columns, where existing systems often break. Current mitigations either rely on costly multi-step prompting pipelines or filter columns by ranking them against user's question independently, ignoring inter-column structure. To scale existing systems, we introduce \toolname, an open-source, LLM-efficient schema filtering framework that compacts Text2SQL prompts by (i) ranking columns with a query-aware LLM encoder enriched with values and metadata, (ii) reranking inter-connected columns via a lightweight graph transformer over functional dependencies, and (iii) selecting a connectivity-preserving sub-schema with a Steiner-tree heuristic. Experiments on real datasets show that \toolname achieves near-perfect recall and higher precision than CodeS, SchemaExP, Qwen rerankers, and embedding retrievers, while maintaining sub-second median latency and scaling to schemas with 23,000+ columns.

To address the over-smoothing problem in deep GNNs, global attention was initially introduced, eliminating the necessity for using deep GNNs. However, through empirical and theoretical analysis, we verify that the introduced global attention exhibits severe over-smoothing, causing node representations to become indistinguishable due to its inherent low-pass filtering. This effect is even stronger than that observed in GNNs. To mitigate this, we propose PageRank Transformer (ParaFormer), which features a PageRank-enhanced attention module designed to mimic the behavior of deep Transformers. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that ParaFormer mitigates over-smoothing by functioning as an adaptive-pass filter. Experiments show that ParaFormer achieves consistent performance improvements across both node classification and graph classification tasks on 11 datasets ranging from thousands to millions of nodes, validating its efficacy. The supplementary material, including code and appendix, can be found in https://github.com/chaohaoyuan/ParaFormer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WSDM 2026</p></details> |

However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.</p></details> |  |

These models extend traditional message-passing GNNs and Transformers by representing node and edge features as spherical tensors that transform under irreducible representations of the rotation group SO(3), ensuring that predictions change in physically meaningful ways under rotations of the input. This guide develops a complete, intuitive foundation for spherical equivariant modeling - from group representations and spherical harmonics, to tensor products, Clebsch-Gordan decomposition, and the construction of SO(3)-equivariant kernels. Building on this foundation, we construct the Tensor Field Network and SE(3)-Transformer architectures and explain how they perform equivariant message-passing and attention on geometric graphs. Through clear mathematical derivations and annotated code excerpts, this guide serves as a self-contained introduction for researchers and learners seeking to understand or implement spherical EGNNs for applications in chemistry, molecular property prediction, protein structure modeling, and generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a technical version of the article originally published in Alchemy Bio (99 pages, 46 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Taint Analysis for Graph APIs Focusing on Broken Access Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08947v4)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis for Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes of the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether a tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use Critical Pair Analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the Critical Pair Analysis is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final preprint (revision #3) for submission to ICGT 24 Special Issue in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Node-Level Graph Domain Adaptation by Alleviating Local Dependency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13149v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in machine learning methods on graphs. However, transferring knowledge effectively from one graph to another remains a critical challenge. This highlights the need for algorithms capable of applying information extracted from a source graph to an unlabeled target graph, a task known as unsupervised graph domain adaptation (GDA). One key difficulty in unsupervised GDA is conditional shift, which hinders transferability. In this paper, we show that conditional shift can be observed only if there exists local dependencies among node features. To support this claim, we perform a rigorous analysis and also further provide generalization bounds of GDA when dependent node features are modeled using markov chains. Guided by the theoretical findings, we propose to improve GDA by decorrelating node features, which can be specifically implemented through decorrelated GCN layers and graph transformer layers. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing not only substantial performance enhancements over baseline GDA methods but also clear visualizations of small intra-class distances in the learned representations.

| **[Towards Practical Large-scale Dynamical Heterogeneous Graph Embedding: Cold-start Resilient Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13120v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying dynamic heterogeneous graph embeddings in production faces key challenges of scalability, data freshness, and cold-start. This paper introduces a practical, two-stage solution that balances deep graph representation with low-latency incremental updates. Our framework combines HetSGFormer, a scalable graph transformer for static learning, with Incremental Locally Linear Embedding (ILLE), a lightweight, CPU-based algorithm for real-time updates. HetSGFormer captures global structure with linear scalability, while ILLE provides rapid, targeted updates to incorporate new data, thus avoiding costly full retraining. This dual approach is cold-start resilient, leveraging the graph to create meaningful embeddings from sparse data. On billion-scale graphs, A/B tests show HetSGFormer achieved up to a 6.11% lift in Advertiser Value over previous methods, while the ILLE module added another 3.22% lift and improved embedding refresh timeliness by 83.2%. Our work provides a validated framework for deploying dynamic graph learning in production environments.</p></details> |  |

Using CEEMDAN, we extract nine IMFs spanning high-frequency fluctuations to long-term trends. Each IMF is transformed into a graph using four time-series-to-graph methods: natural visibility, horizontal visibility, recurrence, and transition graphs. Topological analysis shows clear scale-dependent structure: high-frequency IMFs yield dense, highly connected small-world graphs, whereas low-frequency IMFs produce sparser networks with longer characteristic path lengths. Visibility-based methods are more sensitive to amplitude variability and typically generate higher clustering, while recurrence graphs better preserve temporal dependencies. These results provide guidance for designing GNN architectures tailored to the structural properties of decomposed components, supporting more effective predictive modeling of financial time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We present PROTON, a heterogeneous graph transformer that generates testable hypotheses across molecular, organoid, and clinical systems. To evaluate PROTON, we apply it to Parkinson's disease (PD), bipolar disorder (BD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In PD, PROTON linked genetic risk loci to genes essential for dopaminergic neuron survival and predicted pesticides toxic to patient-derived neurons, including the insecticide endosulfan, which ranked within the top 1.29% of predictions. In silico screens performed by PROTON reproduced six genome-wide $α$-synuclein experiments, including a split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system (normalized enrichment score [NES] = 2.30, FDR-adjusted $p < 1 \times 10^{-4}$), an ascorbate peroxidase proximity labeling assay (NES = 2.16, FDR $< 1 \times 10^{-4}$), and a high-depth targeted exome sequencing study in 496 synucleinopathy patients (NES = 2.13, FDR $< 1 \times 10^{-4}$). In BD, PROTON predicted calcitriol as a candidate drug that reversed proteomic alterations observed in cortical organoids derived from BD patients. In AD, we evaluated PROTON predictions in health records from $n = 610,524$ patients at Mass General Brigham, confirming that five PROTON-predicted drugs were associated with reduced seven-year dementia risk (minimum hazard ratio = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.53-0.75, $p < 1 \times 10^{-7}$). PROTON generated neurological hypotheses that were evaluated across molecular, organoid, and clinical systems, defining a path for AI-driven discovery in neurological disease.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEIST: A Graph Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics and Proteomics Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11152v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics have become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and gene expression at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.</p></details> |  |

However, the design of scalable and topology-aware node tokenization has lagged behind other modalities. This gap becomes critical as the quadratic complexity of full attention renders them impractical on large-scale graphs. Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as brain-inspired models, provided an energy-saving scheme to convert input intensity into discrete spike-based representations through event-driven spiking neurons. Inspired by these characteristics, we propose a linear-time Graph Transformer with Spiking Node Tokenization (GT-SNT) for node classification. By integrating multi-step feature propagation with SNNs, spiking node tokenization generates compact, locality-aware spike count embeddings as node tokens to avoid predefined codebooks and their utilization issues. The codebook guided self-attention leverages these tokens to perform node-to-token attention for linear-time global context aggregation. In experiments, we compare GT-SNT with other state-of-the-art baselines on node classification datasets ranging from small to large. Experimental results show that GT-SNT achieves comparable performances on most datasets and reaches up to 130x faster inference speed compared to other GTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026; Code is available at https://github.com/Zhhuizhe/GT-SNT</p></details> |
| **[An Efficient Graph-Transformer Operator for Learning Physical Dynamics with Manifolds Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10227v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient physical simulations are essential in science and engineering, yet traditional numerical solvers face significant challenges in computational cost when handling simulations across dynamic scenarios involving complex geometries, varying boundary/initial conditions, and diverse physical parameters. While deep learning offers promising alternatives, existing methods often struggle with flexibility and generalization, particularly on unstructured meshes, which significantly limits their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose PhysGTO, an efficient Graph-Transformer Operator for learning physical dynamics through explicit manifold embeddings in both physical and latent spaces. In the physical space, the proposed Unified Graph Embedding module aligns node-level conditions and constructs sparse yet structure-preserving graph connectivity to process heterogeneous inputs. In the latent space, PhysGTO integrates a lightweight flux-oriented message-passing scheme with projection-inspired attention to capture local and global dependencies, facilitating multilevel interactions among complex physical correlations. This design ensures linear complexity relative to the number of mesh points, reducing both the number of trainable parameters and computational costs in terms of floating-point operations (FLOPs), and thereby allowing efficient inference in real-time applications. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning eleven datasets, covering problems with unstructured meshes, transient flow dynamics, and large-scale 3D geometries. PhysGTO consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs, demonstrating superior flexibility, scalability, and generalization in a wide range of simulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/pengwei07/PhysGTO</p></details> |

In recent years, deep learning architectures have been introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of various TS-to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d) demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the required training data compared to the baseline methods.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Graph Deep Learning for Intracranial Aneurysm Blood Flow Simulation and Risk Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09013v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intracranial aneurysms remain a major cause of neurological morbidity and mortality worldwide, where rupture risk is tightly coupled to local hemodynamics particularly wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index. Conventional computational fluid dynamics simulations provide accurate insights but are prohibitively slow and require specialized expertise. Clinical imaging alternatives such as 4D Flow MRI offer direct in-vivo measurements, yet their spatial resolution remains insufficient to capture the fine-scale shear patterns that drive endothelial remodeling and rupture risk while being extremely impractical and expensive. We present a graph neural network surrogate model that bridges this gap by reproducing full-field hemodynamics directly from vascular geometries in less than one minute per cardiac cycle. Trained on a comprehensive dataset of high-fidelity simulations of patient-specific aneurysms, our architecture combines graph transformers with autoregressive predictions to accurately simulate blood flow, wall shear stress, and oscillatory shear index. The model generalizes across unseen patient geometries and inflow conditions without mesh-specific calibration. Beyond accelerating simulation, our framework establishes the foundation for clinically interpretable hemodynamic prediction. By enabling near real-time inference integrated with existing imaging pipelines, it allows direct comparison with hospital phase-diagram assessments and extends them with physically grounded, high-resolution flow fields. This work transforms high-fidelity simulations from an expert-only research tool into a deployable, data-driven decision support system. Our full pipeline delivers high-resolution hemodynamic predictions within minutes of patient imaging, without requiring computational specialists, marking a step-change toward real-time, bedside aneurysm analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards agent-based-model informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05764v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we present a framework for designing neural networks that remain consistent with the underlying principles of agent-based models. We begin by highlighting the limitations of standard neural differential equations in modeling complex systems, where physical invariants (like energy) are often absent but other constraints (like mass conservation, information locality, bounded rationality) must be enforced. To address this, we introduce Agent-Based-Model informed Neural Networks (ABM-NNs), which leverage restricted graph neural networks and hierarchical decomposition to learn interpretable, structure-preserving dynamics. We validate the framework across three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a generalized Generalized Lotka--Volterra system, where we recover ground-truth parameters from short trajectories in presence of interventions; (ii) a graph-based SIR contagion model, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning baselines (GCN, GraphSAGE, Graph Transformer) in out-of-sample forecasting and noise robustness; and (iii) a real-world macroeconomic model of the ten largest economies, where we learn coupled GDP dynamics from empirical data and demonstrate counterfactual analysis for policy interventions</p></details> |  |

While consistency has primarily been viewed as a binary property, i.e., a graph is consistent or inconsistent with respect to a set of constraints, recent work has presented an approach to consistency as a graduated property. This allows living with inconsistencies for a while and repairing them when necessary. For repairing inconsistencies in a graph, we use graph transformation rules with so-called {\em impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions} to understand how much repair gain certain rule applications would bring. Both types of conditions can be derived from given graph constraints. Our main theorem shows that the difference between the number of actual constraint violations before and after a graph transformation step can be characterised by the difference between the numbers of violated impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions. This theory forms the basis for algorithms with look-ahead that rank graph transformations according to their potential for graph repair. An evaluation shows that graph repair can be well-supported by rules with these new types of application conditions in terms of effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 25 Figures, new, more efficient method for constructing application conditions, theoretical comparison to other concepts of consistency, extended evaluation</p></details> |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning on Molecular Graphs: A Systematic Investigation of Masking Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07064v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) plays a central role in molecular representation learning. Yet, many recent innovations in masking-based pretraining are introduced as heuristics and lack principled evaluation, obscuring which design choices are genuinely effective. This work cast the entire pretrain-finetune workflow into a unified probabilistic framework, enabling a transparent comparison and deeper understanding of masking strategies. Building on this formalism, we conduct a controlled study of three core design dimensions: masking distribution, prediction target, and encoder architecture, under rigorously controlled settings. We further employ information-theoretic measures to assess the informativeness of pretraining signals and connect them to empirically benchmarked downstream performance. Our findings reveal a surprising insight: sophisticated masking distributions offer no consistent benefit over uniform sampling for common node-level prediction tasks. Instead, the choice of prediction target and its synergy with the encoder architecture are far more critical. Specifically, shifting to semantically richer targets yields substantial downstream improvements, particularly when paired with expressive Graph Transformer encoders. These insights offer practical guidance for developing more effective SSL methods for molecular graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMAGT: Unveiling miRNA-Drug Associations by Integrating SMILES and RNA Sequence Structures through Graph Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05287v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MiRNAs, due to their role in gene regulation, have paved a new pathway for pharmacology, focusing on drug development that targets miRNAs. However, traditional wet lab experiments are limited by efficiency and cost constraints, making it difficult to extensively explore potential associations between developed drugs and target miRNAs. Therefore, we have designed a novel machine learning model based on a multi-layer transformer-based graph neural network, DMAGT, specifically for predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. This model transforms drug-miRNA associations into graphs, employs Word2Vec for embedding features of drug molecular structures and miRNA base structures, and leverages a graph transformer model to learn from embedded features and relational structures, ultimately predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. To evaluate DMAGT, we tested its performance on three datasets composed of drug-miRNA associations: ncDR, RNAInter, and SM2miR, achieving up to AUC of $95.24\pm0.05$. DMAGT demonstrated superior performance in comparative experiments tackling similar challenges. To validate its practical efficacy, we specifically focused on two drugs, namely 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin. Of the 20 potential drug-miRNA associations identified as the most likely, 14 were successfully validated. The above experiments demonstrate that DMAGT has an excellent performance and stability in predicting drug-miRNA associations, providing a new shortcut for miRNA drug development.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

We propose continuous neurocognitive monitoring via smartphone speech analysis integrated with Relational Graph Transformer (RELGT) architectures. Proof-of-concept in phenylketonuria (PKU) shows speech-derived "Proficiency in Verbal Discourse" correlates with blood phenylalanine (p = -0.50, p < 0.005) but not standard cognitive tests (all |r| < 0.35). RELGT could overcome information bottlenecks in heterogeneous medical data (speech, labs, assessments), enabling predictive alerts weeks before decompensation. Key challenges: multi-disease validation, clinical workflow integration, equitable multilingual deployment. Success would transform episodic neurology into continuous personalized monitoring for millions globally.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence. With its superior performance, efficiency, and architectural novelty, GVT not only presents a compelling alternative to diffusion models but also establishes a strong new baseline for the field, paving the way for future research in discrete latent-space molecular generation.</p></details> |  |

However, fully utilizing the multi-domain characteristics of EEG signals remains a significant challenge. Traditional single-perspective analyses often fail to capture the complex interplay of temporal, frequency, and spatial dimensions in EEG data. To address this, we introduce a multi-view graph transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations that integrates information across three domains: temporal dynamics from continuous series, frequency features extracted from frequency bands, and inter-channel relationships captured through several spatial encodings. This comprehensive approach allows model to capture the nuanced properties inherent in EEG signals, enhancing its flexibility and representational power. Evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrates that MVGT surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance. The results highlight its ability to extract multi-domain information and effectively model inter-channel relationships, showcasing its potential for EEG-based emotion recognition tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICONIP 2025 (Oral). 16 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Recent progress in deep learning has introduced increasingly sophisticated architectures for capturing relational dependencies within graph-structured data. In this work, we propose the Generalized Graph Transformer Variational Autoencoder (GGT-VAE). Our model integrates Generalized Graph Transformer Architecture with Variational Autoencoder framework for link prediction. Unlike prior GraphVAE, GCN, or GNN approaches, GGT-VAE leverages transformer style global self-attention mechanism along with laplacian positional encoding to model structural patterns across nodes into a latent space without relying on message passing. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GGT-VAE consistently achieves above-baseline performance in terms of ROC-AUC and Average Precision. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to explore graph structure generation using a generalized graph transformer backbone in a variational framework.</p></details> |  |

To identify and stop cyber threats, efficient data collection methods are necessary. This research presents an innovative method to cloud security by integrating numerous data sources and modalities with multi-modal deep learning autoencoders. The Multi-Modal Deep Learning Ensemble Architecture (MMDLEA), a unique approach for anomaly detection and classification in multi-modal data, is proposed in this study. The proposed design integrates the best features of six deep learning models: Multi-Modal Deep Learning Autoencoder (MMDLA), Anomaly Detection using Adaptive Metric Learning (ADAM), ADADELTA, ADAGRAD, RMSPROP, and Stacked Graph Transformer (SGT). A final prediction is produced by combining the outputs of all the models, each of which is trained using a distinct modality of the data. Based on the test dataset, the recommended MMDLA architecture achieves an accuracy of 98.5% and an F1-score of 0.985, demonstrating its superior performance over each individual model. Of the different models, the ADAM model performs the best, with an accuracy of 96.2% and an F1-score of 0.962. With an F1-score of 0.955 and an accuracy of 95.5%, the ADADELTA model trails closely behind. MMDLA obtains an F1-score of 0.948 and an accuracy of 94.8%. Additionally, the suggested MMDLEA design exhibits enhanced resilience to fluctuating modalities and noisy data, proving its usefulness in practical settings. Future study in this area is made possible by the results, which show the potential of the proposed framework for abnormal identification and categorization in multi-modal data.</p></details> | 13 pages |

This limitation has led some researchers to advocate Graph Transformers as a better alternative, whereas others suggest that it can be mitigated within the MPNN framework, using virtual nodes or other rewiring techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that oversquashing is not limited to long-range tasks, but can also arise in short-range problems. This observation allows us to disentangle two distinct mechanisms underlying oversquashing: (1) the bottleneck phenomenon, which can arise even in low-range settings, and (2) the vanishing gradient phenomenon, which is closely associated with long-range tasks. We further show that the short-range bottleneck effect is not captured by existing explanations for oversquashing, and that adding virtual nodes does not resolve it. In contrast, transformers do succeed in such tasks, positioning them as the more compelling solution to oversquashing, compared to specialized MPNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Learning on Graphs (LoG) 2025.

However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.</p></details> | 14 pages.

We present Agint, an agentic graph compiler, interpreter, and runtime that incrementally and hierarchically converts natural-language instructions into typed, effect-aware code DAGs. Agint introduces explicit type floors (text to data to spec to code) grounded in semantic graph transformations and a hybrid LLM and function-based JIT runtime. This enables dynamic graph refinement, reproducible and optimizable execution, speculative evaluation, and interoperability with existing developer tools. Agint's typed graph bindings improve reliability and allow concurrent composition of concurrent codebases by construction, supporting accelerated development with smaller and faster models, lower latency, efficient context utilization, and higher throughput. Hierarchical compilation allows scalable graph edits, while the graph structure supports reproducibility and efficient parallel generation. Agint provides a composable unix-style toolchain: dagify (DAG compiler), dagent (hybrid JIT runtime), schemagin (schema generator), and datagin (data transformer) for realtime, low-latency code and dataflow creation. Human developers and coding agents refine graphs through the Agint CLI, while non-technical users use Agint Flow GUI for visual editing, conversational refinement, and debugging to promote prototype agentic workflows to production code. This continuous co-creation model allows teams to prototype quickly, refine seamlessly, and deploy reliably, bridging natural language, compiler methods, and developer tooling to enable a new generation of composable, team-centric coding agents at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, NeurIPS 2025: Deep Learning for Code in the Agentic Era</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we introduce GRIT-LP, a graph transformer explicitly designed for polar ice-layer thickness estimation from polar radar imagery. Accurately estimating ice layer thickness is critical for understanding snow accumulation, reconstructing past climate patterns and reducing uncertainties in projections of future ice sheet evolution and sea level rise. GRIT-LP combines an inductive geometric graph learning framework with self-attention mechanism, and introduces two major innovations that jointly address challenges in modeling the spatio-temporal patterns of ice layers: a partitioned spatial graph construction strategy that forms overlapping, fully connected local neighborhoods to preserve spatial coherence and suppress noise from irrelevant long-range links, and a long-range skip connection mechanism within the transformer that improves information flow and mitigates oversmoothing in deeper attention layers. We conducted extensive experiments, demonstrating that GRIT-LP outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with a 24.92\% improvement in root mean squared error. These results highlight the effectiveness of graph transformers in modeling spatiotemporal patterns by capturing both localized structural features and long-range dependencies across internal ice layers, and demonstrate their potential to advance data-driven understanding of cryospheric processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[PDDFormer: Pairwise Distance Distribution Graph Transformer for Crystal Material Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12984v5)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crystal structures can be simplified as a periodic point set that repeats across three-dimensional space along an underlying lattice. Traditionally, crystal representation methods characterize the structure using descriptors such as lattice parameters, symmetry, and space groups. However, in reality, atoms in materials always vibrate above absolute zero, causing their positions to fluctuate continuously. This dynamic behavior disrupts the fundamental periodicity of the lattice, making crystal graphs based on static lattice parameters and conventional descriptors discontinuous under slight perturbations. Chemists proposed the pairwise distance distribution (PDD) method to address this problem. However, the completeness of PDD requires defining a large number of neighboring atoms, leading to high computational costs. Additionally, PDD does not account for atomic information, making it challenging to apply it directly to crystal material property prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the atom-Weighted Pairwise Distance Distribution (WPDD) and Unit cell Pairwise Distance Distribution (UPDD) and apply them to the construction of multi-edge crystal graphs. We demonstrate the continuity and general completeness of crystal graphs under slight atomic position perturbations. Moreover, by modeling PDD as global information and integrating it into matrix-based message passing, we significantly reduce computational costs. Comprehensive evaluation results show that WPDDFormer achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across tasks on benchmark datasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS-DFT.</p></details> | 15pages,8 figures |
| **[Mesh-based Super-resolution of Detonation Flows with Multiscale Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12041v3)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Super-resolution flow reconstruction using state-of-the-art data-driven techniques is valuable for a variety of applications, such as subgrid/subfilter closure modeling, accelerating spatiotemporal forecasting, data compression, and serving as an upscaling tool for sparse experimental measurements. In the present work, a first-of-its-kind multiscale graph transformer approach is developed for mesh-based super-resolution (SR-GT) of reacting flows. The novel data-driven modeling paradigm leverages a graph-based flow-field representation compatible with complex geometries and non-uniform/unstructured grids. Further, the transformer backbone captures long-range dependencies between different parts of the low-resolution flow-field, identifies important features, and then generates the super-resolved flow-field that preserves those features at a higher resolution. The performance of SR-GT is demonstrated in the context of spectral-element-discretized meshes for a challenging test problem of 2D detonation propagation within a premixed hydrogen-air mixture exhibiting highly complex multiscale reacting flow behavior. The SR-GT framework utilizes a unique element + neighborhood graph representation for the coarse input, which is then tokenized before being processed by the transformer component to produce the fine output. It is demonstrated that SR-GT provides high super-resolution accuracy for reacting flow-field features and superior performance compared to traditional interpolation-based SR schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient LLM-aware Heterogeneous Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17923v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs are widely present in real-world complex networks, where the diversity of node and relation types leads to complex and rich semantics. Efforts for modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs are restricted by the limitations of predefined semantic dependencies and the scarcity of supervised signals. The advanced pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm leverages graph structure to provide rich self-supervised signals, but introduces semantic gaps between tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential to address the semantic issues of relations and tasks in heterogeneous graphs through their strong reasoning capabilities in textual modality, but their incorporation into heterogeneous graphs is largely limited by computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Efficient LLM-Aware (ELLA) framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the above issues. To capture complex relation semantics, we propose an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer that leverages LLM to encode multi-hop, multi-type relations. To reduce computational complexity, we further employ a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer, which help reduces the complexity of LLM-aware relation reasoning from exponential to linear. To bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we introduce the fine-grained task-aware textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Extensive experiments on four heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed ELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the performance and efficiency. In particular, ELLA scales up to 13b-parameter LLMs and achieves up to a 4x speedup compared with existing LLM-based methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/l-wd/ELLA.</p></details> |  |

Today, ZX-calculus, a computing model for quantum circuit transformation, is attracting attention for its highly abstract graph-based approach. Whereas existing tools such as PyZX and Quantomatic offer domain-specific support for quantum circuit optimization, visualization and theorem-proving, we present a complementary approach using LMNtal, a general-purpose hierarchical graph rewriting language, to establish a diagrammatic transformation and verification platform with model checking. Our methodology shows three advantages: (1) manipulation of ZX-diagrams through native graph transformation rules, enabling direct implementation of basic rules; (2) quantified pattern matching via QLMNtal extensions, greatly simplifying rule specification; and (3) interactive visualization and validation of optimization paths through state space exploration. Through case studies, we demonstrate how our framework helps understand optimization paths and design new algorithms and strategies. This suggests that the declarative language LMNtal and its toolchain could serve as a new platform to investigate quantum circuit transformation from a different perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 27 figures.

| **[BrainHGT: A Hierarchical Graph Transformer for Interpretable Brain Network Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17604v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformer shows remarkable potential in brain network analysis due to its ability to model graph structures and complex node relationships. Most existing methods typically model the brain as a flat network, ignoring its modular structure, and their attention mechanisms treat all brain region connections equally, ignoring distance-related node connection patterns. However, brain information processing is a hierarchical process that involves local and long-range interactions between brain regions, interactions between regions and sub-functional modules, and interactions among functional modules themselves. This hierarchical interaction mechanism enables the brain to efficiently integrate local computations and global information flow, supporting the execution of complex cognitive functions. To address this issue, we propose BrainHGT, a hierarchical Graph Transformer that simulates the brain's natural information processing from local regions to global communities. Specifically, we design a novel long-short range attention encoder that utilizes parallel pathways to handle dense local interactions and sparse long-range connections, thereby effectively alleviating the over-globalizing issue. To further capture the brain's modular architecture, we designe a prior-guided clustering module that utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to group brain regions into functional communities and leverage neuroanatomical prior to guide the clustering process, thereby improving the biological plausibility and interpretability. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method significantly improves performance of disease identification, and can reliably capture the sub-functional modules of the brain, demonstrating its interpretability.</p></details> |  |

First, they typically rely on assumptions leading to decay properties of local agent interactions, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies such as cascading power failures or epidemic outbreaks. Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures. Further, to improve credit assignment during training, STACCA integrates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator that is compatible with state-value critic estimates. We evaluate STACCA on epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks, demonstrating improved performance, network generalization, and scalability. These results highlight the potential of transformer-based MARL architectures to achieve scalable and generalizable control in large-scale networked systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted for review</p></details> |
| **[Are Graph Transformers Necessary? Efficient Long-Range Message Passing with Fractal Nodes in MPNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13010v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, but often struggle to balance local and global information. While graph Transformers aim to address this by enabling long-range interactions, they often overlook the inherent locality and efficiency of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). We propose a new concept called fractal nodes, inspired by the fractal structure observed in real-world networks. Our approach is based on the intuition that graph partitioning naturally induces fractal structure, where subgraphs often reflect the connectivity patterns of the full graph. Fractal nodes are designed to coexist with the original nodes and adaptively aggregate subgraph-level feature representations, thereby enforcing feature similarity within each subgraph. We show that fractal nodes alleviate the over-squashing problem by providing direct shortcut connections that enable long-range propagation of subgraph-level representations. Experiment results show that our method improves the expressive power of MPNNs and achieves comparable or better performance to graph Transformers while maintaining the computational efficiency of MPNN by improving the long-range dependencies of MPNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026 for Oral Representation.

| **[Hierarchical Frequency-Decomposition Graph Neural Networks for Road Network Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12507v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road networks are critical infrastructures underpinning intelligent transportation systems and their related applications. Effective representation learning of road networks remains challenging due to the complex interplay between spatial structures and frequency characteristics in traffic patterns. Existing graph neural networks for modeling road networks predominantly fall into two paradigms: spatial-based methods that capture local topology but tend to over-smooth representations, and spectral-based methods that analyze global frequency components but often overlook localized variations. This spatial-spectral misalignment limits their modeling capacity for road networks exhibiting both coarse global trends and fine-grained local fluctuations. To bridge this gap, we propose HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical frequency-decomposition graph neural network that unifies spatial and spectral modeling. HiFiNet constructs a multi-level hierarchy of virtual nodes to enable localized frequency analysis, and employs a decomposition-updating-reconstruction framework with a topology-aware graph transformer to separately model and fuse low- and high-frequency signals. Theoretically justified and empirically validated on multiple real-world datasets across four downstream tasks, HiFiNet demonstrates superior performance and generalization ability in capturing effective road network representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Aware Retrieval Augmentation for Dynamic Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12495v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic recommendation systems aim to provide personalized suggestions by modeling temporal user-item interactions across time-series behavioral data. Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained dynamic graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn user-item representations over temporal snapshot graphs. However, fine-tuning GNNs on these graphs often results in generalization issues due to temporal discrepancies between pre-training and fine-tuning stages, limiting the model's ability to capture evolving user preferences. To address this, we propose TarDGR, a task-aware retrieval-augmented framework designed to enhance generalization capability by incorporating task-aware model and retrieval-augmentation. Specifically, TarDGR introduces a Task-Aware Evaluation Mechanism to identify semantically relevant historical subgraphs, enabling the construction of task-specific datasets without manual labeling. It also presents a Graph Transformer-based Task-Aware Model that integrates semantic and structural encodings to assess subgraph relevance. During inference, TarDGR retrieves and fuses task-aware subgraphs with the query subgraph, enriching its representation and mitigating temporal generalization issues. Experiments on multiple large-scale dynamic graph datasets demonstrate that TarDGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with extensive empirical evidence underscoring its superior accuracy and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[Understanding and Estimating the Execution Time of Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15631v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the scarcity of quantum computing resources, researchers and developers have very limited access to real quantum computers. Therefore, judicious planning and utilization of quantum computer runtime are essential to ensure smooth execution and completion of projects. Accurate estimation of a quantum circuit's execution time is thus necessary to prevent unexpectedly exceeding the anticipated runtime or the maximum capacity of the quantum computers; it also allows quantum computing platforms to make precisely informed provisioning and prioritization of quantum computing jobs. In this paper, we first study the characteristics of quantum circuits' runtime on simulators and real quantum computers. Then, we introduce an innovative method that employs a graph transformer-based model, utilizing the graph information and global information of quantum circuits to estimate their execution time. We selected a benchmark dataset comprising over 1,510 quantum circuits, initially predicting their execution times on simulators, which yielded promising results with an R-squared value greater than 95%. Subsequently, we applied active learning to select 340 circuit samples with a confidence level of 95% to build and evaluate our approach for the estimation of circuit execution times on quantum computers, achieving an average R-squared value exceeding 90%. Our approach can be integrated into quantum computing platforms to provide an accurate estimation of quantum execution time and be used as a reference for prioritizing quantum execution jobs. In addition, our findings provide insights for quantum program developers to optimize their circuits for reduced execution time.</p></details> |  |
| **[MP-GFormer: A 3D-Geometry-Aware Dynamic Graph Transformer Approach for Machining Process Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11837v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machining process planning (MP) is inherently complex due to structural and geometrical dependencies among part features and machining operations. A key challenge lies in capturing dynamic interdependencies that evolve with distinct part geometries as operations are performed. Machine learning has been applied to address challenges in MP, such as operation selection and machining sequence prediction. Dynamic graph learning (DGL) has been widely used to model dynamic systems, thanks to its ability to integrate spatio-temporal relationships. However, in MP, while existing DGL approaches can capture these dependencies, they fail to incorporate three-dimensional (3D) geometric information of parts and thus lack domain awareness in predicting machining operation sequences. To address this limitation, we propose MP-GFormer, a 3D-geometry-aware dynamic graph transformer that integrates evolving 3D geometric representations into DGL through an attention mechanism to predict machining operation sequences. Our approach leverages StereoLithography surface meshes representing the 3D geometry of a part after each machining operation, with the boundary representation method used for the initial 3D designs. We evaluate MP-GFormer on a synthesized dataset and demonstrate that the method achieves improvements of 24\% and 36\% in accuracy for main and sub-operation predictions, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[NTSFormer: A Self-Teaching Graph Transformer for Multimodal Isolated Cold-Start Node Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04870v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Isolated cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because such nodes have no edges and often have missing modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for isolated cold-start inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However, this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student" prediction based only on self information (i.e., the node's own features), and a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature data into token sequences, which are then processed by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion. Experiments on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior performance for multimodal isolated cold-start node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We introduce Solvaformer, a geometry-aware graph transformer that models solutions as multiple molecules with independent SE(3) symmetries. The architecture combines intramolecular SE(3)-equivariant attention with intermolecular scalar attention, enabling cross-molecular communication without imposing spurious relative geometry. We train Solvaformer in a multi-task setting to predict both solubility (log S) and solvation free energy, using an alternating-batch regimen that trains on quantum-mechanical data (CombiSolv-QM) and on experimental measurements (BigSolDB 2.0). Solvaformer attains the strongest overall performance among the learned models and approaches a DFT-assisted gradient-boosting baseline, while outperforming an EquiformerV2 ablation and sequence-based alternatives. In addition, token-level attention produces chemically coherent attributions: case studies recover known intra- vs. inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding patterns that govern solubility differences in positional isomers. Taken together, Solvaformer provides an accurate, scalable, and interpretable approach to solution-phase property prediction by uniting geometric inductive bias with a mixed dataset training strategy on complementary computational and experimental data.</p></details> |  |

Public benchmarks remain significantly smaller and hand-crafted, while releasing truly malicious RTL raises ethical and operational risks. This work presents an automated and scalable methodology for generating HT-like patterns in industry-scale netlists whose purpose is to stress-test detection tools without altering user-visible functionality. The pipeline (i) parses large gate-level designs into connectivity graphs, (ii) explores rare regions using SCOAP testability metrics, and (iii) applies parameterized, function-preserving graph transformations to synthesize trigger-payload pairs that mimic the statistical footprint of stealthy HTs. When evaluated on the benchmarks generated in this work, representative state-of-the-art graph-learning models fail to detect Trojans. The framework closes the evaluation gap between academic circuits and modern SoCs by providing reproducible challenge instances that advance security research without sharing step-by-step attack instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in DATE 2026</p></details> |

Existing expressivity results are often tied to specific design choices and lack comprehensive empirical validation on large-scale data. This leaves a gap between theory and practice, preventing generalizable insights that exceed particular application domains. Here, we propose the Generalized-Distance Transformer (GDT), a GT architecture using standard attention that incorporates many advancements for GTs from recent years, and develop a fine-grained understanding of the GDT's representation power in terms of attention and PEs. Through extensive experiments, we identify design choices that consistently perform well across various applications, tasks, and model scales, demonstrating strong performance in a few-shot transfer setting without fine-tuning. Our evaluation covers over eight million graphs with roughly 270M tokens across diverse domains, including image-based object detection, molecular property prediction, code summarization, and out-of-distribution algorithmic reasoning. We distill our theoretical and practical findings into several generalizable insights about effective GT design, training, and inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 as spotlight</p></details> |
| **[QAGT-MLP: An Attention-Based Graph Transformer for Small and Large-Scale Quantum Error Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03119v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Noisy quantum devices demand error-mitigation techniques to be accurate yet simple and efficient in terms of number of shots and processing time. Many established approaches (e.g., extrapolation and quasi-probability cancellation) impose substantial execution or calibration overheads, while existing learning-based methods have difficulty scaling to large and deep circuits. In this research, we introduce QAGT-MLP: an attention-based graph transformer tailored for small- and large-scale quantum error mitigation (QEM). QAGT-MLP encodes each quantum circuit as a graph whose nodes represent gate instances and whose edges capture qubit connectivity and causal adjacency. A dual-path attention module extracts features around measured qubits at two scales or contexts: 1) graph-wide global structural context; and 2) fine-grained local lightcone context. These learned representations are concatenated with circuit-level descriptor features and the circuit noisy expected values, then they are passed to a lightweight MLP to predict the noise-mitigated values. On large-scale 100-qubit Trotterized 1D Transverse-Field Ising Models -- TFIM circuits -- the proposed QAGT-MLP outperformed state-of-the-art learning baselines in terms of mean error and error variability, demonstrating strong validity and applicability in real-world QEM scenarios under matched shot budgets. By using attention to fuse global structures with local lightcone neighborhoods, QAGT-MLP achieves high mitigation quality without the increasing noise scaling or resource demand required by classical QEM pipelines, while still offering a scalable and practical path to QEM in modern and future quantum workloads.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Particle-System Random Batch Methods Enhance Graph Transformer: Memory Efficiency and Parallel Computing Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06044v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanism is a significant part of Transformer models. It helps extract features from embedded vectors by adding global information and its expressivity has been proved to be powerful. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity restricts its practicability. Although several researches have provided attention mechanism in sparse form, they are lack of theoretical analysis about the expressivity of their mechanism while reducing complexity. In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity. Other than this, it can be implemented in parallel on a new dimension, which contributes to much memory saving. (2) Random Batch Attention mechanism can improve most of the existing models by replacing their attention mechanisms, even many previously improved attention mechanisms. (3) Random Batch Attention mechanism has theoretical explanation in convergence, as it comes from Random Batch Methods on computation mathematics. Experiments on large graphs have proved advantages mentioned above. Also, the theoretical modeling of self-attention mechanism is a new tool for future research on attention-mechanism analysis.</p></details> |  |

This non-invasive method has gained traction across diverse domains, including telemedicine, affective computing, driver fatigue detection, and health monitoring, owing to its scalability and convenience. Despite significant progress in remote physiological signal measurement, a crucial characteristic - the intrinsic periodicity - has often been underexplored or insufficiently modeled in previous approaches, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose Reperio-rPPG, a novel framework that strategically integrates Relational Convolutional Networks with a Graph Transformer to effectively capture the periodic structure inherent in physiological signals. Additionally, recognizing the limited diversity of existing rPPG datasets, we further introduce a tailored CutMix augmentation to enhance the model's generalizability. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used benchmark datasets - PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD - demonstrate that Reperio-rPPG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits remarkable robustness under various motion (e.g., stationary, rotation, talking, walking) and illumination conditions (e.g., nature, low LED, high LED).

While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2) transformer representations refine GNN message passing through attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with 6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling, with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein representations through learnable diffusion.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods for training such models still rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted, self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels. Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous Verified Semantic Caching for Tiered LLM Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13165v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) now sit in the critical path of search, assistance, and agentic workflows, making semantic caching essential for reducing inference cost and latency. Production deployments typically use a tiered static-dynamic design: a static cache of curated, offline vetted responses mined from logs, backed by a dynamic cache populated online. In practice, both tiers are commonly governed by a single embedding similarity threshold, which induces a hard tradeoff: conservative thresholds miss safe reuse opportunities, while aggressive thresholds risk serving semantically incorrect responses. We introduce \textbf{Krites}, an asynchronous, LLM-judged caching policy that expands static coverage without changing serving decisions. On the critical path, Krites behaves exactly like a standard static threshold policy. When the nearest static neighbor of the prompt falls just below the static threshold, Krites asynchronously invokes an LLM judge to verify whether the static response is acceptable for the new prompt. Approved matches are promoted into the dynamic cache, allowing future repeats and paraphrases to reuse curated static answers and expanding static reach over time. In trace-driven simulations on conversational and search workloads, Krites increases the fraction of requests served with curated static answers (direct static hits plus verified promotions) by up to $\textbf{3.9}$ times for conversational traffic and search-style queries relative to tuned baselines, with unchanged critical path latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantization-Robust LLM Unlearning via Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13151v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to remove targeted knowledge from a trained model, but practical deployments often require post-training quantization (PTQ) for efficient inference. However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0). Thus, using LoRA for Machine Unlearning is beneficial for scenarios where quantization is necessary for model deployment.</p></details> |  |

Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCOPE: Selective Conformal Optimized Pairwise LLM Judging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13110v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to replace costly human preference labels in pairwise evaluation. Despite their practicality, LLM judges remain prone to miscalibration and systematic biases. This paper proposes SCOPE (Selective Conformal Optimized Pairwise Evaluation), a framework for selective pairwise judging with finite-sample statistical guarantees. Under exchangeability, SCOPE calibrates an acceptance threshold such that the error rate among non-abstained judgments is at most a user-specified level $α$. To provide SCOPE with a bias-neutral uncertainty signal, we introduce Bidirectional Preference Entropy (BPE), which queries the judge under both response positions, aggregates the implied preference probabilities to enforce invariance to response order, and converts the aggregated probability into an entropy-based uncertainty score. Across MT-Bench, RewardBench, and Chatbot Arena, BPE improves uncertainty quality over standard confidence proxies, providing a stronger selection signal that enables SCOPE to consistently meet the target risk level while retaining good coverage across judge scales. In particular, at $α= 0.10$, \textsc{Scope} consistently satisfies the risk bound across all benchmarks and judge scales (empirical risk $\approx 0.097$ to $0.099$), while retaining substantial coverage, reaching $0.89$ on RewardBench with Qwen-14B and $0.98$ on RewardBench with Qwen-32B. Compared to naïve baselines, \textsc{Scope} accepts up to $2.4\times$ more judgments on MT-Bench with Qwen-7B under the same target risk constraint, demonstrating that BPE enables reliable and high-coverage LLM-based evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Diverse: Mitigating Diversity Illusion in Self-Play LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13103v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-play bootstraps LLM reasoning through an iterative Challenger-Solver loop: the Challenger is trained to generate questions that target the Solver's capabilities, and the Solver is optimized on the generated data to expand its reasoning skills. However, existing frameworks like R-Zero often exhibit non-sustained improvement, where early gains degrade as self-play continues. We identify a key failure mode, Diversity Illusion, where the Solver's training signals appear diverse yet collapse into recurring underlying patterns. It manifests as (1) Local Diversity Illusion, where diversity is enforced only within-batch, inducing cross-iteration mode cycling; and (2) Surface Diversity Illusion, where questions vary superficially but require near-identical reasoning skills. To mitigate them, we propose R-Diverse with two aligned innovations: Memory-Augmented Penalty (MAP), which uses a persistent memory bank to discourage recycling across iterations, and Skill-Aware Measurement (SAM), which evaluates diversity by the reasoning skills exercised rather than surface variation of questions. Across 10 math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Diverse sustains gains over more iterations and consistently outperforms prior self-play methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Gengsheng-Li/R-Diverse.</p></details> |  |

Caching inference responses, allowing them to be retrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one possible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the semantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation. Semantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic similarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem: one must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached responses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities and serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing semantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations and unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a principled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown query and cost distributions. We formulate both offline optimization and online learning variants of the problem, and develop provably efficient algorithms with state-of-the-art guarantees. We also evaluate our framework on a synthetic dataset, showing that our proposed algorithms perform matching or superior performance compared with baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to INFOCOM 2026</p></details> |

However, MeBP requires backward computation through all transformer layers at every step, where weight decompression alone accounts for 32--42% of backward time. We propose Layer-Cyclic Selective Backpropagation (LCSB), which computes gradients for only a subset of layers per step. Our key insight is that residual connections guarantee gradient flow through identity paths, while AdamW momentum provides implicit updates for non-selected layers. We interpret LCSB as Block Coordinate Descent on the LoRA parameter space, providing theoretical justification for convergence. LCSB achieves up to 1.40$\times$ speedup with less than 2\% quality degradation across five models and three tasks. Surprisingly, in 4-bit quantized settings, LCSB exhibits superior stability: a 3B model that completely diverges under full backpropagation converges smoothly with LCSB, suggesting an implicit regularization effect from selective gradient computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under the review, 13 pages</p></details> |

This shift raises significant concerns, including the undermining of skill evaluations, the mass-production of low-quality content, and the proliferation of misinformation. Addressing these issues, we introduce GPTZero a state-of-the-art industrial AI detection solution, offering reliable discernment between human and LLM-generated text. Our key contributions include: introducing a hierarchical, multi-task architecture enabling a flexible taxonomy of human and AI texts, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy on a variety of domains with granular predictions, and achieving superior robustness to adversarial attacks and paraphrasing via multi-tiered automated red teaming. GPTZero offers accurate and explainable detection, and educates users on its responsible use, ensuring fair and transparent assessment of text.</p></details> |  |

Sampling temperature directly controls the exploration--exploitation trade-off by modulating policy entropy, yet existing methods rely on static values or heuristic adaptations that are decoupled from task-level rewards. We propose Introspective LLM, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that learns to control sampling temperature during generation. At each decoding step, the model selects a temperature based on its hidden state and samples the next token from the resulting distribution. Temperature and token policies are jointly optimized from downstream rewards using a coordinate ascent scheme. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that learned temperature policies outperform fixed and heuristic baselines, while exhibiting interpretable exploration behaviors aligned with reasoning uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

When expanding AI access, governments face a set of strategic choices over whether to buy existing services, build domestic capabilities, or adopt hybrid approaches across different domains and use cases. These are critical decisions especially when leading model providers are often foreign corporations, and LLM outputs are increasingly treated as trusted inputs to public decision-making and public discourse. In practice, these decisions are not intended to mandate a single approach across all domains; instead, national AI strategies are typically pluralistic, with sovereign, commercial and open-source models coexisting to serve different purposes. Governments may rely on commercial models for non-sensitive or commodity tasks, while pursuing greater control for critical, high-risk or strategically important applications. This paper provides a strategic framework for making this decision by evaluating these options across dimensions including sovereignty, safety, cost, resource capability, cultural fit, and sustainability. Importantly, "building" does not imply that governments must act alone: domestic capabilities may be developed through public research institutions, universities, state-owned enterprises, joint ventures, or broader national ecosystems. By detailing the technical requirements and practical challenges of each pathway, this work aims to serve as a reference for policy-makers to determine whether a buy or build approach best aligns with their specific national needs and societal goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The short version of this document is published as an ACM TechBrief, and this document is published as an ACM Technology Policy Council white paper</p></details> |

We present Bielik Guard, a family of compact Polish language safety classifiers comprising two model variants: a 0.1B parameter model based on MMLW-RoBERTa-base and a 0.5B parameter model based on PKOBP/polish-roberta-8k. Fine-tuned on a community-annotated dataset of 6,885 Polish texts, these models classify content across five safety categories: Hate/Aggression, Vulgarities, Sexual Content, Crime, and Self-Harm. Our evaluation demonstrates that both models achieve strong performance on multiple benchmarks. The 0.5B variant offers the best overall discrimination capability with F1 scores of 0.791 (micro) and 0.785 (macro) on the test set, while the 0.1B variant demonstrates exceptional efficiency. Notably, Bielik Guard 0.1B v1.1 achieves superior precision (77.65%) and very low false positive rate (0.63%) on real user prompts, outperforming HerBERT-PL-Guard (31.55% precision, 4.70% FPR) despite identical model size. The models are publicly available and designed to provide appropriate responses rather than simple content blocking, particularly for sensitive categories like self-harm.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProbeLLM: Automating Principled Diagnosis of LLM Failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12966v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how and why large language models (LLMs) fail is becoming a central challenge as models rapidly evolve and static evaluations fall behind. While automated probing has been enabled by dynamic test generation, existing approaches often discover isolated failure cases, lack principled control over exploration, and provide limited insight into the underlying structure of model weaknesses. We propose ProbeLLM, a benchmark-agnostic automated probing framework that elevates weakness discovery from individual failures to structured failure modes. ProbeLLM formulates probing as a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search, explicitly allocating limited probing budgets between global exploration of new failure regions and local refinement of recurring error patterns. By restricting probing to verifiable test cases and leveraging tool-augmented generation and verification, ProbeLLM grounds failure discovery in reliable evidence. Discovered failures are further consolidated into interpretable failure modes via failure-aware embeddings and boundary-aware induction. Across diverse benchmarks and LLMs, ProbeLLM reveals substantially broader, cleaner, and more fine-grained failure landscapes than static benchmarks and prior automated methods, supporting a shift from case-centric evaluation toward principled weakness discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Should LLMs Be Less Specific? Selective Abstraction for Reliable Long-Form Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11908v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary "all-or-nothing" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.</p></details> |  |

We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and hyperparameter optimization.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |

We introduce a novel open-access dataset, Sociocultural Statements, constructed from natural debate statements using a multi-step methodology. The dataset is synthetically labeled to enable the quantization of sociocultural norms and beliefs that LLMs exhibit in their responses to these statements, according to the Hofstede cultural dimensions. We verify the accuracy of synthetic labels using human quality control on a representative sample. We conduct a comparative analysis between two groups of LLMs developed in different countries (U.S. and China), and use as a comparative baseline patterns observed in human measurements. Using this new dataset and the analysis above, we found that culturally-distinct LLMs reflect the values and norms of the countries in which they were developed, highlighting their inability to adapt to the sociocultural backgrounds of their users.</p></details> |  |

We study next-visit event prediction, which aims to forecast a patient's upcoming clinical events based on prior visits. We propose GRAIL, a framework that models longitudinal EHRs using structured geometric representations and structure-aware retrieval. GRAIL constructs a unified clinical graph by combining deterministic coding-system hierarchies with data-driven temporal associations across event types, embeds this graph in hyperbolic space, and summarizes each visit as a probabilistic Central Event that denoises sparse observations. At inference time, GRAIL retrieves a structured set of clinically plausible future events aligned with hierarchical and temporal progression, and optionally refines their ranking using an LLM as a constrained inference-time reranker. Experiments on MIMIC-IV show that GRAIL consistently improves multi-type next-visit prediction and yields more hierarchy-consistent forecasts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Left-right asymmetry in predicting brain activity from LLMs' representations emerges with their formal linguistic competence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12811v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When humans and large language models (LLMs) process the same text, activations in the LLMs correlate with brain activity measured, e.g., with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, it has been shown that, as the training of an LLM progresses, the performance in predicting brain activity from its internal activations improves more in the left hemisphere than in the right one. The aim of the present work is to understand which kind of competence acquired by the LLMs underlies the emergence of this left-right asymmetry. Using the OLMo-2 7B language model at various training checkpoints and fMRI data from English participants, we compare the evolution of the left-right asymmetry in brain scores alongside performance on several benchmarks. We observe that the asymmetry co-emerges with the formal linguistic abilities of the LLM. These abilities are demonstrated in two ways: by the model's capacity to assign a higher probability to an acceptable sentence than to a grammatically unacceptable one within a minimal contrasting pair, or its ability to produce well-formed text. On the opposite, the left-right asymmetry does not correlate with the performance on arithmetic or Dyck language tasks; nor with text-based tasks involving world knowledge and reasoning. We generalize these results to another family of LLMs (Pythia) and another language, namely French. Our observations indicate that the left-right asymmetry in brain predictivity matches the progress in formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic patterns).</p></details> |  |

First, we analyzed the alignment mechanism between text tokens and speech tokens in LLMs. We then proposed a metric termed the Optimal Alignment Score (OAS), which employs the Viterbi algorithm to evaluate text-speech alignment quality. Subsequently, OAS was integrated into the training of CosyVoice2 to assist LLMs in learning continuous, stable alignment. Additionally, the pre-trained attention value is employed to guide the training of the student CosyVoice2 via chain-of-thought (CoT), which further reduces stability hallucinations in synthesized speech. Experiments on the Seed-TTS-Eval and CV3-Eval test sets demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively reduce the stability hallucinations of CosyVoice2 without introducing additional negative effects.

However, text feedback they provide is often unintelligible, generic, and not specific to user criteria. Inspired by structured rubrics in education and intelligible AI explanations, we propose iRULER following identified design guidelines to \textit{scaffold} the review process by \textit{specific} criteria, providing \textit{justification} for score selection, and offering \textit{actionable} revisions to target different quality levels. To \textit{qualify} user-defined criteria, we recursively used iRULER with a rubric-of-rubrics to iteratively \textit{refine} rubrics. In controlled experiments on writing revision and rubric creation, iRULER most improved validated LLM-judged review scores and was perceived as most helpful and aligned compared to read-only rubric and text-based LLM feedback. Qualitative findings further support how iRULER satisfies the design guidelines for user-defined feedback. This work contributes interactive rubric tools for intelligible LLM-based review and revision of writing, and user-defined rubric creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear at CHI 2026</p></details> |

However, most existing multi-robot collaboration methods rely on extensive task-specific training, which limits their adaptability to new or diverse scenarios. Recent research leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enable more flexible collaboration without specialized training. Yet, current LLM-empowered approaches remain inefficient: when confronted with identical or similar tasks, they must replan from scratch because they omit task-level similarities. To address this limitation, we propose MeCo, a similarity-aware multi-robot collaboration framework that applies the principle of ``cache and reuse'' (a.k.a., memoization) to reduce redundant computation. Unlike simple task repetition, identifying and reusing solutions for similar but not identical tasks is far more challenging, particularly in multi-robot settings. To this end, MeCo introduces a new similarity testing method that retrieves previously solved tasks with high relevance, enabling effective plan reuse without re-invoking LLMs. Furthermore, we present MeCoBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate performance on similar-task collaboration scenarios. Experimental results show that MeCo substantially reduces planning costs and improves success rates compared with state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closing the Loop: A Control-Theoretic Framework for Provably Stable Time Series Forecasting with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12756v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown exceptional potential in time series forecasting, leveraging their inherent sequential reasoning capabilities to model complex temporal dynamics. However, existing approaches typically employ a naive autoregressive generation strategy. We identify a critical theoretical flaw in this paradigm: during inference, the model operates in an open-loop manner, consuming its own generated outputs recursively. This leads to inevitable error accumulation (exposure bias), where minor early deviations cascade into significant trajectory drift over long horizons. In this paper, we reformulate autoregressive forecasting through the lens of control theory, proposing \textbf{F-LLM} (Feedback-driven LLM), a novel closed-loop framework. Unlike standard methods that passively propagate errors, F-LLM actively stabilizes the trajectory via a learnable residual estimator (Observer) and a feedback controller. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our closed-loop mechanism ensures uniformly bounded error, provided the base model satisfies a local Lipschitz constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F-LLM significantly mitigates error propagation, achieving good performance on time series benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Static Question Banks: Dynamic Knowledge Expansion via LLM-Automated Graph Construction and Adaptive Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00020v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized education systems increasingly rely on structured knowledge representations to support adaptive learning and question generation. However, existing approaches face two fundamental limitations. First, constructing and maintaining knowledge graphs for educational content largely depends on manual curation, resulting in high cost and poor scalability. Second, most personalized education systems lack effective support for state-aware and systematic reasoning over learners' knowledge, and therefore rely on static question banks with limited adaptability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Generative GraphRAG framework for automated knowledge modeling and personalized exercise generation. It consists of two core modules. The first module, Automated Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Constructor (Auto-HKG), leverages LLMs to automatically construct hierarchical knowledge graphs that capture structured concepts and their semantic relations from educational resources. The second module, Cognitive GraphRAG (CG-RAG), performs graph-based reasoning over a learner mastery graph and combines it with retrieval-augmented generation to produce personalized exercises that adapt to individual learning states. The proposed framework has been deployed in real-world educational scenarios, where it receives favorable user feedback, suggesting its potential to support practical personalized education systems.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose PsyCrisis-Bench, a reference-free evaluation benchmark based on real-world Chinese mental health dialogues. It evaluates whether the model responses align with the safety principles defined by experts. Specifically designed for settings without standard references, our method adopts a prompt-based LLM-as-Judge approach that conducts in-context evaluation using expert-defined reasoning chains grounded in psychological intervention principles. We employ binary point-wise scoring across multiple safety dimensions to enhance the explainability and traceability of the evaluation. Additionally, we present a manually curated, high-quality Chinese-language dataset covering self-harm, suicidal ideation, and existential distress, derived from real-world online discourse. Experiments on 3600 judgments show that our method achieves the highest agreement with expert assessments and produces more interpretable evaluation rationales compared to existing approaches. Our dataset and evaluation tool are publicly available to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |

We extend this perspective by examining how ideological tendencies vary across topics and how consistently models maintain their positions, a property we refer to as stability. To capture this dimension, we propose PReSS (Political Response Stability under Stress), a black-box framework that evaluates LLMs by jointly considering model and topic context, categorizing responses into four stance types: stable-left, unstable-left, stable-right, and unstable-right. Applying PReSS to 12 widely used LLMs across 19 political topics reveals substantial variation in stance stability; for instance, a model that is left-leaning overall can exhibit stable-right behavior on certain topics. This highlights the importance of topic-aware and fine-grained evaluation of political ideologies of LLMs. Moreover, stability has practical implications for controlled generation and model alignment: interventions such as debiasing or ideology reversal should explicitly account for stance stability. Our empirical analyses reveal that when models are prompted or fine-tuned to adopt the opposite ideology, unstable topic stances are more likely to change, whereas stable ones resist modification. Thus, treating stability as a moderating factor provides a principled foundation for understanding, evaluating, and guiding interventions in politically sensitive model behavior.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Manually tuning these parameters for optimal performance demands considerable expertise, while traditional auto-tuning approaches struggle with the enormous search space and low sample efficiency inherent to this domain. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation and logical reasoning, offering new possibilities for system optimization. However, applying LLMs to real-time compaction tuning in such latency-sensitive environments is a double-edged sword. While large-scale LLMs can offer superior reasoning for strategy generation, their high inference latency and computational cost make them impractical for interactive, low-latency tuning. In contrast, small-scale LLMs achieve low latency but often at the expense of reasoning accuracy and tuning effectiveness. In this paper, we first evaluate this trade-off by analyzing the compaction-tuning performance and inference latency of LLMs at different scales in an LSM-tree-based tuning case. We then characterize the performance of LSM-tree on RocksDB v8.8.1, with a focus on adjusting the key compaction-related parameters under db_bench workloads. Our experimental results show a clear positive correlation between model capability and tuning effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, although frontier AI systems represented by large language models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, their capabilities in this scope are still understudied. In this paper, we introduce PoliCon, a novel benchmark constructed from 2,225 high-quality deliberation records of the European Parliament over 13 years, ranging from 2009 to 2022, to evaluate the ability of LLMs to draft consensus resolutions based on divergent party positions under varying collective decision-making contexts and political requirements. Specifically, PoliCon incorporates four factors to build each task environment for finding different political consensus: specific political issues, political goals, participating parties, and power structures based on seat distribution. We also developed an evaluation framework based on social choice theory for PoliCon, which simulates the real voting outcomes of different political parties to assess whether LLM-generated resolutions meet the requirements of the predetermined political consensus. Our experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models remain undersatisfied with complex tasks like passing resolutions by a two-thirds majority and addressing security issues, while uncovering their inherent partisan biases and revealing some behaviors LLMs show to achieve the consensus, such as prioritizing the stance of the dominant party instead of uniting smaller parties, which highlights PoliCon's promise as an effective platform for studying LLMs' ability to promote political consensus.

However, current agents typically rely on fixed cognitive patterns: non-thinking models generate immediate responses, while thinking models engage in deep reasoning uniformly. This rigidity is inefficient for long-horizon tasks, where cognitive demands vary significantly from step to step, with some requiring strategic planning and others only routine execution. In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step. Grounded in ACT-R theory, we design four hierarchical cognitive levels ranging from instinctive responses to strategic planning. Our two-stage training approach includes Cognition-aware Supervised Fine-tuning (CoSFT) to instill stable level-specific patterns, and Cognition-aware Policy Optimization (CoPO) for step-level credit assignment via confidence-aware advantage reweighting. The key insight is that appropriate cognitive depth should maximize the confidence of the resulting action. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld demonstrate that CogRouter achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency. With Qwen2.5-7B, it reaches an 82.3% success rate, outperforming GPT-4o (+40.3%), OpenAI-o3 (+18.3%), and GRPO (+14.0%), while using 62% fewer tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Agents for Inventory Control: Human-LLM-OR Complementarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12631v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inventory control is a fundamental operations problem in which ordering decisions are traditionally guided by theoretically grounded operations research (OR) algorithms. However, such algorithms often rely on rigid modeling assumptions and can perform poorly when demand distributions shift or relevant contextual information is unavailable. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have generated interest in AI agents that can reason flexibly and incorporate rich contextual signals, but it remains unclear how best to incorporate LLM-based methods into traditional decision-making pipelines. We study how OR algorithms, LLMs, and humans can interact and complement each other in a multi-period inventory control setting. We construct InventoryBench, a benchmark of over 1,000 inventory instances spanning both synthetic and real-world demand data, designed to stress-test decision rules under demand shifts, seasonality, and uncertain lead times. Through this benchmark, we find that OR-augmented LLM methods outperform either method in isolation, suggesting that these methods are complementary rather than substitutes. We further investigate the role of humans through a controlled classroom experiment that embeds LLM recommendations into a human-in-the-loop decision pipeline. Contrary to prior findings that human-AI collaboration can degrade performance, we show that, on average, human-AI teams achieve higher profits than either humans or AI agents operating alone. Beyond this population-level finding, we formalize an individual-level complementarity effect and derive a distribution-free lower bound on the fraction of individuals who benefit from AI collaboration; empirically, we find this fraction to be substantial.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) have shown promise in mitigating class imbalance with numeric interpolation; however, existing approaches largely rely on embedding-space arithmetic, which fails to capture the rich semantics inherent in text-attributed graphs. In this work, we propose our method, SaVe-TAG (Semantic-aware Vicinal Risk Minimization for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs), a novel VRM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform text-level interpolation, generating on-manifold, boundary-enriching synthetic samples for minority classes. To mitigate the risk of noisy generation, we introduce a confidence-based edge assignment mechanism that uses graph topology as a natural filter to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical justification for our method and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that our approach consistently outperforms both numeric interpolation and prior long-tailed node classification baselines. Our results highlight the importance of integrating semantic and structural signals for balanced and effective learning on text-attributed graphs.

While recent LLM-driven code evolution frameworks shift fixed search space target to open-ended program spaces, they primarily rely on scalar metrics (e.g., NDCG, Hit Ratio) that fail to provide qualitative insights into model failures or directional guidance for improvement. To address this, we propose Self-EvolveRec, a novel framework that establishes a directional feedback loop by integrating a User Simulator for qualitative critiques and a Model Diagnosis Tool for quantitative internal verification. Furthermore, we introduce a Diagnosis Tool - Model Co-Evolution strategy to ensure that evaluation criteria dynamically adapt as the recommendation architecture evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Self-EvolveRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art NAS and LLM-driven code evolution baselines in both recommendation performance and user satisfaction. Our code is available at https://github.com/Sein-Kim/self_evolverec.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a novel simulation framework using large language model (LLM) agents in structured multi-round dialogs. Each agent's dialog history is iteratively updated with its own previously stated opinions and those of others analogous to the classical DeGroot model. Furthermore, by retaining each agent's initial opinion throughout the dialog, we simulate anchoring effects consistent with the Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion dynamics. Our framework thus bridges classical opinion dynamics models and modern multi-agent LLM systems, providing a scalable tool for simulating and analyzing opinion formation when real-world data is limited or inaccessible.</p></details> |  |

While recent works have introduced Large Language Model (LLM) based agents for Linux kernel crash-resolution, their evaluation benchmarks are usually static and thus, do not capture the evolving nature of the Linux kernel, and suffer from potential data contamination due to LLM knowledge cutoffs. To address the above problem, we present (i) Live-kBench, an evaluation framework for self-evolving benchmarks that continuously scrapes and evaluates agents on freshly discovered kernel bugs, and (ii) kEnv, an agent-agnostic standardized crash-resolution environment for kernel compilation, execution, and feedback. This design decouples agent workflows from heavy-weight execution, enabling fair and scalable comparison across diverse agent frameworks under identical conditions. To this end, we curate an inaugural dataset of 534 Linux kernel bugs and empirically demonstrate a significant performance gap, with agents achieving up to 25% higher equivalent patch rate on bugs fixed before the LLM knowledge cutoff. Using kEnv, we benchmark three state-of-the-art agents, showing that they resolve 74% of crashes on the first attempt (plausible patches); however only ~20% of generated patches closely match developer fixes. Additionally, exposing crash resolution feedback improves crash resolution rate by 29%. Live-kBench provides the community with an evaluation infrastructure for self-evolving benchmarks that is both time and attribute sensitive; complete with a public dashboard to track agent progress on Linux kernel bugs.</p></details> |  |

Using the IFMIF-DONES fusion energy project as a case study, we implemented a five-stage data collection pipeline across 81 region-language combinations, yielding 1,482 validated records after a 56% noise reduction. Results are compared against two licensed press databases: MyNews (2,280 records) and ProQuest Newsstream Collection (148 records). Overlap analysis reveals high complementarity, with 76% of Google News records exclusive to this platform. The dataset captures content types absent from proprietary databases, including specialized outlets, institutional communications, and social media posts. However, significant methodological challenges emerge: temporal instability requiring synchronic collection, a 100-result cap per query demanding multi-stage strategies, and unexpected noise including academic PDFs, false positives, and pornographic content infiltrating results through black hat SEO techniques. LLM-assisted extraction proved effective for structured articles but exhibited systematic hallucination patterns requiring validation protocols. We conclude that Google News offers valuable complementary coverage for communication research but demands substantial methodological investment, multi-source triangulation, and robust filtering mechanisms to ensure dataset integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Communication Methods and Measures</p></details> |

We introduce mpLLM, a multimodal LLM for visual question answering (VQA) on mpMRI that produces clinically interpretable tumor descriptors (e.g., volume, morphology, extent, and coarse localization) as an adjunct to clinical expertise for referring neurosurgeons. mpLLM uses a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts (MoE) to fuse multiple 3D sequences via routing over modality- and token-level projection experts, enabling data-efficient end-to-end training without large-scale image-report pretraining. To address limited paired image-text supervision, we propose a synthetic VQA protocol that derives clinically grounded questions and answers from expert segmentation annotations and is validated with radiologist collaboration. Across multiple mpMRI datasets, mpLLM improves over strong medical VLM baselines by +5.5 points on average (+9.1% relative) and increases radiologist-rated clinical acceptability by +15.9 points (+46.6% relative). Our study features three main contributions: (1) the first VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a hierarchical MoE architecture for joint reasoning over interrelated 3D sequences, and (3) expert-supported evidence of clinical utility. Source code is available at https://github.com/arvindmvepa/mpllm, and we will release the dataset upon publication.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |

We propose ATLAS (Adaptive Task-distributed Learning for Agentic Self-evolution), a task-distributed framework that iteratively develops a lightweight research agent while delegating complementary roles to specialized supporter agents for exploration, hyperparameter tuning, and reference policy management. Our core algorithm, Evolving Direct Preference Optimization (EvoDPO), adaptively updates the phase-indexed reference policy. We provide a theoretical regret analysis for a preference-based contextual bandit under concept drift. In addition, experiments were conducted on non-stationary linear contextual bandits and scientific machine learning (SciML) loss reweighting for the 1D Burgers' equation. Both results show that ATLAS improves stability and performance over a static single-agent baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Modeling of Therapist-Client Dynamics in Psychotherapy Using LLM-Based Assessments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12450v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Psychotherapy is a primary treatment for many mental health conditions, yet the interplay among therapist behaviors, client responses, and the therapeutic relationship remains difficult to untangle. This work advances a computational approach for modeling these moment-to-moment processes. We first developed automated methods using large language models (LLMs) to assess therapist behaviors (e.g., empathy, exploration), relational qualities (e.g., rapport), and client outcomes (e.g., disclosure, self-directed and outward-directed negative emotions). These measures showed strong alignment with human ratings (mean Pearson $r = .66$). We then analyzed nearly 2,000 hours of psychotherapy transcripts from the Alexander Street corpus using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). SEM showed that therapist empathy and exploration directly shaped client disclosure and emotional expression, whereas rapport may contribute to reductions in internal emotional distress rather than increased willingness to express it. Together, these findings demonstrate how computational tools can capture core therapeutic processes at scale and offer new opportunities for understanding, modeling, and improving therapist training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Principled Synthetic Data Enables the First Scaling Laws for LLMs in Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07298v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a promising frontier for recommender systems, yet their development has been impeded by the absence of predictable scaling laws, which are crucial for guiding research and optimizing resource allocation. We hypothesize that this may be attributed to the inherent noise, bias, and incompleteness of raw user interaction data in prior continual pre-training (CPT) efforts. This paper introduces a novel, layered framework for generating high-quality synthetic data that circumvents such issues by creating a curated, pedagogical curriculum for the LLM. We provide powerful, direct evidence for the utility of our curriculum by showing that standard sequential models trained on our principled synthetic data significantly outperform ($+130\%$ on recall@100 for SasRec) models trained on real data in downstream ranking tasks, demonstrating its superiority for learning generalizable user preference patterns. Building on this, we empirically demonstrate, for the first time, robust power-law scaling for an LLM that is continually pre-trained on our high-quality, recommendation-specific data. Our experiments reveal consistent and predictable perplexity reduction across multiple synthetic data modalities. These findings establish a foundational methodology for reliable scaling LLM capabilities in the recommendation domain, thereby shifting the research focus from mitigating data deficiencies to leveraging high-quality, structured information.</p></details> | <details><summary>added...</summary><p>added more results on scaling law analysis</p></details> |

We present KeySense, a purely software solution that preserves physical keyboard motor skills. KeySense isolates intentional taps from resting-finger noise using cognitive-motor timing patterns, and then uses a fine-tuned LLM decoder to convert the resulting noisy letter sequence into the intended word. In controlled component tests, the decoder substantially outperforms two statistical baselines (top-1 accuracy 84.8% vs 75.7% and 79.3%). A 12-participant study shows clear ergonomic and performance benefits: compared with the conventional hover-style keyboard, users rated KeySense as markedly less physically demanding (NASA-TLX median 1.5 vs 4.0), and after brief practice typed significantly faster (WPM 28.3 vs 26.2, p < 0.01). These results indicate that KeySense enables accurate, efficient, and comfortable ten-finger text entry on commodity touchscreens without any extra hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figures.

| **[Stabilizing Native Low-Rank LLM Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12429v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved remarkable success, yet their growing parameter counts pose significant computational and memory challenges. Low-rank factorization offers a promising route to reduce training and inference costs, but the community lacks a stable recipe for training models from scratch using exclusively low-rank weights while matching the performance of the dense model. We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be trained from scratch using exclusively low-rank factorized weights for all non-embedding matrices without auxiliary "full-rank" guidance required by prior methods. While native low-rank training often suffers from instability and loss spikes, we identify uncontrolled growth in the spectral norm (largest singular value) of the weight matrix update as the dominant factor. To address this, we introduce Spectron: Spectral renormalization with orthogonalization, which dynamically bounds the resultant weight updates based on the current spectral norms of the factors. Our method enables stable, end-to-end factorized training with negligible overhead. Finally, we establish compute-optimal scaling laws for natively low-rank transformers, demonstrating predictable power-law behavior and improved inference efficiency relative to dense models.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, existing benchmarks fail to differentiate question difficulty, limiting their ability to effectively distinguish models' capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose RankLLM, a novel framework designed to quantify both question difficulty and model competency. RankLLM introduces difficulty as the primary criterion for differentiation, enabling a more fine-grained evaluation of LLM capabilities. RankLLM's core mechanism facilitates bidirectional score propagation between models and questions. The core intuition of RankLLM is that a model earns a competency score when it correctly answers a question, while a question's difficulty score increases when it challenges a model. Using this framework, we evaluate 30 models on 35,550 questions across multiple domains. RankLLM achieves 90% agreement with human judgments and consistently outperforms strong baselines such as IRT. It also exhibits strong stability, fast convergence, and high computational efficiency, making it a practical solution for large-scale, difficulty-aware LLM evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 9 figures.

A single score conflates multiple quality dimensions, prevents flexible filtering, and offers no interpretability. We introduce propella-1, a family of small multilingual LLMs (0.6B, 1.7B, 4B parameters) that annotate text documents across 18 properties organized into six categories: core content, classification, quality and value, audience and purpose, safety and compliance, and geographic relevance. The models support 57 languages and produce structured JSON annotations conforming to a predefined schema. Evaluated against a frontier commercial LLM as a reference annotator, the 4B model achieves higher agreement than much larger general-purpose models. We release propella-annotations, a dataset of over three billion document annotations covering major pretraining corpora including data from FineWeb-2, FinePDFs, HPLT 3.0, and Nemotron-CC. Using these annotations, we present a multi-dimensional compositional analysis of widely used pretraining datasets, revealing substantial differences in quality, reasoning depth, and content composition that single-score approaches cannot capture. All model weights and annotations are released under permissive, commercial-use licenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Relea...</summary><p>Release: https://hf.co/collections/ellamind/propella-1</p></details> |

Many existing approaches to constructing post-training data quantify diversity using text-based metrics that capture linguistic variation, but such metrics provide only weak signals for the task-relevant features that determine downstream performance. In this work, we introduce Feature Activation Coverage (FAC) which measures data diversity in an interpretable feature space. Building upon this metric, we further propose a diversity-driven data synthesis framework, named FAC Synthesis, that first uses a sparse autoencoder to identify missing features from a seed dataset, and then generates synthetic samples that explicitly reflect these features. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves both data diversity and downstream performance on various tasks, including instruction following, toxicity detection, reward modeling, and behavior steering. Interestingly, we identify a shared, interpretable feature space across model families (i.e., LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen), enabling cross-model knowledge transfer. Our work provides a solid and practical methodology for exploring data-centric optimization of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, LLM agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, without assuming that the attacker can directly modify the memory bank of the agent. The attacker injects malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps corresponding to a different target query during the agent's execution of the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link victim queries to the malicious reasoning steps. During the memory injection, we propose an indication prompt that guides the agent to autonomously generate similar bridging steps, with a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing later victim queries. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting the risk.</p></details> | Code released |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating LLM Reasoning Beyond Correctness and CoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18134v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What does it truly mean for a language model to "reason"? Current evaluations reward models' correct standalone answers-but correctness alone reveals little about the process that produced them. We argue that reasoning should be understood not as a static chain of steps but as a dynamic trajectory in which ideas interact, clash, and evolve into integrated insights. Building on the philosophical tradition of dialectics, we introduce SIEV, a structured evaluation framework that assesses reasoning through explicit thesis-antithesis-synthesis interactions. SIEV produces interpretable trajectories that highlight key properties of reasoning-robustness to challenge, adaptability under conflict, and synthesis across competing viewpoints-dimensions that conventional correctness-based metrics cannot capture. Empirical results on GSM and MMLU demonstrate substantial gaps in the reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art models: for example, GPT-5-chat loses more than 40 points (out of 100) on GSM when evaluated through SIEV's process-oriented lens. By shifting focus from what answer a model gives to how it arrives there, SIEV enables a more transparent and principled distinction between structured reasoning and surface-level pattern generation offering a clearer foundation for assessing and understanding the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this gap, our study examines the benefits and limitations of using LLMs as real-time learning support, considering how classroom constraints, such as diverse proficiency levels and limited time, affect their effectiveness. We conducted a deployment study with 157 eighth-grade students in a South Korean middle school English class over six weeks. Our findings reveal that while scaffolding improved students' ability to compose grammatically correct sentences, this step-by-step approach demotivated lower-proficiency students and increased their system reliance. We also observed challenges to classroom dynamics, where extroverted students often dominated the teacher's attention, and the system's assistance made it difficult for teachers to identify struggling students. Based on these findings, we discuss design guidelines for integrating LLMs into real-time writing classes as inclusive educational tools.</p></details> | Under Review |

This strategy is computationally efficient but the underlying constraint can be overly rigid for heterogeneous projection weights and may incur avoidable accuracy loss. We propose CoSpaDi (Compression via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a training-free framework that replaces low-rank factorization with a structured sparse decomposition in which each weight matrix is represented as a dense dictionary multiplied by a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This yields a union-of-subspaces model: the columns of the weight matrix are represented as linear combinations of different subsets of dictionary atoms, improving expressiveness at a fixed parameter budget. CoSpaDi is calibration-guided: using a small calibration set, we optimize the factorization to minimize functional reconstruction error of layer outputs rather than weight-space error. An activation-derived Gram orthonormalization reformulates this data-aware objective into a standard dictionary learning problem on transformed weights, and we support both per-layer compression and cross-layer dictionary sharing within groups of similar projections. Across Llama and Qwen model families, CoSpaDi consistently improves the accuracy--compression and perplexity--compression trade-offs over state-of-the-art SVD-based baselines and strong structured pruning baselines at 20-40\% compression ratios. The resulting structured sparsity enables sparse--dense computation and integrates with post-training quantization of the sparse coefficients.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) now assist in experiment design and procedural guidance, yet their "illusion of understanding" may lead researchers to overtrust unsafe outputs. Here we show that current models remain far from meeting the reliability needed for safe laboratory operation. We introduce LabSafety Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates models on hazard identification, risk assessment, and consequence prediction across 765 multiple-choice questions and 404 realistic lab scenarios, encompassing 3,128 open-ended tasks. Evaluations on 19 advanced LLMs and VLMs show that no model evaluated on hazard identification surpasses 70% accuracy. While proprietary models perform well on structured assessments, they do not show a clear advantage in open-ended reasoning. These results underscore the urgent need for specialized safety evaluation frameworks before deploying AI systems in real laboratory settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

Prior work primarily focuses on manipulating tool names and descriptions to increase the likelihood of installation by users and selection by LLM agents. However, a successful attack also requires embedding malicious behaviors in the tool's code implementation, which remains largely unexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first systematic study of malicious tool code implementations. We first propose a taxonomy of malicious tool behaviors based on the confidentiality-integrity-availability triad, tailored to LLM-agent settings. To investigate the severity of the risks posed by attackers exploiting coding LLMs to automatically generate malicious tools, we develop MalTool, a coding-LLM-based framework that synthesizes tools exhibiting specified malicious behaviors, either as standalone tools or embedded within otherwise benign implementations. To ensure functional correctness and structural diversity, MalTool leverages an automated verifier that validates whether generated tools exhibit the intended malicious behaviors and differ sufficiently from prior instances, iteratively refining generations until success. Our evaluation demonstrates that MalTool is highly effective even when coding LLMs are safety-aligned. Using MalTool, we construct two datasets of malicious tools: 1,200 standalone malicious tools and 5,287 real-world tools with embedded malicious behaviors. We further show that existing detection methods, including commercial malware detection approaches such as VirusTotal and methods tailored to the LLM-agent setting, exhibit limited effectiveness at detecting the malicious tools, highlighting an urgent need for new defenses.</p></details> |  |

However, in scientific reasoning tasks, these models remain fragile due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies. In this work, we propose Sci-CoE, a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables models to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning. In the first stage, the model uses a small set of annotated data to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier. In the second stage, we introduce a geometric reward mechanism that jointly considers consensus, reliability, and diversity, driving large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data. Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate that Sci-CoE enhances complex reasoning capabilities and exhibits strong scalability, facilitating the construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

Spatially, workloads comprise heterogeneous requests with varying compute and memory demands. Temporally, workload composition varies over time. Nevertheless, existing systems typically assume spatially uniform and temporally stable workloads, employing a homogeneous, static model deployment. This mismatch between the assumption and real-world spatial-temporal heterogeneity results in suboptimal performance. We present OServe, an LLM serving system with heterogeneous and flexible model deployment that addresses both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. First, OServe introduces a novel workload-aware scheduling algorithm that optimizes heterogeneous model deployments according to real-time workload characteristics. Second, OServe proposes an efficient workload-adaptive switching method that migrates model deployments in response to predicted workload changes. Experiments on real-world traces show that OServe improves performance by up to 2$\times$ (average: 1.5$\times$) compared to state-of-the-art serving systems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the Value Alignment Tax (VAT), a framework that measures how alignment-induced changes propagate across interconnected values relative to achieved on-target gain. VAT captures the dynamics of value expression under alignment pressure. Using a controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory, we collect paired pre-post normative judgments and analyze alignment effects across models, values, and alignment strategies. Our results show that alignment often produces uneven, structured co-movement among values. These effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation, revealing systemic, process-level alignment risks and offering new insights into the dynamics of value alignment in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, most evaluations of LLM timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2026, Datasets & Benchmarks Track</p></details> |

Task and motion planning (TAMP) addresses this by grounding symbolic plans in low-level execution, yet it relies heavily on manually engineered planning domains. To improve long-horizon planning reliability and reduce human intervention, we present Planning Domain Derivation with LLMs (PDDLLM), a framework that automatically induces symbolic predicates and actions directly from demonstration trajectories by combining LLM reasoning with physical simulation roll-outs. Unlike prior domain-inference methods that rely on partially predefined or language descriptions of planning domains, PDDLLM constructs domains without manual domain initialization and automatically integrates them with motion planners to produce executable plans, enhancing long-horizon planning automation. Across 1,200 tasks in nine environments, PDDLLM outperforms six LLM-based planning baselines, achieving at least 20\% higher success rates, reduced token costs, and successful deployment on multiple physical robot platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn, multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce MARSHAL, an end-to-end RL framework that incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning through Self-play witH strAtegic LLMs in both cooperative and competitive games. MARSHAL features a turn-level advantage estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and competitive games, MARSHAL agents trained from Qwen3-4B develop strong strategic abilities, with up to 28.7% performance improvements in held-out games. More importantly, the capability acquired through self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of MASs in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading MASs, our MARSHAL agent achieves significant zero-shot performance gains of up to 10.0% on AIME, 7.6% on GPQA-Diamond, and 3.5% on average across all benchmarks. These results establish self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvoGPT: Leveraging LLM-Driven Seed Diversity to Improve Search-Based Test Suite Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12424v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) is a well-established approach for automated unit test generation, yet it often suffers from premature convergence and limited diversity in the generated test suites. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative technique for unit test generation. We present EvoGPT, a hybrid test generation system that integrates LLM-based test generation with SBST-based test suite optimization. EvoGPT uses LLMs to generate an initial population of test suites, and uses an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to further optimize this test suite population. A distinguishing feature of EvoGPT is its explicit enforcement of diversity, achieved through the use of multiple temperatures and prompt instructions during test generation. In addition, each LLM-generated test is refined using a generation-repair loop and coverage-guided assertion generation. To address evolutionary plateaus, EvoGPT also detects stagnation during search and injects additional LLM-generated tests aimed at previously uncovered branches. Here too diversity is enforced using multiple temperatures and prompt instructions. We evaluate EvoGPT on Defects4J, a standard benchmark for test generation. The results show that EvoGPT achieves, on average, a 10% improvement in both code coverage and mutation score metrics compared to TestART, an LLM-only baseline; and EvoSuite, a standard SBST baseline. An ablation study indicates that explicitly enforcing diversity both at initialization and during the search is key to effectively leveraging LLMs for automated unit test generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving HPC Code Generation Capability of LLMs via Online Reinforcement Learning with Real-Machine Benchmark Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12049v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong code generation capabilities, yet the runtime performance of generated code is not guaranteed, and there have been few attempts to train LLMs using runtime performance as a reward in the HPC domain. We propose an online reinforcement learning approach that executes LLM-generated code on a supercomputer and directly feeds back the measured runtime performance (GFLOPS) as a reward. We further introduce a Staged Quality-Diversity (SQD) algorithm that progressively varies the permitted optimization techniques on a per-problem basis, enabling the model to learn code optimization from diverse perspectives. We build a distributed system connecting a GPU training cluster with a CPU benchmarking cluster, and train Qwen2.5 Coder 14B on a double-precision matrix multiplication task using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through two experiments, we show that reinforcement learning combining runtime performance feedback with staged optimization can improve the HPC code generation capability of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[PrefillShare: A Shared Prefill Module for KV Reuse in Multi-LLM Disaggregated Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12029v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems increasingly orchestrate multiple specialized language models to solve complex real-world problems, often invoking them over a shared context. This execution pattern repeatedly processes the same prompt prefix across models. Consequently, each model redundantly executes the prefill stage and maintains its own key-value (KV) cache, increasing aggregate prefill load and worsening tail latency by intensifying prefill-decode interference in existing LLM serving stacks. Disaggregated serving reduces such interference by placing prefill and decode on separate GPUs, but disaggregation does not fundamentally eliminate inter-model redundancy in computation and KV storage for the same prompt. To address this issue, we propose PrefillShare, a novel algorithm that enables sharing the prefill stage across multiple models in a disaggregated setting. PrefillShare factorizes the model into prefill and decode modules, freezes the prefill module, and fine-tunes only the decode module. This design allows multiple task-specific models to share a prefill module and the KV cache generated for the same prompt. We further introduce a routing mechanism that enables effective prefill sharing across heterogeneous models in a vLLM-based disaggregated system. PrefillShare not only matches full fine-tuning accuracy on a broad range of tasks and models, but also delivers 4.5x lower p95 latency and 3.9x higher throughput in multi-model agent workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 13 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

VibeCodeHPC adopts Claude Code as its backend and provides an integrated environment that facilitates program development in supercomputer settings. The system not only brings the Vibe Coding paradigm -- program development through natural language interaction with users -- to HPC programming, but also enables autonomous performance optimization with minimal user intervention through a sophisticated multi-agent design. To achieve these objectives, VibeCodeHPC implements three core functionalities: (1) configuration capabilities tailored to the unique development environments of supercomputers, (2) collaborative operation among multiple LLM agents with distinct roles -- Project Manager (PM), System Engineer (SE), Programmer (PG), and Continuous Deliverer (CD), and (3) long-term autonomous operation through agent activity monitoring and dynamic deployment mechanisms. This paper highlights one of the most powerful features of VibeCodeHPC: fully automated code optimization through autonomous operation without user intervention. Specifically, it demonstrates the performance optimization of CPU-based codes on GPU-equipped systems for matrix multiplication and a Poisson equation solver using Jacobi's iterative method. The results show that the multi-agent configuration employed in VibeCodeHPC enables faster and more reliable development of higher-performance code compared to a single-agent setup.</p></details> |  |

While efforts have been made to combine these methods, they primarily rely on post-selection or predefined strategies, leaving an open question: whether LLMs can autonomously adapt their reasoning strategy based on their inherent capabilities. In this work, we propose TATA (Teaching LLMs According to Their Aptitude), an adaptive framework that enables LLMs to personalize their reasoning strategy spontaneously, aligning it with their intrinsic aptitude. TATA incorporates base-LLM-aware data selection during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to tailor training data to the model's unique abilities. This approach equips LLMs to autonomously determine and apply the appropriate reasoning strategy at test time. We evaluate TATA through extensive experiments on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using both general-purpose and math-specialized LLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that TATA effectively combines the complementary strengths of CoT and TIR, achieving superior or comparable performance with improved inference efficiency compared to TIR alone. Further analysis underscores the critical role of aptitude-aware data selection in enabling LLMs to make effective and adaptive reasoning decisions and align reasoning strategies with model capabilities.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Detecting harmful content at early stages is essential for understanding and potentially mitigating its downstream spread. In this study, we introduce USE24-XD, a large-scale dataset of nearly 100k posts collected from X (formerly Twitter) during the 2024 U.S. presidential election cycle, enriched with spatio-temporal metadata. To substantially reduce the cost of manual annotation while enabling scalable categorization, we employ six large language models (LLMs) to systematically annotate posts across five nuanced categories: Conspiracy, Sensationalism, Hate Speech, Speculation, and Satire. We validate LLM annotations with crowdsourcing (n = 34) and benchmark them against human annotators. Inter-rater reliability analyses show comparable agreement patterns between LLMs and humans, with LLMs exhibiting higher internal consistency and achieving up to 0.90 recall on Speculation. We apply a wisdom-of-the-crowd approach across LLMs to aggregate annotations and curate a robust multi-label dataset. 60% of posts receive at least one label. We further analyze how human annotator demographics, including political ideology and affiliation, shape labeling behavior, highlighting systematic sources of subjectivity in judgments of harmful content. The USE24-XD dataset is publicly released to support future research.</p></details> |  |

A Student-Teacher Dual-Head LLMs Architecture for Pharmaceutical Content Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11957v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to create content in regulated domains such as pharmaceuticals, where outputs must be scientifically accurate and legally compliant. Manual quality control (QC) is slow, error prone, and can become a publication bottleneck. We introduce LRBTC, a modular LLM and vision language model (VLM) driven QC architecture covering Language, Regulatory, Brand, Technical, and Content Structure checks. LRBTC combines a Student-Teacher dual model architecture, human in the loop (HITL) workflow with waterfall rule filtering to enable scalable, verifiable content validation and optimization. On AIReg-Bench, our approach achieves 83.0% F1 and 97.5% recall, reducing missed violations by 5x compared with Gemini 2.5 Pro. On CSpelling, it improves mean accuracy by 26.7%. Error analysis further reveals that while current models are strong at detecting misspellings (92.5 recall), they fail to identify complex medical grammatical (25.0 recall) and punctuation (41.7 recall) errors, highlighting a key area for future work. This work provides a practical, plug and play solution for reliable, transparent quality control of content in high stakes, compliance critical industries.

Archetypes of Roles Assigned to LLMs During Human-AI Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11924v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly supporting decision-making across high-stakes domains, requiring critical reflection on the socio-technical factors that shape how humans and LLMs are assigned roles and interact during human-in-the-loop decision-making. This paper introduces the concept of human-LLM archetypes -- defined as re-curring socio-technical interaction patterns that structure the roles of humans and LLMs in collaborative decision-making. We describe 17 human-LLM archetypes derived from a scoping literature review and thematic analysis of 113 LLM-supported decision-making papers. Then, we evaluate these diverse archetypes across real-world clinical diagnostic cases to examine the potential effects of adopting distinct human-LLM archetypes on LLM outputs and decision outcomes. Finally, we present relevant tradeoffs and design choices across human-LLM archetypes, including decision control, social hierarchies, cognitive forcing strategies, and information requirements. Through our analysis, we show that selection of human-LLM interaction archetype can influence LLM outputs and decisions, bringing important risks and considerations for the designers of human-AI decision-making systems</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM CHI 2026</p></details> |

When grammars evolve, textual instances that originally conformed to them may become outdated. While model-driven engineering provides many techniques for co-evolving models with metamodel changes, these approaches are not designed for textual DSLs and may lose human-relevant information such as layout and comments. This study systematically evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs) for co-evolving grammars and instances of textual DSLs. Using Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5.2 across ten case languages with ten runs each, we assess both correctness and preservation of human-oriented information. Results show strong performance on small-scale cases ($\geq$94% precision and recall for instances requiring fewer than 20 modified lines), but performance degraded with scale: Claude maintains 85% recall at 40 lines, while GPT fails on the largest instances. Response time increases substantially with instance size, and grammar evolution complexity and deletion granularity affect performance more than change type. These findings clarify when LLM-based co-evolution is effective and where current limitations remain.</p></details> |  |

Yet our analyses reveal that apparent convergence in benchmark accuracy can conceal deep epistemic divergence. Using two major reasoning benchmarks - MMLU-Pro and GPQA - we show that LLMs achieving comparable accuracy still disagree on 16-66% of items, and 16-38% among top-performing frontier models. These discrepancies suggest distinct error profiles for different LLMs. When such models are used for scientific data annotation and inference, their hidden disagreements propagate into research results: in re-analyses of published studies in education and political science, switching the annotation model can change estimated treatment effects by more than 80%, and in some cases reverses their sign. Together, these findings illustrate a benchmark illusion, where equal accuracy may conceal disagreement, with model choice becoming a hidden yet consequential variable for scientific reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

We first demonstrate that strong LLMs, without additional training, exhibit generalization capabilities to leverage the code sandbox for non-code tasks. For example, LLMs spontaneously access external resources to acquire new knowledge, leverage the file system to handle long contexts, and execute scripts to satisfy formatting requirements. We further show that these agentic capabilities can be enhanced through LLM-in-Sandbox Reinforcement Learning (LLM-in-Sandbox-RL), which uses only non-agentic data to train models for sandbox exploration. Experiments demonstrate that LLM-in-Sandbox, in both training-free and post-trained settings, achieves robust generalization spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biomedicine, long-context understanding, and instruction following. Finally, we analyze LLM-in-Sandbox's efficiency from computational and system perspectives, and open-source it as a Python package to facilitate real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://llm-in-sandbox.github.io</p></details> |

We present a semi-automated pipeline for Subject-Predicate-Object triplet extraction that uses ontology-driven proxy metrics, specifically Ontology Conformance and Faithfulness, instead of ground-truth-based evaluation. We compare a static, manually engineered ontology against a fully automated, document-specific ontology induction approach across different LLMs and two corporate annual reports. The automatically induced ontology achieves 100% schema conformance in all configurations, eliminating the ontology drift observed with the manual approach. We also propose a hybrid verification strategy that combines regex matching with an LLM-as-a-judge check, reducing apparent subject hallucination rates from 65.2% to 1.6% by filtering false positives caused by coreference resolution. Finally, we identify a systematic asymmetry between subject and object hallucinations, which we attribute to passive constructions and omitted agents in financial prose.</p></details> |  |

Despite growing interest in LLM safety, existing taxonomies and evaluation frameworks remain largely general-purpose and fail to capture the domain-specific risks inherent to real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce DriveSafe, a hierarchical, four-level risk taxonomy designed to systematically characterize safety-critical failure modes of LLM-based driving assistants. The taxonomy comprises 129 fine-grained atomic risk categories spanning technical, legal, societal, and ethical dimensions, grounded in real-world driving regulations and safety principles and reviewed by domain experts. To validate the safety relevance and realism of the constructed prompts, we evaluate their refusal behavior across six widely deployed LLMs. Our analysis shows that the evaluated models often fail to appropriately refuse unsafe or non-compliant driving-related queries, underscoring the limitations of general-purpose safety alignment in driving contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The authors are withdrawing this manuscript due to substantial revisions currently underway.

To address the above challenges, this paper presents EasyUUV, a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced, universal, and lightweight simulation-to-reality reinforcement learning (RL) framework for robust attitude control of UUVs. EasyUUV combines parallelized RL training with a hybrid control architecture, where a learned policy outputs high-level attitude corrections executed by an adaptive S-Surface controller. A multimodal LLM is further integrated to adaptively tune controller parameters at runtime using visual and textual feedback, enabling training-free adaptation to unmodeled dynamics. Also, we have developed a low-cost 6-DoF UUV platform and applied an RL policy trained through efficient parallelized simulation. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and outstanding performance of EasyUUV in achieving robust and adaptive UUV attitude control across diverse underwater conditions.

Unlike prior work that relies on output probabilities or external embeddings, we utilize internal hidden states that capture model uncertainty before answer generation. We introduce ProbeDirichlet, a lightweight router that aggregates cross-layer hidden states via learnable Dirichlet distributions with probabilistic training. Trained on multi-domain data, it generalizes robustly across in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Existing methods rely on auxiliary models for static length prediction, but they incur high overhead, generalize poorly, and fail in stochastic "one-to-many" sampling scenarios. We introduce a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Our framework features two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP), which uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost, and 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP), which dynamically estimates the remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. To validate our approach, we build and release ForeLen, a comprehensive benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. On ForeLen, EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16\% over the best baseline. Integrating our methods with a length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains. Our work provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference.</p></details> |  |

To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>For m...</summary><p>For more information, visit the project website: https://robitsg.github.io/LASEV/</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating LLM Safety Under Repeated Inference via Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11786v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess safety risk through breadth-oriented evaluation across diverse tasks. However, real-world deployment exposes a different class of risk: operational failures arising from repeated inference on identical or near-identical prompts rather than broad task generalization. In high-stakes settings, response consistency and safety under sustained use are critical. We introduce Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing (APST), a depth-oriented evaluation framework inspired by reliability engineering. APST repeatedly samples identical prompts under controlled operational conditions (e.g., decoding temperature) to surface latent failure modes including hallucinations, refusal inconsistency, and unsafe completions. Rather than treating failures as isolated events, APST models them as stochastic outcomes of independent inference events. We formalize safety failures using Bernoulli and binomial models to estimate per-inference failure probabilities, enabling quantitative comparison of reliability across models and decoding configurations. Applying APST to multiple instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on AIR-BENCH-derived safety prompts, we find that models with similar benchmark-aligned scores can exhibit substantially different empirical failure rates under repeated sampling, particularly as temperature increases. These results demonstrate that shallow, single-sample evaluation can obscure meaningful reliability differences under sustained use. APST complements existing benchmarks by providing a practical framework for evaluating LLM safety and reliability under repeated inference, bridging benchmark alignment and deployment-oriented risk assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 9 figures.

We model workflows as sequences of tool use and reformulate the problem as designing a mechanism that can both solve tasks and reliably construct workflows. Prior approaches that build workflows during execution often suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between the two processes. We propose an Execute-Summarize(ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness. We introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.</p></details> |  |

This paper offers a comparative analysis of AI-related regulatory and ethical frameworks across key global regions, including the European Union, United Kingdom, United States, China, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. It maps how core trustworthiness principles, such as transparency, fairness, accountability, data privacy, and human oversight are embedded in regional legislation and AI governance structures. Special emphasis is placed on the evolving landscape in the GCC, where countries are rapidly advancing national AI strategies and education-sector innovation. To support this development, the paper introduces a Compliance-Centered AI Governance Framework tailored to the GCC context. This includes a tiered typology and institutional checklist designed to help regulators, educators, and developers align AI adoption with both international norms and local values. By synthesizing global best practices with region-specific challenges, the paper contributes practical guidance for building legally sound, ethically grounded, and culturally sensitive AI systems in education. These insights are intended to inform future regulatory harmonization and promote responsible AI integration across diverse educational environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

High temperatures encourage diverse but noisy outputs, while low temperatures produce focused outputs but may cause premature convergence. Yet static or heuristic temperature schedules fail to adapt to the dynamic demands of reinforcement learning (RL) throughout training, often limiting policy improvement. We propose Temperature Adaptive Meta Policy Optimization (TAMPO), a new framework that recasts temperature control as a learnable meta-policy. TAMPO operates through a hierarchical two-loop process. In the inner loop, the LLM policy is updated (e.g., using GRPO) with trajectories sampled at the temperature selected by the meta-policy. In the outer loop, meta-policy updates the distribution over candidate temperatures by rewarding those that maximize the likelihood of high-advantage trajectories. This trajectory-guided, reward-driven mechanism enables online adaptation without additional rollouts, directly aligning exploration with policy improvement. On five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, TAMPO outperforms baselines using fixed or heuristic temperatures, establishing temperature as an effective learnable meta-policy for adaptive exploration in LLM reinforcement learning.

| **[Provably Convergent Primal-Dual DPO for Constrained LLM Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05703v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread application of large language models (LLMs) raises increasing demands on ensuring safety or imposing constraints, such as reducing harmful content and adhering to predefined rules. While there have been several works studying LLM safety alignment, these works either need to train three models and incur high memory costs, or require prior knowledge on the optimal solution. Witnessing this fact, we investigate the constrained alignment problem for LLMs, i.e., maximizing the reward of outputs while restricting the cost to stay below a threshold. We propose a novel primal-dual direct preference optimization (DPO) approach, which first trains a model using standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward information to fine-tune LLMs. Our approach only needs to train two models rather than three, which significantly saves memory costs, and does not require extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous suboptimality and constraint violation guarantees. We also extend our approach to enable online exploration and drop the data coverage dependence in the results. Experiments on the PKU-SafeRLHF and TruthfulQA datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSR: Trajectory-Search Rollouts for Multi-Turn RL of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11767v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in large language models (LLMs) are driving a shift toward using reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents from iterative, multi-turn interactions across tasks. However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing communication protocols either rely on natural language, incurring high inference costs and information loss, or on hidden states, which suffer from information concentration bias and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose KVComm, a novel communication framework that enables efficient communication between LLMs through selective sharing of KV pairs. KVComm leverages the rich information encoded in the KV pairs while avoiding the pitfalls of hidden states. We introduce a KV layer-wise selection strategy based on attention importance scores with a Gaussian prior to identify the most informative KV pairs for communication. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and model pairs demonstrate that KVComm achieves comparable performance to the upper-bound method, which directly merges inputs to one model without any communication, while transmitting as few as 30\% of layers' KV pairs. Our study highlights the potential of KV pairs as an effective medium for inter-LLM communication, paving the way for scalable and efficient multi-agent systems.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

While coding LLMs have advanced static 3D scene generation, extending this paradigm to 4D dynamics remains a critical frontier. This task presents two fundamental challenges: multi-scale context entanglement, where monolithic generation fails to balance local object structures with global environmental layouts; and a semantic-physical execution gap, where open-loop code generation leads to physical hallucinations lacking dynamic fidelity. We introduce Code2Worlds, a framework that formulates 4D generation as language-to-simulation code generation. First, we propose a dual-stream architecture that disentangles retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration. Second, to ensure dynamic fidelity, we establish a physics-aware closed-loop mechanism in which a PostProcess Agent scripts dynamics, coupled with a VLM-Motion Critic that performs self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code. Evaluations on the Code4D benchmark show Code2Worlds outperforms baselines with a 41% SGS gain and 49% higher Richness, while uniquely generating physics-aware dynamics absent in prior static methods.

| **[Cooperation Breakdown in LLM Agents Under Communication Delays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11754v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS), in which autonomous AI agents cooperate to solve tasks, are gaining increasing attention. For such systems to be deployed in society, agents must be able to establish cooperation and coordination under real-world computational and communication constraints. We propose the FLCOA framework (Five Layers for Cooperation/Coordination among Autonomous Agents) to conceptualize how cooperation and coordination emerge in groups of autonomous agents, and highlight that the influence of lower-layer factors - especially computational and communication resources - has been largely overlooked. To examine the effect of communication delay, we introduce a Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma with Communication Delay and conduct simulations with LLM-based agents. As delay increases, agents begin to exploit slower responses even without explicit instructions. Interestingly, excessive delay reduces cycles of exploitation, yielding a U-shaped relationship between delay magnitude and mutual cooperation. These results suggest that fostering cooperation requires attention not only to high-level institutional design but also to lower-layer factors such as communication delay and resource allocation, pointing to new directions for MAS research.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks often focus on isolated details, failing to reflect the complexity of professional analysis that requires synthesizing information across multiple documents, reporting periods, and corporate entities. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not disentangle whether errors arise from retrieval failures, generation inaccuracies, domain-specific reasoning mistakes, or misinterpretation of the query or context, making it difficult to precisely diagnose performance bottlenecks. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Fin-RATE, a benchmark built on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and mirroring financial analyst workflows through three pathways: detail-oriented reasoning within individual disclosures, cross-entity comparison under shared topics, and longitudinal tracking of the same firm across reporting periods. We benchmark 17 leading LLMs, spanning open-source, closed-source, and finance-specialized models, under both ground-truth context and retrieval-augmented settings. Results show substantial performance degradation, with accuracy dropping by 18.60\% and 14.35\% as tasks shift from single-document reasoning to longitudinal and cross-entity analysis. This degradation is driven by increased comparison hallucinations, temporal and entity mismatches, and is further reflected in declines in reasoning quality and factual consistency--limitations that existing benchmarks have yet to formally categorize or quantify.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Architecture Model Diffing with Crosscoders: Unsupervised Discovery of Differences Between LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11729v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model diffing, the process of comparing models' internal representations to identify their differences, is a promising approach for uncovering safety-critical behaviors in new models. However, its application has so far been primarily focused on comparing a base model with its finetune. Since new LLM releases are often novel architectures, cross-architecture methods are essential to make model diffing widely applicable. Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons. We provide the first application of crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model. Using this technique, we find in an unsupervised fashion features including Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B. Together, our results work towards establishing cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing as an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Driven 3D Scene Generation of Agricultural Simulation Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11706v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Procedural generation techniques in 3D rendering engines have revolutionized the creation of complex environments, reducing reliance on manual design. Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. These limitations lead to reduced control and poor scalability. This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision. Future work will explore expanding the asset hierarchy, incorporating real-time generation, and adapting the pipeline to other simulation domains beyond agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2026</p></details> |

While existing multi-region load balancers save prefill computation by prioritizing Key--Value (KV) Cache hit rate, they ignore cluster networking latency, a critical factor in routing decisions. We introduce GORGO, a method for minimizing TTFT by optimizing a total serving cost as a function of available compute, network latency, and prefix caching. Using extensive profiling on custom infrastructure, we analyze component-level latency bottlenecks and benchmark GORGO against three baselines: (1) naive least-load routing, which ignores prefix-cache overlap; (2) prefix-similarity routing, which selectively pushes requests to the replica with the highest cached-prefix overlap; and (3) a centralized HTTP proxy that runs the GORGO policy while tracking requests across all nodes. We demonstrate that GORGO reduces P99 TTFT through network-aware routing and improves average TTFT by preventing pathological cross-region forwarding. Additionally, we find that GORGO-proxy overcomes synchronization overhead in previous methods and is 2.5x faster on median TTFT, demonstrating the success of a centralized router.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures.

We introduce a general-purpose framework that trains explanation-generating LLMs via reinforcement learning from AI feedback, with distributional rewards generated by generative continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). CNFs capture the pluralistic and probabilistic nature of human judgments about explanations. Moreover, under mild assumptions, CNFs provably bound deviations from true human reward distributions when trained on noisy proxy rewards from LLMs. We design a specialized CNF architecture that selectively attends to linguistic cues in the decision context and explanations when generating rewards. Human and LLM evaluators find that our method delivers explanations that enable more accurate predictions of true agent decisions, exhibit greater logical soundness and actionability, and impose lower cognitive load than explanations trained with proxy LLM rewards or state-of-the-art RLHF and RLAIF baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, effectively integrating these capabilities with collaborative signals while avoiding prohibitive inference latency remains a critical bottleneck. To address this, we propose a trajectory-driven internalization framework to develop a Single-agent Trajectory-Aligned Recommender (STAR). Specifically, to internalize complex reasoning capabilities into a single efficient model, we first design a multi-agent teacher system capable of multi-turn tool usage and reflection. This teacher utilizes a Collaborative Signal Translation mechanism to explicitly convert latent behavioral patterns into descriptive natural language evidence to enhance reasoning accuracy. Subsequently, a trajectory-driven distillation pipeline transfers this agentic logic, including planning, tool usage, and self-reflection, into the compact STAR model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAR surpasses its teacher by 8.7% to 39.5% while eliminating iterative latency, paving the way for real-time, reasoning-enhanced recommendation.</p></details> |  |

Two complementary approaches have emerged to address these issues: token-adaptive layer execution, which reduces floating-point operations (FLOPs) by selectively bypassing layers, and quantization, which lowers memory footprint by reducing weight precision. However, naively integrating these techniques leads to additional accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models. We propose QTALE (Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs), a novel framework that enables seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization while preserving accuracy. Conventional token-adaptive methods reduce redundancy in two ways: (1) by limiting the diversity of training paths explored during fine-tuning, and (2) by lowering the number of parameters actively involved in inference. To overcome these limitations, QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy that ensures diverse execution paths are actively explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism that allows flexible adjustment of the execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed. Experimental results show that QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks. By combining token-adaptive execution for FLOPs reduction and quantization for memory savings, QTALE provides an effective solution for efficient LLM deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We show this pathology has a precise causal origin: autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish association P(Y|X) from intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure we formalize as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

Score inflation and selective reporting have eroded the authority of standard benchmarks, leaving the community uncertain about which evaluation results remain trustworthy. We introduce the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a pure data-driven framework for auditing evaluation sets along three orthogonal and complementary axes: (1) Capability Discrimination, measuring how sharply a benchmark separates model performance beyond noise; (2) Anti-Saturation, estimating remaining headroom before ceiling effects erode resolution and thus the benchmark's expected longevity; and (3) Impact, quantifying influence across academic and industrial ecosystems via adoption breadth and practice-shaping power. By distilling 106 validated benchmarks from the technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025, we systematically characterize the evaluation landscape. BHI is the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, providing a principled basis for benchmark selection and enabling dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables.

We present SteerMoE, a framework to steer MoE models by detecting and controlling behavior-associated experts. We detect key experts by comparing how often they activate between paired inputs that demonstrate opposite behaviors (e.g., safe vs. unsafe). By selectively activating or deactivating such experts during inference, we control behaviors like faithfulness and safety without fine-tuning. Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, our steering raises safety by up to +20% and faithfulness by +27%. Alternatively, unsafe steering drops safety by -41% alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods, bypassing all safety guardrails. Overall, SteerMoE offers a lightweight, effective, and widely applicable test-time control, while revealing unique vulnerabilities in MoE LLMs. https://github.com/adobe-research/SteerMoE</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens. To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in recognizing complex patterns, yet their deployment on edge devices remains impractical due to their resource demands. However, in edge malware detection, static or centrally retrained models degrade under evolving threats and heterogeneous traffic; locally trained models become siloed and fail to transfer across domains. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we present a continuous learning architecture for edge-based malware detection that combines local adaptation on each device with global knowledge sharing through parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Lightweight transformer models (DistilBERT, DistilGPT-2, TinyT5) run on edge nodes and are incrementally fine-tuned on device-specific traffic; only the resulting LoRA modules are aggregated by a lightweight coordinator and redistributed, enabling cross-device generalization without exchanging raw data. We evaluate on two public IoT security datasets, Edge-IIoTset and TON-IoT, under multi-round learning to simulate evolving threats. Compared to isolated fine-tuning, the LoRA-based exchange yields up to 20-25% accuracy gains when models encounter previously unseen attacks from another domain, while maintaining stable loss and F1 across rounds. LoRA adds less than 1% to model size (~0.6-1.8 MB), making updates practical for constrained edge hardware.</p></details> |  |

However, the intensive computational and memory demands pose significant challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, split federated learning (SFL) emerges as a promising solution that partitions the model into lightweight client-side and compute-intensive server-side sub-models, thus offloading the primary training workload to a powerful server. Nevertheless, high-dimensional activation exchanges in SFL lead to excessive communication overhead. To overcome this, we propose SplitCom, a communication-efficient SFL framework for LLMs that exploits temporal redundancy in activations across consecutive training epochs. Inspired by video compression, the core innovation of our framework lies in selective activation uploading only when a noticeable deviation from previous epochs occurs. To balance communication efficiency and learning performance, we introduce two adaptive threshold control schemes based on 1) bang-bang control or 2) deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning. Moreover, we implement dimensionality reduction techniques to alleviate client-side memory requirements. Furthermore, we extend SplitCom to the U-shape architecture, ensuring the server never accesses clients' labels. Extensive simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrate that SplitCom reduces uplink communication costs by up to 98.6\,\% in its standard configuration and total communication costs by up to 95.8\,\% in its U-shape variant without noticeably compromising model performance.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains unclear how specific feedback elements, such as tone and information coverage, contribute to learning outcomes and learner acceptance, particularly across learners with different personality traits. In this study, we define six feedback elements and generate feedback for multiple-choice biology questions using GPT-5. We conduct a learning experiment with 321 first-year high school students and evaluate feedback effectiveness using two learning outcomes measures and subjective evaluations across six criteria. We further analyze differences in how feedback acceptance varies across learners based on Big Five personality traits. Our results show that effective feedback elements share common patterns supporting learning outcomes, while learners' subjective preferences differ across personality-based clusters. These findings highlight the importance of selecting and adapting feedback elements according to learners' personality traits when we design LLM-generated feedback, and provide practical implications for personalized feedback design in education.</p></details> | Under Review |

While effective on in-distribution (ID) data, GNNs often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes with unseen textual or structural patterns in real-world settings, leading to overconfident and erroneous predictions in the absence of reliable OOD detection. Early approaches address this issue from a topology-driven perspective, leveraging neighboring structures to mitigate node-level detection bias. However, these methods typically encode node texts as shallow vector features, failing to fully exploit rich semantic information. In contrast, recent LLM-based approaches generate pseudo OOD priors by leveraging textual knowledge, but they suffer from several limitations: (1) a reliability-informativeness imbalance in the synthesized OOD priors, as the generated OOD exposures either deviate from the true OOD semantics, or introduce non-negligible ID noise, all of which offers limited improvement to detection performance; (2) reliance on specialized architectures, which prevents incorporation of the extensive effective topology-level insights that have been empirically validated in prior work. To this end, we propose LG-Plug, an LLM-Guided Plug-and-play strategy for TAG OOD detection tasks. LG-Plug aligns topology and text representations to produce fine-grained node embeddings, then generates consensus-driven OOD exposure via clustered iterative LLM prompting. Moreover, it leverages lightweight in-cluster codebook and heuristic sampling reduce time cost of LLM querying. The resulting OOD exposure serves as a regularization term to separate ID and OOD nodes, enabling seamless integration with existing detectors.</p></details> | Under Review |

Sanity Checking Self-Preference Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22548v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) favor their own outputs when acting as judges, undermining the integrity of automated post-training and evaluation workflows. However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of "easy" versus "hard" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions. More widely, this work contributes to the growing body of work on cataloging and isolating judge-bias effects.</p></details> |  |

We find the answer is often no. In a study of 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA, we observe that ReAct-style agents produce 2.0--4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average, even with identical inputs. More importantly, this variance predicts failure: tasks with consistent behavior ($\leq$2 unique paths) achieve 80--92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks ($\geq$6 unique paths) achieve only 25--60%, a 32--55 percentage point gap depending on model. We trace variance to early decisions: 69% of divergence occurs at step 2, the first search query. Our results suggest that monitoring behavioral consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static workflows, fixed roles, and limited inter-agent communication, reducing their effectiveness in open-ended, high-complexity domains. This paper proposes a coordination framework that enables adaptiveness through three core mechanisms: dynamic task routing, bidirectional feedback, and parallel agent evaluation. The framework allows agents to reallocate tasks based on confidence and workload, exchange structured critiques to iteratively improve outputs, and crucially compete on high-ambiguity subtasks with evaluator-driven selection of the most suitable result. We instantiate these principles in a modular architecture and demonstrate substantial improvements in factual coverage, coherence, and efficiency over static and partially adaptive baselines. Our findings highlight the benefits of incorporating both adaptiveness and structured competition in multi-agent LLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 Workshop on WoMAPF, Camera ready version</p></details> |

| **[Learning to Approximate Uniform Facility Location via Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13155v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in using neural networks, especially message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems heuristically. However, existing learning-based approaches for hard combinatorial optimization tasks often rely on supervised training data, reinforcement learning, or gradient estimators, leading to significant computational overhead, unstable training, or a lack of provable performance guarantees. In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location (UniFL), a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design. We develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles while avoiding the need for solver supervision or discrete relaxations. Our approach admits provable approximation and size generalization guarantees to much larger instances than seen during training. Empirically, we show that our approach outperforms standard non-learned approximation algorithms in terms of solution quality, closing the gap with computationally intensive integer linear programming approaches. Overall, this work provides a step toward bridging learning-based methods and approximation algorithms for discrete optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlashSchNet: Fast and Accurate Coarse-Grained Neural Network Molecular Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13140v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network (GNN) potentials such as SchNet improve the accuracy and transferability of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation by learning many-body interactions, but remain slower than classical force fields due to fragmented kernels and memory-bound pipelines that underutilize GPUs. We show that a missing principle is making GNN-MD IO-aware, carefully accounting for reads and writes between GPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. We present FlashSchNet, an efficient and accurate IO-aware SchNet-style GNN-MD framework built on four techniques: (1) flash radial basis, which fuses pairwise distance computation, Gaussian basis expansion, and cosine envelope into a single tiled pass, computing each distance once and reusing it across all basis functions; (2) flash message passing, which fuses cutoff, neighbor gather, filter multiplication, and reduction to avoid materializing edge tensors in HBM; (3) flash aggregation, which reformulates scatter-add via CSR segment reduce, reducing atomic writes by a factor of feature dimension and enabling contention-free accumulation in both forward and backward passes; (4) channel-wise 16-bit quantization that exploits the low per-channel dynamic range in SchNet MLP weights to further improve throughput with negligible accuracy loss. On a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000, FlashSchNet achieves 1000 ns/day aggregate simulation throughput over 64 parallel replicas on coarse-grained (CG) protein containing 269 beads (6.5x faster than CGSchNet baseline with 80% reduction of peak memory), surpassing classical force fields (e.g. MARTINI) while retaining SchNet-level accuracy and transferability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/flash-molecular-dynamics</p></details> |
| **[Which Algorithms Can Graph Neural Networks Learn?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13106v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding neural architectures' ability to learn to execute discrete algorithms, a line of work often referred to as neural algorithmic reasoning. The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) have shown promise in mitigating class imbalance with numeric interpolation; however, existing approaches largely rely on embedding-space arithmetic, which fails to capture the rich semantics inherent in text-attributed graphs. In this work, we propose our method, SaVe-TAG (Semantic-aware Vicinal Risk Minimization for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs), a novel VRM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform text-level interpolation, generating on-manifold, boundary-enriching synthetic samples for minority classes. To mitigate the risk of noisy generation, we introduce a confidence-based edge assignment mechanism that uses graph topology as a natural filter to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical justification for our method and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that our approach consistently outperforms both numeric interpolation and prior long-tailed node classification baselines. Our results highlight the importance of integrating semantic and structural signals for balanced and effective learning on text-attributed graphs.

However, existing TGNNs primarily target one-time predictions for a given temporal span, whereas many practical applications require continuous predictions, that predictions are issued frequently over time. Directly adapting existing TGNNs to continuous-prediction scenarios introduces either significant computational overhead or prediction quality issues especially for large graphs. This paper revisits the challenge of { continuous predictions} in TGNNs, and introduces {\sc Coden}, a TGNN model designed for efficient and effective learning on dynamic graphs. {\sc Coden} innovatively overcomes the key complexity bottleneck in existing TGNNs while preserving comparable predictive accuracy. Moreover, we further provide theoretical analyses that substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of {\sc Coden}, and clarify its duality relationship with both RNN-based and attention-based models. Our evaluations across five dynamic datasets show that {\sc Coden} surpasses existing performance benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness, establishing it as a superior solution for continuous prediction in evolving graph environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal driven Attention Graph Neural Network with Block Adjacency matrix (STAG-NN-BA) for Remote Land-use Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14322v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Land-use monitoring is fundamental for spatial planning, particularly in view of compound impacts of growing global populations and climate change. Despite existing applications of deep learning in land use monitoring, standard convolutional kernels in deep neural networks limit the applications of these networks to the Euclidean domain only. Considering the geodesic nature of the measurement of the earth's surface, remote sensing is one such area that can benefit from non-Euclidean and spherical domains. For this purpose, we designed a novel Graph Neural Network architecture for spatial and spatio-temporal classification using satellite imagery to acquire insights into socio-economic indicators. We propose a hybrid attention method to learn the relative importance of irregular neighbors in remote sensing data. Instead of classifying each pixel, we propose a method based on Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) image segmentation and Graph Attention Network. The superpixels obtained from SLIC become the nodes of our Graph Convolution Network (GCN). A region adjacency graph (RAG) is then constructed where each superpixel is connected to every other adjacent superpixel in the image, enabling information to propagate globally. Finally, we propose a Spatially driven Attention Graph Neural Network (SAG-NN) to classify each RAG. We also propose an extension to our SAG-NN for spatio-temporal data. Unlike regular grids of pixels in images, superpixels are irregular in nature and cannot be used to create spatio-temporal graphs. We introduce temporal bias by combining unconnected RAGs from each image into one supergraph. This is achieved by introducing block adjacency matrices resulting in novel Spatio-Temporal driven Attention Graph Neural Network with Block Adjacency matrix (STAG-NN-BA). SAG-NN and STAG-NN-BA outperform graph and non-graph baselines on Asia14 and C2D2 datasets efficiently.</p></details> |  |

Despite its importance, finding the most frequent induced subgraph remains computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the subgraph counting task. Traditional exact enumeration algorithms often suffer from high time complexity, especially for a large graph size $k$. To mitigate this, existing approaches often utilize frequency measurement with the Downward Closure Property to reduce the search space, imposing additional constraints on the task. In this paper, we first formulate this task as a Markov Decision Process and approach it using a multi-task reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we introduce RLMiner, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with our proposed task-state-aware Graph Neural Network to find the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ with a time complexity linear to $k$. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed RLMiner effectively identifies subgraphs with frequencies closely matching the ground-truth most frequent induced subgraphs, while achieving significantly shorter and more stable running times compared to traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

We show that these wavelets may be effectively incorporated into a family of geometric graph neural networks, which we refer to as VDW-GNNs. We demonstrate that such networks are effective on synthetic point cloud data, as well as on real-world data derived from wind-field measurements and neural activity data. Theoretically, we prove that these new wavelets have desirable frame theoretic properties, similar to traditional diffusion wavelets. Additionally, we prove that these wavelets have desirable symmetries with respect to rotations and translations.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A previous, shorter version of this work was presented in the workshop "New Perspectives in Advancing Graph Machine Learning" at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[ATLAS: Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14908v5)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on homophilic graphs where connected nodes share labels, but struggle with heterophilic graphs where edges do not imply similarity. Moreover, iterative message passing limits scalability due to neighborhood expansion overhead. We introduce ATLAS (Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale), a propagation-free framework that encodes graph structure through multi-resolution community features rather than message passing. We first prove that community refinement involves a fundamental trade-off: finer partitions increase label-community mutual information but also increase entropy. We formalize when refinement improves normalized mutual information, explaining why intermediate granularities are often most predictive. ATLAS employs modularity-guided adaptive search to automatically identify informative community scales, which are one-hot encoded, projected into learnable embeddings, and concatenated with node attributes for MLP classification. This enables standard mini-batch training and adjacency-free inference after one-time preprocessing. Across 13 benchmarks including million-node graphs, ATLAS achieves competitive or superior accuracy, up to 20-point gains over GCN on heterophilic datasets and 12-point gains over MLPs on homophilic graphs. By treating topology as explicit features, ATLAS adapts intelligently: leveraging structure when informative, remaining robust when weakly aligned, and avoiding propagation when structure misleads, providing both scalable performance and interpretable structural insights.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Bayesian Neighborhood Adaptation for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05358v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The neighborhood scope (i.e., number of hops) where graph neural networks (GNNs) aggregate information to characterize a node's statistical property is critical to GNNs' performance. Two-stage approaches, training and validating GNNs for every pre-specified neighborhood scope to search for the best setting, is a time-consuming task and tends to be biased due to the search space design. How to adaptively determine proper neighborhood scopes for the aggregation process for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs remains largely unexplored. We thus propose to model the GNNs' message-passing behavior on a graph as a stochastic process by treating the number of hops as a beta process. This Bayesian framework allows us to infer the most plausible neighborhood scope for message aggregation simultaneously with the optimization of GNN parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that the scope inference improves the expressivity of a GNN. Experiments on benchmark homophilic and heterophilic datasets show that the proposed method is compatible with state-of-the-art GNN variants, achieving competitive or superior performance on the node classification task, and providing well-calibrated predictions.

Such representations are beneficial in the unsupervised learning of clusters and community detection. Nonetheless, such inference may reveal sensitive groups, clustered systems, or collective behaviors, raising concerns regarding group-level privacy. Community attribution in social and critical infrastructure networks, for example, can expose coordinated asset groups, operational hierarchies, and system dependencies that could be used for profiling or intelligence gathering. We study a defensive setting in which a data publisher (defender) seeks to conceal a community of interest while making limited, utility-aware changes in the network. Our analysis indicates that community concealment is strongly influenced by two quantifiable factors: connectivity at the community boundary and feature similarity between the protected community and adjacent communities. Informed by these findings, we present a perturbation strategy that rewires a set of selected edges and modifies node features to reduce the distinctiveness leveraged by GNN message passing. The proposed method outperforms DICE in our experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real network graphs under identical perturbation budgets. Overall, it achieves median relative concealment improvements of approximately 20-45% across the evaluated settings. These findings demonstrate a mitigation strategy against GNN-based community learning and highlight group-level privacy risks intrinsic to graph learning.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces RokomariBG, a large-scale, multi-entity heterogeneous book graph dataset designed to support research on personalized recommendation in a low-resource language setting. The dataset comprises 127,302 books, 63,723 users, 16,601 authors, 1,515 categories, 2,757 publishers, and 209,602 reviews, connected through eight relation types and organized as a comprehensive knowledge graph. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we provide a systematic benchmarking study on the Top-N recommendation task, evaluating a diverse set of representative recommendation models, including classical collaborative filtering methods, matrix factorization models, content-based approaches, graph neural networks, a hybrid matrix factorization model with side information, and a neural two-tower retrieval architecture. The benchmarking results highlight the importance of leveraging multi-relational structure and textual side information, with neural retrieval models achieving the strongest performance (NDCG@10 = 0.204). Overall, this work establishes a foundational benchmark and a publicly available resource for Bangla book recommendation research, enabling reproducible evaluation and future studies on recommendation in low-resource cultural domains.

| **[Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13062v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over graph-structured data, yet recent studies have shown that their performance gains are beginning to plateau. In many cases, well-established models such as GCN and GAT, when appropriately tuned, can match or even exceed the performance of more complex, state-of-the-art architectures. This trend highlights a key limitation in the current landscape: the difficulty of selecting the most suitable model for a given graph task or dataset. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models (SAGMM), a modular and practical framework that learns to automatically select and combine the most appropriate GNN models from a diverse pool of architectures. Unlike prior mixture-of-experts approaches that rely on variations of a single base model, SAGMM leverages architectural diversity and a topology-aware attention gating mechanism to adaptively assign experts to each node based on the structure of the input graph. To improve efficiency, SAGMM includes a pruning mechanism that reduces the number of active experts during training and inference without compromising performance. We also explore a training-efficient variant in which expert models are pretrained and frozen, and only the gating and task-specific layers are trained. We evaluate SAGMM on 16 benchmark datasets covering node classification, graph classification, regression, and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms or matches leading GNN baselines and prior mixture-based methods, offering a robust and adaptive solution for real-world graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Recently, the focus of GPL has shifted from in-domain to cross-domain scenarios, which is closer to the real world applications, where the pre-training source and downstream target often differ substantially in data distribution. However, why GPLs remain effective under such domain shifts is still unexplored. Empirically, we observe that representative GPL methods are competitive with two simple baselines in cross-domain settings: full fine-tuning (FT) and linear probing (LP), motivating us to explore a deeper understanding of the prompting mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that jointly leveraging these two complementary branches yields a smaller estimation error than using either branch alone, formally proving that cross-domain GPL benefits from the integration between pre-trained knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose GP2F, a dual-branch GPL method that explicitly instantiates the two extremes: (1) a frozen branch that retains pre-trained knowledge, and (2) an adapted branch with lightweight adapters for task-specific adaptation. We then perform adaptive fusion under topology constraints via a contrastive loss and a topology-consistent loss. Extensive experiments on cross-domain few-shot node and graph classification demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

However, such data are inherently heterogeneous, high-dimensional, and exhibit complex intra- and inter-modality dependencies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework for modeling these structures, but existing approaches often rely on prior knowledge or predefined similarity networks that produce undirected or unweighted graphs and fail to capture task-specific directionality and interaction strength. Interpretability at both the modality and feature levels also remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose TF-DWGNet, a novel Graph Neural Network framework that combines tree-based Directed Weighted graph construction with Tensor Fusion for multiclass cancer subtype classification. TF-DWGNet introduces two key innovations: (i) a supervised tree-based strategy that constructs directed, weighted graphs tailored to each omics modality, and (ii) a tensor fusion mechanism that captures unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal interactions using low-rank decomposition for computational efficiency. Experiments on three real-world cancer datasets demonstrate that TF-DWGNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics and statistical tests. In addition, the model provides biologically meaningful insights through modality-level contribution scores and ranked feature importance. These results highlight that TF-DWGNet is an effective and interpretable solution for multi-omics integration in cancer research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Current methods fail to achieve this balance: neural architectural search is computationally expensive, while model retrieval often yields suboptimal static checkpoints. To resolve this dilemma, we model the performance gains induced by fine-grained architectural modifications as edit-effect evidence and build evidence graphs from prior tasks. By constructing a retrieval-augmented model refinement framework, our proposed M-DESIGN dynamically weaves historical evidence to discover near-optimal modification paths. M-DESIGN features an adaptive retrieval mechanism that quickly calibrates the evolving transferability of edit-effect evidence from different sources. To handle out-of-distribution shifts, we introduce predictive task planners that extrapolate gains from multi-hop evidence, thereby reducing reliance on an exhaustive repository. Based on our model knowledge base of 67,760 graph neural networks across 22 datasets, extensive experiments demonstrate that M-DESIGN consistently outperforms baselines, achieving the search-space best performance in 26 out of 33 cases under a strict budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title changed from "Beyond Model Base Selection: Weaving Knowledge to Master Fine-grained Neural Network Design" to "Beyond Model Base Retrieval: Weaving Knowledge to Master Fine-grained Neural Network Design"</p></details> |

However, the high dimensionality of multi-omics data, the heterogeneity across modalities, and the lack of reliable biological interaction networks make meaningful integration challenging. In addition, many existing models rely on handcrafted similarity graphs, are vulnerable to class imbalance, and often lack built-in interpretability, limiting their usefulness in biomedical applications. We propose Multi-Omics integration with Tree-generated Graph Neural Network (MOTGNN), a novel and interpretable framework for binary disease classification. MOTGNN employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for omics-specific supervised graph construction, followed by modality-specific Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical representation learning, and a deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration. Across three real-world disease datasets, MOTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5-10% in accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and remains robust to severe class imbalance. The model maintains computational efficiency through the use of sparse graphs and provides built-in interpretability, revealing both top-ranked biomarkers and the relative contributions of each omics modality. These results highlight the potential of MOTGNN to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability in multi-omics disease modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, LLMs, despite their general reasoning power, struggle significantly in specialized, data-sensitive tasks such as designing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This difficulty arises from (1) the inherent knowledge gaps in modeling the intricate, varying relationships between graph properties and suitable architectures and (2) the external noise from misleading descriptive inputs, often resulting in generic or even misleading model suggestions. Achieving proficiency in designing data-aware models -- defined as the meta-level capability to systematically accumulate, interpret, and apply data-specific design knowledge -- remains challenging for existing automated approaches, due to their inefficient construction and application of meta-knowledge. To achieve meta-level proficiency, we propose DesiGNN, a knowledge-centered framework that systematically converts past model design experience into structured, fine-grained knowledge priors well-suited for meta-learning with LLMs. To account for the inherent variability and external noise, DesiGNN aligns empirical property filtering from extensive benchmarks with adaptive elicitation of literature insights via LLMs. By constructing a solid meta-knowledge between unseen graph understanding and known effective architecture patterns, DesiGNN can deliver top-5.77% initial model proposals for unseen datasets within seconds and achieve consistently superior performance with minimal search cost compared to baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WSDM 2026.

While multimodal content offers a promising solution, existing methods result in suboptimal representations for new items due to noise and entanglement in sparse data. To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios. Our work validates that discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Main Track)</p></details> |
| **[RiemannGL: Riemannian Geometry Changes Graph Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10982v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are ubiquitous, and learning on graphs has become a cornerstone in artificial intelligence and data mining communities. Unlike pixel grids in images or sequential structures in language, graphs exhibit a typical non-Euclidean structure with complex interactions among the objects. This paper argues that Riemannian geometry provides a principled and necessary foundation for graph representation learning, and that Riemannian graph learning should be viewed as a unifying paradigm rather than a collection of isolated techniques. While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning. This paper aims to provide a coherent viewpoint and to stimulate broader exploration of Riemannian geometry as a foundational framework for future graph learning research.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 11 figures, position paper</p></details> |

We introduce the Intersecting Block Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges, we show how to efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense, by a dense IBG. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity lemma, showing that for any chosen accuracy, every graph, regardless of its size or sparsity, can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on the accuracy. This dependence of the rank solely on the accuracy, and not on the sparsity level, is in contrast to previous forms of the weak regularity lemma. We present a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion, while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes rather than edges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exponential time differencing for matrix-valued dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13761v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix evolution equations occur in many applications, such as dynamical Lyapunov/Sylvester systems or Riccati equations in optimization and stochastic control, machine learning or data assimilation. In many such problems, the dominant stability restriction is imposed by a stiff linear term, making standard explicit integrators impractical. Exponential time differencing (ETD) is known to produce highly stable numerical schemes by treating the linear term in an exact fashion. In particular, for stiff problems, ETD methods are the methods of choice. We extend ETD to matrix-valued evolution equations of the form $\dot Q = LQ + QR + N(Q,t)$ by deriving explicit matrix-ETD (METD) schemes. When $L$ and $R$ commute, we construct an explicit $p$-th order METD$p$ family and prove order-$p$ global convergence under standard assumptions; for the non-commuting case, we develop a Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH)-based extension. This allows us to produce highly efficient and stable integration schemes. We demonstrate efficiency and applicability on stiff PDE-derived and large-scale matrix dynamics, including an Allen-Cahn system, turbulent jet fluctuation statistics, and continuous graph neural networks. We further show that the scheme is more accurate, stable, and efficient than competing schemes in large-scale high-rank stiff systems.</p></details> |  |

Using techniques from Network Science and Machine Learning, including Erdős-Rényi for model sparsification, we enhance the efficiency of GNNs for real-world applications. We demonstrate our approach on N-1 contingency assessment in electrical grids, a critical task for ensuring grid reliability. We apply our methods to three datasets of varying sizes, exploring Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) with different degrees of sparsification and rewiring. Comparison across sparsification levels shows the potential of combining insights from both research fields to improve GNN performance and scalability. Our experiments highlight the importance of tuning sparsity parameters: while sparsity can improve generalization, excessive sparsity may hinder learning of complex patterns. Our adaptive rewiring approach, particularly when combined with early stopping, proves promising by allowing the model to adapt its connectivity structure during training. This research contributes to understanding how sparsity can be effectively leveraged in GNNs for critical applications like power grid reliability analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>75 pa...</summary><p>75 pages, 10 figures, closest to version to be published in NeurIPS</p></details> |
| **[Boundary-Aware Multi-Behavior Dynamic Graph Transformer for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10493v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the landscape of contemporary recommender systems, user-item interactions are inherently dynamic and sequential, often characterized by various behaviors. Prior research has explored the modeling of user preferences through sequential interactions and the user-item interaction graph, utilizing advanced techniques such as graph neural networks and transformer-based architectures. However, these methods typically fall short in simultaneously accounting for the dynamic nature of graph topologies and the sequential pattern of interactions in user preference models. Moreover, they often fail to adequately capture the multiple user behavior boundaries during model optimization. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a boundary-aware Multi-Behavioral Dynamic Graph Transformer (MB-DGT) model that dynamically refines the graph structure to reflect the evolving patterns of user behaviors and interactions. Our model involves a transformer-based dynamic graph aggregator for user preference modeling, which assimilates the changing graph structure and the sequence of user behaviors. This integration yields a more comprehensive and dynamic representation of user preferences. For model optimization, we implement a user-specific multi-behavior loss function that delineates the interest boundaries among different behaviors, thereby enriching the personalized learning of user preferences. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets indicate that our model consistently delivers remarkable recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dense Neural Networks are not Universal Approximators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07618v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the approximation capabilities of dense neural networks. While universal approximation theorems establish that sufficiently large architectures can approximate arbitrary continuous functions if there are no restrictions on the weight values, we show that dense neural networks do not possess this universality. Our argument is based on a model compression approach, combining the weak regularity lemma with an interpretation of feedforward networks as message passing graph neural networks. We consider ReLU neural networks subject to natural constraints on weights and input and output dimensions, which model a notion of dense connectivity. Within this setting, we demonstrate the existence of Lipschitz continuous functions that cannot be approximated by such networks. This highlights intrinsic limitations of neural networks with dense layers and motivates the use of sparse connectivity as a necessary ingredient for achieving true universality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Position: Message-passing and spectral GNNs are two sides of the same coin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10031v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly divided into message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) and spectral graph neural networks, reflecting two largely separate research traditions in machine learning and signal processing. This paper argues that this divide is mostly artificial, hindering progress in the field. We propose a viewpoint in which both MPNNs and spectral GNNs are understood as different parametrizations of permutation-equivariant operators acting on graph signals. From this perspective, many popular architectures are equivalent in expressive power, while genuine gaps arise only in specific regimes. We further argue that MPNNs and spectral GNNs offer complementary strengths. That is, MPNNs provide a natural language for discrete structure and expressivity analysis using tools from logic and graph isomorphism research, while the spectral perspective provides principled tools for understanding smoothing, bottlenecks, stability, and community structure. Overall, we posit that progress in graph learning will be accelerated by clearly understanding the key similarities and differences between these two types of GNNs, and by working towards unifying these perspectives within a common theoretical and conceptual framework rather than treating them as competing paradigms.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach targets low-probability high-consequence outage scenarios and leverages a comprehensive set of features derived from publicly available data sources. We integrate EAGLE-I outage records from 2014 to 2024 with weather, socioeconomic, infrastructure, and seasonal event data. Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals patterns of community vulnerability and improves understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models are evaluated, including Random Forest (RF), Graph Neural Network (GNN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Experimental validation is performed on a large-scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves higher accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Tripartite Modularity for Clustering Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09864v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering heterogeneous relational data remains a central challenge in graph learning, particularly when interactions involve more than two types of entities. While differentiable modularity objectives such as DMoN have enabled end-to-end community detection on homogeneous and bipartite graphs, extending these approaches to higher-order relational structures remains non-trivial. In this work, we introduce a differentiable formulation of tripartite modularity for graphs composed of three node types connected through mediated interactions. Community structure is defined in terms of weighted co-paths across the tripartite graph, together with an exact factorized computation that avoids the explicit construction of dense third-order tensors. A structural normalization at pivot nodes is introduced to control extreme degree heterogeneity and ensure stable optimization. The resulting objective can be optimized jointly with a graph neural network in an end-to-end manner, while retaining linear complexity in the number of edges. We validate the proposed framework on large-scale urban cadastral data, where it exhibits robust convergence behavior and produces spatially coherent partitions. These results highlight differentiable tripartite modularity as a generic methodological building block for unsupervised clustering of heterogeneous graphs.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025), Main Track</p></details> |
| **[BRAVA-GNN: Betweenness Ranking Approximation Via Degree MAss Inspired Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09716v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing node importance in networks is a long-standing fundamental problem that has driven extensive study of various centrality measures. A particularly well-known centrality measure is betweenness centrality, which becomes computationally prohibitive on large-scale networks. Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have thus been proposed to predict node rankings according to their relative betweenness centrality. However, state-of-the-art methods fail to generalize to high-diameter graphs such as road networks. We propose BRAVA-GNN, a lightweight GNN architecture that leverages the empirically observed correlation linking betweenness centrality to degree-based quantities, in particular multi-hop degree mass. This correlation motivates the use of degree masses as size-invariant node features and synthetic training graphs that closely match the degree distributions of real networks. Furthermore, while previous work relies on scale-free synthetic graphs, we leverage the hyperbolic random graph model, which reproduces power-law exponents outside the scale-free regime, better capturing the structure of real-world graphs like road networks. This design enables BRAVA-GNN to generalize across diverse graph families while using 54x fewer parameters than the most lightweight existing GNN baseline. Extensive experiments on 19 real-world networks, spanning social, web, email, and road graphs, show that BRAVA-GNN achieves up to 214% improvement in Kendall-Tau correlation and up to 70x speedup in inference time over state-of-the-art GNN-based approaches, particularly on challenging road networks.</p></details> | Submitted to KDD |
| **[Scalable and Reliable State-Aware Inference of High-Impact N-k Contingencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09461v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasing penetration of inverter-based resources, flexible loads, and rapidly changing operating conditions make higher-order $N\!-\!k$ contingency assessment increasingly important but computationally prohibitive. Exhaustive evaluation of all outage combinations using AC power-flow or ACOPF is infeasible in routine operation. This fact forces operators to rely on heuristic screening methods whose ability to consistently retain all critical contingencies is not formally established. This paper proposes a scalable, state-aware contingency inference framework designed to directly generate high-impact $N\!-\!k$ outage scenarios without enumerating the combinatorial contingency space. The framework employs a conditional diffusion model to produce candidate contingencies tailored to the current operating state, while a topology-aware graph neural network trained only on base and $N\!-\!1$ cases efficiently constructs high-risk training samples offline. Finally, the framework is developed to provide controllable coverage guarantees for severe contingencies, allowing operators to explicitly manage the risk of missing critical events under limited AC power-flow evaluation budgets. Experiments on IEEE benchmark systems show that, for a given evaluation budget, the proposed approach consistently evaluates higher-severity contingencies than uniform sampling. This allows critical outages to be identified more reliably with reduced computational effort.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes a multimodal graph neural network framework that integrates structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI to model spatiotemporal brain network reorganization. Brain regions are represented as nodes and structural and functional connectivity as edges, forming longitudinal brain graphs for each subject. Temporal evolution is captured via fractional stochastic differential operators embedded within graph-based recurrent networks, enabling the modeling of long-term dependencies and stochastic fluctuations in network dynamics. Attention mechanisms fuse multimodal information and generate interpretable biomarkers, including network energy entropy, graph curvature, fractional memory indices, and modality-specific attention scores. These biomarkers are combined into a composite prognostic index to quantify individual risk of network instability or cognitive decline. Experiments on longitudinal neuroimaging datasets demonstrate both predictive accuracy and interpretability. The results highlight the potential of mathematically rigorous, multimodal graph-based approaches for deriving clinically meaningful biomarkers from existing imaging data without requiring new data collection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Funda...</summary><p>Fundamental methodological error invalidating results</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the exact subgraph enumeration, a neural network, and a sparse regularization by the mixed $L_{0,2}$ norm constraint. In general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph. Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on the selected subgraphs.</p></details> |  |

Existing graph domain adaptation (graph DA) methods often implicitly assume a mild shift between source and target graphs, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with large shifts. Gradual domain adaptation (GDA) has emerged as a promising approach for addressing large shifts by gradually adapting the source model to the target domain via a path of unlabeled intermediate domains. Existing GDA methods exclusively focus on independent and identically distributed (IID) data with a predefined path, leaving their extension to non-IID graphs without a given path an open challenge. To bridge this gap, we present Gadget, the first GDA framework for non-IID graph data. First (theoretical foundation), the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance is adopted as the domain discrepancy for non-IID graphs, based on which, we derive an error bound on node, edge and graph-level tasks, showing that the target domain error is proportional to the length of the path. Second (optimal path), guided by the error bound, we identify the FGW geodesic as the optimal path, which can be efficiently generated by our proposed algorithm. The generated path can be seamlessly integrated with existing graph DA methods to handle large shifts on graphs, improving state-of-the-art graph DA methods by up to 6.8% in accuracy on real-world datasets.</p></details> | 35 pages, 10 figures |

We show that static inference induces a fundamental tradeoff: improving stability requires reducing reliance on shift-sensitive features, leaving an irreducible worst-case generalization floor. Instance-conditional routing can break this ceiling, but is fragile because shifts can mislead routing and perturbations can make routing fluctuate. We capture these effects via two decompositions separating coverage vs selection, and base sensitivity vs fluctuation amplification. Based on these insights, we propose STEM-GNN, a pretrain-then-finetune framework with a mixture-of-experts encoder for diverse computation paths, a vector-quantized token interface to stabilize encoder-to-head signals, and a Lipschitz-regularized head to bound output amplification. Across nine node, link, and graph benchmarks, STEM-GNN achieves a stronger three-way balance, improving robustness to degree/homophily shifts and to feature/edge corruptions while remaining competitive on clean graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Graph...</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks, Generalization, Mixture of Experts</p></details> |

In this work, we focus on a prevalent yet under-explored phenomenon in graph generalization, Minimal Shift Flip (MSF),where test samples that slightly deviate from the training distribution are abruptly misclassified. To interpret this phenomenon, we revisit MSF through the lens of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which characterizes the local stability and sharpness of the loss landscape while providing a theoretical foundation for modeling generalization error. To quantify loss sharpness, we introduce the concept of Local Robust Radius, measuring the smallest perturbation required to flip a prediction and establishing a theoretical link between local stability and generalization. Building on this perspective, we further observe a continual decrease in the robust radius during training, indicating weakened local stability and an increasingly sharp loss landscape that gives rise to MSF. To jointly solve the MSF phenomenon and the intractability of radius, we develop an energy-based formulation that is theoretically proven to be monotonically correlated with the robust radius, offering a tractable and principled objective for modeling flatness and stability. Building on these insights, we propose an energy-driven generative augmentation framework (E2A) that leverages energy-guided latent perturbations to generate pseudo-OOD samples and enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that E2A consistently improves graph OOD generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Such analyses are of two varieties: 1) when the metric space includes graphs of unbounded sizes, the theory is only appropriate for dense graphs, and, 2) when studying sparse graphs, the metric space only includes graphs of uniformly bounded size. In this work, we present a unified approach, defining a compact metric on the space of graphs of all sizes, both sparse and dense, under which MPNNs are Hölder continuous. This leads to more powerful universal approximation theorems and generalization bounds than previous works. The theory is based on, and extends, a recent approach to graph limit theory called graphop analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, training GNNs without protection may leak sensitive personal information in graph data, including links and node features. Local differential privacy (LDP) is an advanced technique for protecting data privacy in decentralized networks. Unfortunately, existing local differentially private GNNs either only preserve link privacy or suffer significant utility loss in the process of preserving link and node feature privacy. In this paper, we propose an effective LDP framework, called HoGS, which trains GNNs with link and feature protection by generating a synthetic graph. Concretely, HoGS first collects the link and feature information of the graph under LDP, and then utilizes the phenomenon of homophily in graph data to reconstruct the graph structure and node features separately, thereby effectively mitigating the negative impact of LDP on the downstream GNN training. We theoretically analyze the privacy guarantee of HoGS and conduct experiments using the generated synthetic graph as input to various state-of-the-art GNN architectures. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that HoGS significantly outperforms baseline methods in the accuracy of training GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks have emerged as the main architecture for SAT solving, due to the natural graph representation of Boolean formulas. We analyze the expressive power of GNNs for SAT solving through the lens of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) test. As our main result, we prove that the full WL hierarchy cannot, in general, distinguish between satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances. We show that indistinguishability under higher-order WL carries over to practical limitations for WL-bounded solvers that set variables sequentially. We further study the expressivity required for several important families of SAT instances, including regular, random and planar instances. To quantify expressivity needs in practice, we conduct experiments on random instances from the G4SAT benchmark and industrial instances from the International SAT Competition. Our results suggest that while random instances are largely distinguishable, industrial instances often require more expressivity to predict a satisfying assignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, the continuous growth of their data scale poses a significant computational bottleneck for training. Graph condensation methods provide a feasible path forward by synthesizing compact and representative datasets. Nevertheless, existing condensation approaches generally suffer from performance limitations in multimodal scenarios, mainly due to two reasons: (1) semantic misalignment between different modalities leads to gradient conflicts; (2) the message-passing mechanism of graph neural networks further structurally amplifies such gradient noise. Based on this, we propose Structural Regularized Gradient Matching (SR-GM), a condensation framework for multimodal graphs. This method alleviates gradient conflicts between modalities through a gradient decoupling mechanism and introduces a structural damping regularizer to suppress the propagation of gradient noise in the topology, thereby transforming the graph structure from a noise amplifier into a training stabilizer. Extensive experiments on four multimodal graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SR-GM, highlighting its state-of-the-art performance and cross-architecture generalization capabilities in multimodal graph dataset condensation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12pag...</summary><p>12pages,7 figures,8 tables</p></details> |

However, the existing methods face notable limitations, including limited pre-training scale or heavy reliance on textual information. Motivated by the success of tabular foundation models (TFMs) in achieving universal prediction across diverse tabular datasets, we explore an alternative approach by TFMs, which are pre-trained on diverse synthetic datasets sampled from structural causal models and support strong in-context learning independent of textual attributes. Nevertheless, adapting TFMs for link prediction faces severe technical challenges such as how to obtain the necessary context and capture link-centric topological information. To solve these challenges, we propose TFMLinker (Tabular Foundation Model for Link Predictor), aiming to leverage the in-context learning capabilities of TFMs to perform link prediction across diverse graphs without requiring dataset-specific fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a prototype-augmented local-global context module to construct context that captures both graph-specific and cross-graph transferable patterns. Next, we design a universal topology-aware link encoder to capture link-centric topological information and generate link representations as inputs for the TFM. Finally, we employ the TFM to predict link existence through in-context learning. Experiments on 6 graph benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines without requiring dataset-specific finetuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Meta-Path Attention an Explanation? Evidence of Alignment and Decoupling in Heterogeneous GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08500v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta-path-based heterogeneous graph neural networks aggregate over meta-path-induced views, and their semantic-level attention over meta-path channels is widely used as a narrative for ``which semantics matter.'' We study this assumption empirically by asking: when does meta-path attention reflect meta-path importance, and when can it decouple? A key challenge is that most post-hoc GNN explainers are designed for homogeneous graphs, and naive adaptations to heterogeneous neighborhoods can mix semantics and confound perturbations. To enable a controlled empirical analysis, we introduce MetaXplain, a meta-path-aware post-hoc explanation protocol that applies existing explainers in the native meta-path view domain via (i) view-factorized explanations, (ii) schema-valid channel-wise perturbations, and (iii) fusion-aware attribution, without modifying the underlying predictor. We benchmark representative gradient-, perturbation-, and Shapley-style explainers on ACM, DBLP, and IMDB with HAN and HAN-GCN, comparing against xPath and type-matched random baselines under standard faithfulness metrics. To quantify attention reliability, we propose Meta-Path Attention--Explanation Alignment (MP-AEA), which measures rank correlation between learned attention weights and explanation-derived meta-path contribution scores across random runs. Our results show that meta-path-aware explanations typically outperform random controls, while MP-AEA reveals both high-alignment and statistically significant decoupling regimes depending on the dataset and backbone; moreover, retraining on explanation-induced subgraphs often preserves, and in some noisy regimes improves, predictive performance, suggesting an explanation-as-denoising effect.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Graph Knowledge Distillation from GNNs to Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks via Self-Attention Dynamic Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00560v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success of graph neural networks (GNNs) in modeling complex graph-structured data has fueled interest in deploying them on resource-constrained edge devices. However, their substantial computational and memory demands present ongoing challenges. Knowledge distillation (KD) from GNNs to MLPs offers a lightweight alternative, but MLPs remain limited by fixed activations and the absence of neighborhood aggregation, constraining distilled performance. To tackle these intertwined limitations, we propose SA-DSD, a novel self-attention-guided dynamic sampling distillation framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ an enhanced Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as the student model. We improve Fourier KAN (FR-KAN+) with learnable frequency bases, phase shifts, and optimized algorithms, substantially improving nonlinear fitting capability over MLPs while preserving low computational complexity. To explicitly compensate for the absence of neighborhood aggregation that is inherent to both MLPs and KAN-based students, SA-DSD leverages a self-attention mechanism to dynamically identify influential nodes, construct adaptive sampling probability matrices, and enforce teacher-student prediction consistency. Extensive experiments on six real world datasets demonstrate that, under inductive and most of transductive settings, SA-DSD surpasses three GNN teachers by 3.05%-3.62% and improves FR-KAN+ by 15.61%. Moreover, it achieves a 16.69x parameter reduction and a 55.75% decrease in average runtime per epoch compared to key benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Reasoning in the Embedding Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02018v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this contribution, we demonstrate that Graph Neural Networks and Transformers can learn to reason about geometric constraints. We train them to predict spatial position of points in a discrete 2D grid from a set of constraints that uniquely describe hidden figures containing these points. Both models are able to predict the position of points and interestingly, they form the hidden figures described by the input constraints in the embedding space during the reasoning process. Our analysis shows that both models recover the grid structure during training so that the embeddings corresponding to the points within the grid organize themselves in a 2D subspace and reflect the neighborhood structure of the grid. We also show that the Graph Neural Network we design for the task performs significantly better than the Transformer and is also easier to scale.</p></details> |  |

First, YOLO 11x detects and crops human portraits frame-by-frame, and DINOv2-Base extracts visual features from the cropped regions. Next, by integrating Chain-of-Thought and Reflection prompting (CoT + Reflection), Gemini 2.5 Pro automatically generates pseudo-labels and reasoning texts that serve as weak supervision for downstream models. Subsequently, OpenPose produces 137-dimensional key-point sequences, augmented with inter-frame offset features; the usual graph neural network backbone is simplified to an MLP to efficiently model the spatiotemporal relationships of the three key-point streams. An ultra-long-sequence Transformer independently encodes both the image and key-point sequences, and their representations are concatenated with BERT-encoded interview transcripts. Each modality is first pre-trained in isolation, then fine-tuned jointly, with pseudo-labeled samples merged into the training set for further gains. Experiments demonstrate that, despite severe class imbalance, the proposed approach lifts accuracy from under 0.6 in prior work to over 0.69, establishing a new public benchmark. The study also validates that an "MLP-ified" key-point backbone can match - or even surpass - GCN-based counterparts in this task.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods struggle to balance minimizing Total Weighted Tardiness (TWT) and Total Setup Time (TST). This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The GNN effectively represents the complex state of jobs, machines, and setups, allowing the PPO agent to learn a direct scheduling policy. Guided by a multi-objective reward function, the agent simultaneously minimizes TWT and TST. Experimental results on benchmark instances demonstrate that our PPO-GNN agent significantly outperforms a standard dispatching rule and a metaheuristic, achieving a superior trade-off between both objectives. This provides a robust and scalable solution for complex manufacturing scheduling.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, Winter Simulation Conference (WSC) 2025</p></details> |
| **[PhysDrape: Learning Explicit Forces and Collision Constraints for Physically Realistic Garment Draping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08020v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based garment draping has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Physics-Based Simulation (PBS), yet robust collision handling remains a critical bottleneck. Most existing methods enforce physical validity through soft penalties, creating an intrinsic trade-off between geometric feasibility and physical plausibility: penalizing collisions often distorts mesh structure, while preserving shape leads to interpenetration. To resolve this conflict, we present PhysDrape, a hybrid neural-physical solver for physically realistic garment draping driven by explicit forces and constraints. Unlike soft-constrained frameworks, PhysDrape integrates neural inference with explicit geometric solvers in a fully differentiable pipeline. Specifically, we propose a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network conditioned on a physics-enriched graph -- encoding material parameters and body proximity -- to predict residual displacements. Crucially, we integrate a differentiable two-stage solver: first, a learnable Force Solver iteratively resolves unbalanced forces derived from the Saint Venant-Kirchhoff (StVK) model to ensure quasi-static equilibrium; second, a Differentiable Projection strictly enforces collision constraints against the body surface. This differentiable design guarantees physical validity through explicit constraints, while enabling end-to-end learning to optimize the network for physically consistent predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysDrape achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring negligible interpenetration with significantly lower strain energy compared to existing baselines, achieving superior physical fidelity and robustness in real-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Structural and Semantic Signals in Text-Attributed Graphs with BiGTex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12474v4)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges in representation learning by requiring models to capture both the semantic richness of node-associated texts and the structural dependencies of the graph. While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions, text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Learning Geometric-Aware Quadrature Rules for Functional Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05445v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate numerical integration over non-uniform point clouds is a challenge for modern mesh-free machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) using variational principles. While standard Monte Carlo (MC) methods are not capable of handling a non-uniform point cloud, modern neural network architectures can deal with permutation-invariant inputs, creating quadrature rules for any point cloud. In this work, we introduce QuadrANN, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture designed to learn optimal quadrature weights directly from the underlying geometry of point clouds. The design of the model exploits a deep message-passing scheme where the initial layer encodes rich local geometric features from absolute and relative positions as well as an explicit local density measure. In contrast, the following layers incorporate a global context vector. These architectural choices allow the QuadrANN to generate a data-driven quadrature rule that is permutation-invariant and adaptive to both local point density and the overall domain shape. We test our methodology on a series of challenging test cases, including integration on convex and non-convex domains and estimating the solution of the Heat and Fokker-Planck equations. Across all the tests, QuadrANN reduces the variance of the integral estimation compared to standard Quasi-Monte Carlo methods by warping the point clouds to be more dense in critical areas where the integrands present certain singularities. This enhanced stability in critical areas of the domain at hand is critical for the optimization of energy functionals, leading to improved deep learning-based variational solvers.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
| **[LogicXGNN: Grounded Logical Rules for Explaining Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19476v4)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing rule-based explanations for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide global interpretability but often optimize and assess fidelity in an intermediate, uninterpretable concept space, overlooking grounding quality for end users in the final subgraph explanations. This gap yields explanations that may appear faithful yet be unreliable in practice. To this end, we propose LogicXGNN, a post-hoc framework that constructs logical rules over reliable predicates explicitly designed to capture the GNN's message-passing structure, thereby ensuring effective grounding. We further introduce data-grounded fidelity ($\textit{Fid}_{\mathcal{D}}$), a realistic metric that evaluates explanations in their final-graph form, along with complementary utility metrics such as coverage and validity. Across extensive experiments, LogicXGNN improves $\textit{Fid}_{\mathcal{D}}$ by over 20% on average relative to state-of-the-art methods while being 10-100 $\times$ faster. With strong scalability and utility performance, LogicXGNN produces explanations that are faithful to the model's logic and reliably grounded in observable data.

However, existing DONNs and other physics-based neural networks have mostly focused on exploring their machine intelligence, with limited studies in handling graph-structured tasks. Thus, we introduce HoloGraph, the first monolithic free-space all-optical graph neural network system. It proposes a novel, domain-specific message-passing mechanism with optical skip channels integrated into light propagation for the all-optical graph learning. HoloGraph enables light-speed optical message passing over graph structures with diffractive propagation and phase modulations. Our experimental results with HoloGraph, conducted using standard graph learning datasets Cora-ML and Citeseer, show competitive or even superior classification performance compared to conventional digital graph neural networks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed novel architecture and algorithmic methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying Explanation Quality in Graph Neural Networks using Out-of-Distribution Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07708v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the quality of post-hoc explanations for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) remains a significant challenge. While recent years have seen an increasing development of explainability methods, current evaluation metrics (e.g., fidelity, sparsity) often fail to assess whether an explanation identifies the true underlying causal variables. To address this, we propose the Explanation-Generalization Score (EGS), a metric that quantifies the causal relevance of GNN explanations. EGS is founded on the principle of feature invariance and posits that if an explanation captures true causal drivers, it should lead to stable predictions across distribution shifts. To quantify this, we introduce a framework that trains GNNs using explanatory subgraphs and evaluates their performance in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) settings (here, OOD generalization serves as a rigorous proxy for the explanation's causal validity). Through large-scale validation involving 11,200 model combinations across synthetic and real-world datasets, our results demonstrate that EGS provides a principled benchmark for ranking explainers based on their ability to capture causal substructures, offering a robust alternative to traditional fidelity-based metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaPGNN: Optimizing Parallel Graph Neural Network Training with Joint Caching and Resource-Aware Graph Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13716v2)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in the real world, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular in various fields due to their ability to process such irregular data directly. However, as data scale, GNNs become inefficient. Although parallel training offers performance improvements, increased communication costs often offset these advantages. To address this, this paper introduces CaPGNN, a novel parallel full-batch GNN training framework on single-server with multi-GPU. Firstly, considering the fact that the number of remote vertices in a partition is often greater than or equal to the number of local vertices and there may exist many duplicate vertices, we propose a joint adaptive caching algorithm that leverages both CPU and GPU memory, integrating lightweight cache update and prefetch techniques to effectively reduce redundant communication costs. Furthermore, taking into account the varying computational and communication capabilities among GPUs, we propose a communication- and computation-aware heuristic graph partitioning algorithm inspired by graph sparsification. Additionally, we implement a pipeline to overlap computation and communication. Extensive experiments show that CaPGNN improves training efficiency by up to 18.98x and reduces communication costs by up to 99%, with minimal accuracy loss or even accuracy improvement in some cases. Finally, we extend CaPGNN to multi-machine multi-GPU environments. The code is available at https://github.com/songxf1024/CaPGNN.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by discrete physics losses and Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network (HiDeNN) constructions, we embed finite-element (FEM) computations at nodes and Gauss points directly into message-passing layers and propose a numerically consistent FEM-Informed Hypergraph Neural Networks (FHGNN). Similar to conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), training is purely physics-driven and requires no labeled data: the input is a node element hypergraph whose edges encode mesh connectivity. Guided by empirical results and condition-number analysis, we adopt an efficient variational loss. Validated on 3D benchmarks, including cyclic loading with isotropic/kinematic hardening, the proposed method delivers substantially improved accuracy and efficiency over recent, competitive PINN variants. By leveraging GPU-parallel tensor operations and the discrete representation, it scales effectively to large elastoplastic problems and can be competitive with, or faster than, multi-core FEM implementations at comparable accuracy. This work establishes a foundation for scalable, physics-embedded learning in nonlinear solid mechanics.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 26 figures, 8tables</p></details> |

In this article, we address task scheduling for lifelong Multi-Agent Pickup-and-Delivery (MAPD) and propose a hybrid method that couples learning-based global guidance with lightweight optimization. A graph neural network policy trained via reinforcement learning outputs a desired distribution of free agents over an aggregated warehouse graph. This signal is converted into region-to-region rebalancing through a minimum-cost flow, and finalized by small, local assignment problems, preserving accuracy while keeping per-step latency within a 1 s compute budget. On congested warehouse benchmarks from the League of Robot Runners (LoRR) with up to 500 agents, our approach improves throughput by up to 10% over the 2024 winning scheduler while maintaining real-time execution. The results indicate that coupling graph-structured learned guidance with tractable solvers reduces congestion and yields a practical, scalable blueprint for high-throughput scheduling in large fleets.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

While substantial progress has been made in single-table synthetic generation where data are modeled at the row or item level, most real-world data exists in relational databases where a user's information spans items across multiple interconnected tables. Recent advances in synthetic relational data generation have emerged to address this complexity, yet release of these data introduce unique privacy challenges as information can be leaked not only from individual items but also through the relationships that comprise a complete user entity. To address this, we propose a novel Membership Inference Attack (MIA) setting to audit the empirical user-level privacy of synthetic relational data and show that single-table MIAs that audit at an item level underestimate user-level privacy leakage. We then propose Multi-Table Membership Inference Attack (MT-MIA), a novel adversarial attack under a No-Box threat model that targets learned representations of user entities via Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks. By incorporating all connected items for a user, MT-MIA better targets user-level vulnerabilities induced by inter-tabular relationships than existing attacks. We evaluate MT-MIA on a range of real-world multi-table datasets and demonstrate that this vulnerability exists in state-of-the-art relational synthetic data generators, employing MT-MIA to additionally study where this leakage occurs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpreting Manifolds and Graph Neural Embeddings from Internet of Things Traffic Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05817v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has led to increasingly complex and heterogeneous network topologies. Traditional network monitoring and visualization tools rely on aggregated metrics or static representations, which fail to capture the evolving relationships and structural dependencies between devices. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful way to learn from relational data, their internal representations often remain opaque and difficult to interpret for security-critical operations. Consequently, this work introduces an interpretable pipeline that generates directly visualizable low-dimensional representations by mapping high-dimensional embeddings onto a latent manifold. This projection enables the interpretable monitoring and interoperability of evolving network states, while integrated feature attribution techniques decode the specific characteristics shaping the manifold structure. The framework achieves a classification F1-score of 0.830 for intrusion detection while also highlighting phenomena such as concept drift. Ultimately, the presented approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional GNN embeddings and human-understandable network behavior, offering new insights for network administrators and security analysts.</p></details> |  |

The planning objective is to find a best-effort solution that avoids all hard constraint regions while minimally traversing the least risky areas. Conventional methods often rely on pre-defined area costs, limiting generalizations. Further, the spatial continuity of navigation spaces makes it difficult to identify regions that are passable without overestimation. To overcome these challenges, we propose SuReNav, a superpixel graph-based constraint relaxation and navigation method that imitates human-like safe and efficient navigation. Our framework consists of three components: 1) superpixel graph map generation with regional constraints, 2) regional-constraint relaxation using graph neural network trained on human demonstrations for safe and efficient navigation, and 3) interleaving relaxation, planning, and execution for complete navigation. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art baselines on 2D semantic maps and 3D maps from OpenStreetMap, achieving the highest human-likeness score of complete navigation while maintaining a balanced trade-off between efficiency and safety. We finally demonstrate its scalability and generalization performance in real-world urban navigation with a quadruped robot, Spot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2026.

To address this, we introduce the categorical Weisfeiler-Lehman framework, which formalizes lifting as a functorial mapping from an arbitrary data category to the unifying category of graded posets. When applied to hypergraphs, this perspective allows us to systematically derive Hypergraph Isomorphism Networks, a family of neural architectures where the message passing topology is strictly determined by the choice of functor. We introduce two distinct functors from the category of hypergraphs: an incidence functor and a symmetric simplicial complex functor. While the incidence architecture structurally mirrors standard bipartite schemes, our functorial derivation enforces a richer information flow over the resulting poset, capturing complex intersection geometries often missed by existing methods. We theoretically characterize the expressivity of these models, proving that both the incidence-based and symmetric simplicial approaches subsume the expressive power of the standard Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks validate these theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments are welcome!</p></details> |

Solving MAPF optimally is known to be NP-hard, leading to the adoption of learning-based approaches to alleviate the online computational burden. Prevailing approaches, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically constrained to pairwise message passing between agents. However, this limitation leads to suboptimal behaviours and critical issues, such as attention dilution, particularly in dense environments where group (i.e. beyond just two agents) coordination is most critical. Despite the importance of such higher-order interactions, existing approaches have not been able to fully explore them. To address this representational bottleneck, we introduce HMAGAT (Hypergraph Multi-Agent Attention Network), a novel architecture that leverages attentional mechanisms over directed hypergraphs to explicitly capture group dynamics. Empirically, HMAGAT establishes a new state-of-the-art among learning-based MAPF solvers: e.g., despite having just 1M parameters and being trained on 100$\times$ less data, it outperforms the current SoTA 85M parameter model. Through detailed analysis of HMAGAT's attention values, we demonstrate how hypergraph representations mitigate the attention dilution inherent in GNNs and capture complex interactions where pairwise methods fail. Our results illustrate that appropriate inductive biases are often more critical than the training data size or sheer parameter count for multi-agent problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks (GNNs). These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the intended functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first full graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide fine-grained guidance for unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning, it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple-node removal under both white-box and black-box settings, showcasing its practical feasibility and potential to cause considerable harm. We highlight the necessity of worst-case analysis and propose a systematic evaluation framework to assess attack performance under both random and worst-case node removal scenarios. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack or even amplify its performance in some cases. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for more effective and robust defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning through GNN-Derived Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12840v4)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.</p></details> |  |

The method is designed to guide the learning process through successive approximations, starting from reduced-order and full Stokes models, and progressively approaching the Navier--Stokes solution. To effectively capture both local and long-range dependencies in the velocity and pressure fields, we combine graph neural networks with Transformer and Mamba architectures. While Transformers achieve the highest accuracy, we show that Mamba can be successfully adapted to graph-structured data through an unsupervised node-ordering strategy. The Mamba approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining performance. Physical knowledge is embedded directly into the architecture through an encoding-processing-physics informed decoding pipeline. Derivatives are computed through algebraic operators constructed via the Weighted Least Squares method. The flexibility of these operators allows us not only to make the output obey the governing equations, but also to constrain selected hidden features to satisfy mass conservation. We introduce additional physical biases through an enriched graph convolution with the same differential operators describing the PDEs. Overall, we successfully guide the learning process by physical knowledge and fluid dynamics insights, leading to more regular and accurate predictions</p></details> |  |
| **[Which Graph Shift Operator? A Spectral Answer to an Empirical Question](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06557v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have established themselves as the leading models for learning on graph-structured data, generally categorized into spatial and spectral approaches. Central to these architectures is the Graph Shift Operator (GSO), a matrix representation of the graph structure used to filter node signals. However, selecting the optimal GSO, whether fixed or learnable, remains largely empirical. In this paper, we introduce a novel alignment gain metric that quantifies the geometric distortion between the input signal and label subspaces. Crucially, our theoretical analysis connects this alignment directly to generalization bounds via a spectral proxy for the Lipschitz constant. This yields a principled, computation-efficient criterion to rank and select the optimal GSO for any prediction task prior to training, eliminating the need for extensive search.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of OSS contributor networks using advanced graph neural networks and temporal network analysis on data spanning 25 years from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ecosystem, encompassing sandbox, incubating, and graduated projects. Our analysis of thousands of contributors across hundreds of repositories reveals that OSS networks exhibit strong power-law distributions in influence, with the top 1\% of contributors controlling a substantial portion of network influence. Using GPU-accelerated PageRank, betweenness centrality, and custom LSTM models, we identify five distinct contributor roles: Core, Bridge, Connector, Regular, and Peripheral, each with unique network positions and structural importance. Statistical analysis reveals significant correlations between specific action types (commits, pull requests, issues) and contributor influence, with multiple regression models explaining substantial variance in influence metrics. Temporal analysis shows that network density, clustering coefficients, and modularity exhibit statistically significant temporal trends, with distinct regime changes coinciding with major project milestones. Structural integrity simulations show that Bridge contributors, despite representing a small fraction of the network, have a disproportionate impact on network cohesion when removed. Our findings provide empirical evidence for strategic contributor retention policies and offer actionable insights into community health metrics.</p></details> |  |

The most effective way to prevent fraud is by contacting customers to verify suspicious transactions. However, while these systems are designed to detect fraudulent activity, they often mistakenly flag legitimate transactions, leading to unnecessary declines that disrupt the user experience and erode customer trust. Frequent false positives can frustrate customers, resulting in dissatisfaction, increased complaints, and a diminished sense of security. To address these limitations, we propose a fraud detection framework incorporating Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of identifying fraudulent transactions. By leveraging the relational structure of transaction data, our model reduces the need for direct customer confirmation while maintaining high detection performance. Our experiments are conducted using the IBM credit card transaction dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE 7th International Conference on Communications, Information System and Computer Engineering (CISCE), pp. 320-324.

To address challenges arising from increased traffic and diverse network architectures, organizations employ automated tools for firewall rule and access policy generation. Yet, effectively managing risks arising from dynamically generated policies, especially concerning critical asset exposure, remains a major challenge. This challenge is amplified by evolving network structures due to trends like remote users, bring-your-own devices, and cloud integration. This paper introduces a novel graph neural network model for identifying weighted shortest paths. The model aids in detecting network misconfigurations and high-risk connectivity paths that threaten critical assets, potentially exploited in zero-day attacks -- cyber-attacks exploiting undisclosed vulnerabilities. The proposed Pro-ZD framework adopts a proactive approach, automatically fine-tuning firewall rules and access policies to address high-risk connections and prevent unauthorized access. Experimental results highlight the robustness and transferability of Pro-ZD, achieving over 95% average accuracy in detecting high-risk connections. \</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel framework, ATEX-CF that unifies adversarial attack techniques with counterfactual explanation generation-a connection made feasible by their shared goal of flipping a node's prediction, yet differing in perturbation strategy: adversarial attacks often rely on edge additions, while counterfactual methods typically use deletions. Unlike traditional approaches that treat explanation and attack separately, our method efficiently integrates both edge additions and deletions, grounded in theory, leveraging adversarial insights to explore impactful counterfactuals. In addition, by jointly optimizing fidelity, sparsity, and plausibility under a constrained perturbation budget, our method produces instance-level explanations that are both informative and realistic. Experiments on synthetic and real-world node classification benchmarks demonstrate that ATEX-CF generates faithful, concise, and plausible explanations, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating adversarial insights into counterfactual reasoning for GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, accepted by ICLR 2026, github code:https://github.com/zhangyuo/ATEX_CF</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code from natural language queries, runtime code generation is severely limited due to unverified code, security risks, longer response times, and higher computational costs. To bridge the gap, we propose an offline simulation framework to curate a software-specific skillset, a collection of verified scripts, by exploiting LLMs and publicly available scripting guides. Our framework comprises two components: (1) task creation, using top-down functionality guidance and bottom-up API synergy exploration to generate helpful tasks; and (2) skill generation with trials, refining and validating scripts based on execution feedback. To efficiently navigate the extensive API landscape, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based link prediction model to capture API synergy, enabling the generation of skills involving underutilized APIs and expanding the skillset's diversity. Experiments with Adobe Illustrator demonstrate that our framework significantly improves automation success rates, reduces response time, and saves runtime token costs compared to traditional runtime code generation. This is the first attempt to use software scripting interfaces as a testbed for LLM-based systems, highlighting the advantages of leveraging execution feedback in a controlled environment and offering valuable insights into aligning AI capabilities with user needs in specialized software domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EACL 2026</p></details> |

Machine learning has become an invaluable tool for scaling physics-based simulators and developing models directly from experimental data. In particular, recent advances in deep generative modeling and geometric deep learning enable probabilistic simulation by learning complex trajectory distributions while respecting intrinsic permutation and time-shift symmetries. However, trajectories of N-body systems are commonly characterized by high sensitivity to perturbations leading to bifurcations, as well as multi-scale temporal and spatial correlations. To address these challenges, we introduce STFlow (Spatio-Temporal Flow), a generative model based on graph neural networks and hierarchical convolutions. By incorporating data-dependent couplings within the Flow Matching framework, STFlow denoises starting from conditioned random-walks instead of Gaussian noise. This novel informed prior simplifies the learning task by reducing transport cost, increasing training and inference efficiency. We validate our approach on N-body systems, molecular dynamics, and human trajectory forecasting. Across these benchmarks, STFlow achieves the lowest prediction errors with fewer simulation steps and improved scalability.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Breaking Symmetry Bottlenecks in GNN Readouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05950v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning on structured data, yet their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs is fundamentally limited. These limitations are usually attributed to message passing; in this work we show that an independent bottleneck arises at the readout stage. Using finite-dimensional representation theory, we prove that all linear permutation-invariant readouts, including sum and mean pooling, factor through the Reynolds (group-averaging) operator and therefore project node embeddings onto the fixed subspace of the permutation action, erasing all non-trivial symmetry-aware components regardless of encoder expressivity. This yields both a new expressivity barrier and an interpretable characterization of what global pooling preserves or destroys. To overcome this collapse, we introduce projector-based invariant readouts that decompose node representations into symmetry-aware channels and summarize them with nonlinear invariant statistics, preserving permutation invariance while retaining information provably invisible to averaging. Empirically, swapping only the readout enables fixed encoders to separate WL-hard graph pairs and improves performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that readout design is a decisive and under-appreciated factor in GNN expressivity.</p></details> | 23 pages |

In this work, we study GNN robustness to label noise, demonstrate GNN failure modes when models struggle to generalise on low-order graphs, low label coverage, or when a model is over-parameterized. We establish both empirical and theoretical links between GNN robustness and the reduction of the total Dirichlet Energy of learned node representations, which encapsulates the hypothesized GNN smoothness inductive bias. Finally, we introduce two training strategies to enhance GNN robustness: (1) by incorporating a novel inductive bias in the weight matrices through the removal of negative eigenvalues, connected to Dirichlet Energy minimization; (2) by extending to GNNs a loss penalty that promotes learned smoothness. Importantly, neither approach negatively impacts performance in noise-free settings, supporting our hypothesis that the source of GNNs robustness is their smoothness inductive bias.</p></details> |  |

While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used to learn from such data, counterfactual graph learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve model interpretability. Counterfactual explanation research focuses on identifying a counterfactual graph that is similar to the original but leads to different predictions. These explanations optimize two objectives simultaneously: the sparsity of changes in the counterfactual graph and the validity of its predictions. Building on these qualitative optimization goals, this paper introduces CFRecs, a novel framework that transforms counterfactual explanations into actionable insights. CFRecs employs a two-stage architecture consisting of a graph neural network (GNN) and a graph variational auto-encoder (Graph-VAE) to strategically propose minimal yet high-impact changes in graph structure and node attributes to drive desirable outcomes in recommender systems. We apply CFRecs to Zillow's graph-structured data to deliver actionable recommendations for both home buyers and sellers with the goal of helping them navigate the competitive housing market and achieve their homeownership goals. Experimental results on Zillow's user-listing interaction data demonstrate the effectiveness of CFRecs, which also provides a fresh perspective on recommendations using counterfactual reasoning in graphs.</p></details> |  |

STProtein is designed to accurately predict unknown spatial protein expression using more accessible spatial multi-omics data, such as spatial transcriptomics. We believe that STProtein can effectively addresses the scarcity of spatial proteomics, accelerating the integration of spatial multi-omics and potentially catalyzing transformative breakthroughs in life sciences.

However, their asynchronous and sparse data format poses a significant challenge for conventional deep learning methods. Existing methods either convert the events into dense synchronous frame representations for processing by powerful CNNs or Transformers, but lose the asynchronous, sparse and high temporal resolution characteristics of events during the conversion process; or adopt irregular models such as sparse convolution, spiking neural networks, or graph neural networks to process the irregular event representations but fail to take full advantage of GPU acceleration. Inspired by word-to-vector models, we draw an analogy between words and events to introduce event2vec, a novel representation that allows neural networks to process events directly. This approach is fully compatible with the parallel processing capabilities of Transformers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of event2vec on the DVS Gesture, ASL-DVS, and DVS-Lip benchmarks, showing that event2vec is remarkably parameter-efficient, features high throughput and low latency, and achieves high accuracy even with an extremely low number of events or low spatial resolutions. Event2vec introduces a novel paradigm by demonstrating for the first time that sparse, irregular event data can be directly integrated into high-throughput Transformer architectures. This breakthrough resolves the long-standing conflict between maintaining data sparsity and maximizing GPU efficiency, offering a promising balance for real-time, low-latency neuromorphic vision tasks.

Therefore, it is crucial to identify how model performance scales with dataset size and model capacity to distinguish between data- and model-limited regimes. Neural scaling laws provide a framework for quantifying this behavior and guide the design of materials datasets and machine learning architectures. Here, we investigate neural scaling laws for a paradigmatic materials science task: predicting the dielectric function of metals, a high-dimensional response that governs how solids interact with light. Using over 200,000 dielectric functions from high-throughput ab initio calculations, we study two multi-objective graph neural networks trained to predict the frequency-dependent complex interband dielectric function and the Drude frequency. We observe broken neural scaling laws with respect to dataset size, whereas scaling with the number of model parameters follows a simple power law that rapidly saturates.</p></details> |  |
| **[EdgeMask-DG*: Learning Domain-Invariant Graph Structures via Adversarial Edge Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05571v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structural shifts pose a significant challenge for graph neural networks, as graph topology acts as a covariate that can vary across domains. Existing domain generalization methods rely on fixed structural augmentations or training on globally perturbed graphs, mechanisms that do not pinpoint which specific edges encode domain-invariant information. We argue that domain-invariant structural information is not rigidly tied to a single topology but resides in the consensus across multiple graph structures derived from topology and feature similarity. To capture this, we first propose EdgeMask-DG, a novel min-max algorithm where an edge masker learns to find worst-case continuous masks subject to a sparsity constraint, compelling a task GNN to perform effectively under these adversarial structural perturbations. Building upon this, we introduce EdgeMask-DG*, an extension that applies this adversarial masking principle to an enriched graph. This enriched graph combines the original topology with feature-derived edges, allowing the model to discover invariances even when the original topology is noisy or domain-specific. EdgeMask-DG* is the first to systematically combine adaptive adversarial topology search with feature-enriched graphs. We provide a formal justification for our approach from a robust optimization perspective. We demonstrate that EdgeMask-DG* achieves new state-of-the-art performance on diverse graph domain generalization benchmarks, including citation networks, social networks, and temporal graphs. Notably, on the Cora OOD benchmark, EdgeMask-DG* lifts the worst-case domain accuracy to 78.0\%, a +3.8 pp improvement over the prior state of the art (74.2\%).

Graph prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, yet most methods only modify inputs or representations and leave message passing unchanged, limiting their ability to adapt neighborhood interactions. We propose message-adaptive graph prompt tuning, which injects learnable prompts into the message passing step to reweight incoming neighbor messages and add task-specific prompt vectors during message aggregation, while keeping the backbone GNN frozen. The approach is compatible with common GNN backbones and pre-training strategies, and applicable across downstream settings. Experiments on diverse node- and graph-level datasets show consistent gains over prior graph prompting methods in few-shot settings, while achieving performance competitive with fine-tuning in full-shot regimes.</p></details> |  |

However, such approaches often ignore some useful information that might help improve localization performance, such as 1) the interaction relationship between bug reports and source code files; 2) the similarity relationship between bug reports; and 3) the co-citation relationship between source code files. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Multi-View Adaptive Contrastive Learning for Information Retrieval Fault Localization (MACL-IRFL) to learn the above-mentioned relationships for software fault localization. Specifically, we first generate data augmentations from report-code interaction view, report-report similarity view and code-code co-citation view separately, and adopt graph neural network to aggregate the information of bug reports or source code files from the three views in the embedding process. Moreover, we perform contrastive learning across these views. Our design of contrastive learning task will force the bug report representations to encode information shared by report-report and report-code views,and the source code file representations shared by code-code and report-code views, thereby alleviating the noise from auxiliary information. Finally, to evaluate the performance of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on five open-source Java projects. The results show that our model can improve over the best baseline up to 28.93%, 25.57% and 20.35% on Accuracy@1, MAP and MRR, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted by Automated Software Engineering in 18 October 2025</p></details> |

However, graph neural networks suffer from oversmoothing, where a node's features become increasingly similar to those of its neighbors. Unitary graph convolutions, which are mathematically constrained to preserve smoothness, have been proposed to address this issue. Despite this, in many physical systems, such as diffusion processes, smoothness naturally increases and unitarity may be overconstraining. In this paper, we systematically study the smoothing effects of different GNNs for dynamics modeling and prove that unitary convolutions hurt performance for such tasks. We propose relaxed unitary convolutions that balance smoothness preservation with the natural smoothing required for physical systems. We also generalize unitary and relaxed unitary convolutions from graphs to meshes. In experiments on PDEs such as the heat and wave equations over complex meshes and on weather forecasting, we find that our method outperforms several strong baselines, including mesh-aware transformers and equivariant neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ecsta...</summary><p>Ecstatic to share relaxed unitary mesh convolutions with the community :D!

However, commonly used Graph Neural Network models suffer from fundamental limitations in capturing complex structural patterns and long-range dependencies that are inherent in relational data. While Graph Transformers have emerged as powerful alternatives to GNNs on general graphs, applying them to relational entity graphs presents unique challenges: (i) Traditional positional encodings fail to generalize to massive, heterogeneous graphs; (ii) existing architectures cannot model the temporal dynamics and schema constraints of relational data; (iii) existing tokenization schemes lose critical structural information. Here we introduce the Relational Graph Transformer (RelGT), the first graph transformer architecture designed specifically for relational tables. RelGT employs a novel multi-element tokenization strategy that decomposes each node into five components (features, type, hop distance, time, and local structure), enabling efficient encoding of heterogeneity, temporality, and topology without expensive precomputation. Our architecture combines local attention over sampled subgraphs with global attention to learnable centroids, incorporating both local and database-wide representations. Across 21 tasks from the RelBench benchmark, RelGT consistently matches or outperforms GNN baselines by up to 18%, establishing Graph Transformers as a powerful architecture for Relational Deep Learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026, Code: https://github.com/snap-stanford/relgt</p></details> |

Traditional methods such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization. To alleviate these limitations, graph-based approaches have been proposed; however, they still rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which often capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts as well as significant engineering costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose AMR (Aspect-aware MOOC Recommendation), a novel framework that models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath. AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in the learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs to achieve fine-grained semantically informed KC recommendations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale MOOCCube and PEEK datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics such as HR@K and nDCG@K. Further analysis confirms that AMR effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information, allowing more accurate recommendations than those methods that rely solely on predefined metapaths. The code will be available upon accepted.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements using graph neural networks (GNNs), two major challenges persist. At the model level, most methods adopt a transductive learning paradigm, which assumes static graph structures, making them unsuitable for dynamic, evolving networks. At the data level, the extreme class imbalance, where anomalous nodes are rare, leads to biased models that fail to generalize to unseen anomalies. These challenges are interdependent: static transductive frameworks limit effective data augmentation, while imbalance exacerbates model distortion in inductive learning settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel data-centric framework that integrates dynamic graph modeling with balanced anomaly synthesis. Our framework features: (1) a discrete ego-graph diffusion model, which captures the local topology of anomalies to generate ego-graphs aligned with anomalous structural distribution, and (2) a curriculum anomaly augmentation mechanism, which dynamically adjusts synthetic data generation during training, focusing on underrepresented anomaly patterns to improve detection and generalization. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,6 figures, Accepted by ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '26)</p></details> |

However, most deep generative models focus exclusively on perfectly ordered crystals, neglecting the important class of disordered materials. To address this gap, we introduce DMFlow, a generative framework specifically designed for disordered crystals. Our approach introduces a unified representation for ordered, Substitutionally Disordered (SD), and Positionally Disordered (PD) crystals, and employs a flow matching model to jointly generate all structural components. A key innovation is a Riemannian flow matching framework with spherical reparameterization, which ensures physically valid disorder weights on the probability simplex. The vector field is learned by a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) that incorporates physical symmetries and a specialized message-passing scheme. Finally, a two-stage discretization procedure converts the continuous weights into multi-hot atomic assignments. To support research in this area, we release a benchmark containing SD, PD, and mixed structures curated from the Crystallography Open Database. Experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and De Novo Generation (DNG) tasks demonstrate that DMFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines adapted from ordered crystal generation. We hope our work provides a foundation for the AI-driven discovery of disordered materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion-Based Model-Level Explanation of Heterogeneous GNNs with Node Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08458v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction. Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features (e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space, whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WWW 2026.
