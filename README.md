| **[Real-Time Personalized Content Adaptation through Matrix Factorization and Context-Aware Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18489v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our study presents a multifaceted approach to enhancing user interaction and content relevance in social media platforms through a federated learning framework. We introduce personalized LLM Federated Learning and Context-based Social Media models. In our framework, multiple client entities receive a foundational GPT model, which is fine-tuned using locally collected social media data while ensuring data privacy through federated aggregation. Key modules focus on categorizing user-generated content, computing user persona scores, and identifying relevant posts from friends networks. By integrating a sophisticated social engagement quantification method with matrix factorization techniques, our system delivers real-time personalized content suggestions tailored to individual preferences. Furthermore, an adaptive feedback loop, alongside a robust readability scoring algorithm, significantly enhances the quality and relevance of the content presented to users. This comprehensive solution not only addresses the challenges of content filtering and recommendation but also fosters a more engaging social media experience while safeguarding user privacy, setting a new standard for personalized interactions in digital platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[TBGRecall: A Generative Retrieval Model for E-commerce Recommendation Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11977v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems are essential tools in modern e-commerce, facilitating personalized user experiences by suggesting relevant products. Recent advancements in generative models have demonstrated potential in enhancing recommendation systems; however, these models often exhibit limitations in optimizing retrieval tasks, primarily due to their reliance on autoregressive generation mechanisms. Conventional approaches introduce sequential dependencies that impede efficient retrieval, as they are inherently unsuitable for generating multiple items without positional constraints within a single request session. To address these limitations, we propose TBGRecall, a framework integrating Next Session Prediction (NSP), designed to enhance generative retrieval models for e-commerce applications. Our framework reformulation involves partitioning input samples into multi-session sequences, where each sequence comprises a session token followed by a set of item tokens, and then further incorporate multiple optimizations tailored to the generative task in retrieval scenarios. In terms of training methodology, our pipeline integrates limited historical data pre-training with stochastic partial incremental training, significantly improving training efficiency and emphasizing the superiority of data recency over sheer data volume. Our extensive experiments, conducted on public benchmarks alongside a large-scale industrial dataset from TaoBao, show TBGRecall outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation methods, and exhibits a clear scaling law trend. Ultimately, NSP represents a significant advancement in the effectiveness of generative recommendation systems for e-commerce applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Both ...</summary><p>Both authors contributed equally to this research.

| **[Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering: Orchestrating Users and Items for Agentic Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18413v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic recommendations cast recommenders as large language model (LLM) agents that can plan, reason, use tools, and interact with users of varying preferences in web applications. However, most existing agentic recommender systems focus on generic single-agent plan-execute workflows or multi-agent task decomposition pipelines. Without recommendation-oriented design, they often underuse the collaborative signals in the user-item interaction history, leading to unsatisfying recommendation results. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework for agentic recommendations, drawing an analogy between traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, given a target user and query, we instantiate similar users and relevant items as LLM agents with unique profiles. Each agent is able to call retrieval tools, suggest candidate items, and interact with other agents. Different from the static preference aggregation in traditional collaborative filtering, MACF employs a central orchestrator agent to adaptively manage the collaboration between user and item agents via dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instruction. Experimental results on datasets from three different domains show the advantages of our MACF framework compared to strong agentic recommendation baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach introduces item-side unfairness. Existing studies primarily attribute this issue to the absence of fairness constraints during SFT and attempt to mitigate unfairness via re-weighting and re-ranking methods. In this paper, we find that unfairness arises not only from SFT but also from pre-training, where inherent biases are further amplified during SFT. This finding underscores the failure of current methods to address the root causes of unfairness. Moreover, current methods struggle to preserve satisfactory recommendation performance. To tackle these issues, we propose an Unfair-to-Fair evOlving (UFO) framework using a self-play mechanism, formulating unfairness mitigation as a two-player game. UFO alternates between two player roles: the \textit{judger}, which identifies unfairness from both pre-training and SFT, and the \textit{corrector}, which adjusts the LRS to address identified unfairness while preserving recommendation performance. Iterative optimization between these roles enables UFO to completely resolve unfairness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UFO effectively mitigates unfairness while improving recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynamiX: Dynamic Resource eXploration for Personalized Ad-Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18331v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For online ad-recommendation systems, processing complete user-ad-engagement histories is both computationally intensive and noise-prone. We introduce Dynamix, a scalable, personalized sequence exploration framework that optimizes event history processing using maximum relevance principles and self-supervised learning through Event Based Features (EBFs). Dynamix categorizes users-engagements at session and surface-levels by leveraging correlations between dwell-times and ad-conversion events. This enables targeted, event-level feature removal and selective feature boosting for certain user-segments, thereby yielding training and inference efficiency wins without sacrificing engaging ad-prediction accuracy. While, dynamic resource removal increases training and inference throughput by 1.15% and 1.8%, respectively, dynamic feature boosting provides 0.033 NE gains while boosting inference QPS by 4.2% over baseline models. These results demonstrate that Dynamix achieves significant cost efficiency and performance improvements in online user-sequence based recommendation models. Self-supervised user-segmentation and resource exploration can further boost complex feature selection strategies while optimizing for workflow and compute resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 Tables, 5 images. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=oglD54lvcB</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Model Enhanced Graph Invariant Contrastive Learning for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18282v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has emerged as a significant challenge in graph recommender systems. Traditional graph neural network algorithms often fail because they learn spurious environmental correlations instead of stable causal relationships, leading to substantial performance degradation under distribution shifts. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue due to their vast world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, effectively integrating this knowledge with the fine-grained topology of specific graphs to solve the OOD problem remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose {$\textbf{Inv}$ariant $\textbf{G}$raph $\textbf{C}$ontrastive Learning with $\textbf{LLM}$s for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation (InvGCLLM)}, an innovative causal learning framework that synergistically integrates the strengths of data-driven models and knowledge-driven LLMs. Our framework first employs a data-driven invariant learning model to generate causal confidence scores for each user-item interaction. These scores then guide an LLM to perform targeted graph refinement, leveraging its world knowledge to prune spurious connections and augment missing causal links. Finally, the structurally purified graphs provide robust supervision for a causality-guided contrastive learning objective, enabling the model to learn representations that are resilient to spurious correlations. Experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that InvGCLLM achieves significant improvements in out-of-distribution recommendation, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Democratic Recommendation with User and Item Representatives Produced by Graph Condensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18279v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The challenges associated with large-scale user-item interaction graphs have attracted increasing attention in graph-based recommendation systems, primarily due to computational inefficiencies and inadequate information propagation. Existing methods provide partial solutions but suffer from notable limitations: model-centric approaches, such as sampling and aggregation, often struggle with generalization, while data-centric techniques, including graph sparsification and coarsening, lead to information loss and ineffective handling of bipartite graph structures. Recent advances in graph condensation offer a promising direction by reducing graph size while preserving essential information, presenting a novel approach to mitigating these challenges. Inspired by the principles of democracy, we propose \textbf{DemoRec}, a framework that leverages graph condensation to generate user and item representatives for recommendation tasks. By constructing a compact interaction graph and clustering nodes with shared characteristics from the original graph, DemoRec significantly reduces graph size and computational complexity. Furthermore, it mitigates the over-reliance on high-order information, a critical challenge in large-scale bipartite graphs. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DemoRec, showcasing substantial improvements in recommendation performance, computational efficiency, and robustness compared to SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Reasoning for Cold-Start Item Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18261v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for improving recommendation systems through their inherent reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base. Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Agentic AI and Multi-Agent Systems in Smart Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18258v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The convergence of Agentic AI and MAS enables a new paradigm for intelligent decision making in SMS. Traditional MAS architectures emphasize distributed coordination and specialized autonomy, while recent advances in agentic AI driven by LLMs introduce higher order reasoning, planning, and tool orchestration capabilities. This paper presents a hybrid agentic AI and multi agent framework for a Prescriptive Maintenance use case, where LLM based agents provide strategic orchestration and adaptive reasoning, complemented by rule based and SLMs agents performing efficient, domain specific tasks on the edge. The proposed framework adopts a layered architecture that consists of perception, preprocessing, analytics, and optimization layers, coordinated through an LLM Planner Agent that manages workflow decisions and context retention. Specialized agents autonomously handle schema discovery, intelligent feature analysis, model selection, and prescriptive optimization, while a HITL interface ensures transparency and auditability of generated maintenance recommendations. This hybrid design supports dynamic model adaptation, cost efficient maintenance scheduling, and interpretable decision making. An initial proof of concept implementation is validated on two industrial manufacturing datasets. The developed framework is modular and extensible, supporting seamless integration of new agents or domain modules as capabilities evolve. The results demonstrate the system capability to automatically detect schema, adapt preprocessing pipelines, optimize model performance through adaptive intelligence, and generate actionable, prioritized maintenance recommendations. The framework shows promise in achieving improved robustness, scalability, and explainability for RxM in smart manufacturing, bridging the gap between high level agentic reasoning and low level autonomous execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Admit Optimally in an $M/M/k/k+N$ Queueing System with Unknown Service Rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02419v3)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by applications of the Erlang-B blocking model and the extended $M/M/k/k+N$ model that allows for some queueing, beyond communication networks to sizing and pricing in production, messaging, and app-based parking systems, we study admission control for such systems with unknown service rate. In our model, a dispatcher either admits every arrival into the system (when there is room) or blocks it. Every served job yields a fixed reward but incurs a per unit time holding cost which includes the waiting time in the queue to get service if there is any. We aim to design a dispatching policy that maximizes the long-term average reward by observing arrival times and system state at arrivals, a realistic decision-event driven sampling of such systems. The dispatcher observes neither service times nor departure epochs, which excludes the use of reward-based reinforcement learning approaches. We develop our learning-based dispatch scheme as a parametric learning problem a'la self-tuning adaptive control. In our problem, certainty equivalent control switches between always admit if room (explore infinitely often), and never admit (terminate learning), so at judiciously chosen times we avoid the never admit recommendation. We prove that our proposed policy asymptotically converges to the optimal policy and present finite-time regret guarantees. The extreme contrast in the control policies shows up in our regret bounds for different parameter regimes: constant in one versus logarithmic in another.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Fast: Real-Time IoT Intrusion Reasoning Using IDS and LLMs at the Edge Gateway](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18230v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the number of connected IoT devices continues to grow, securing these systems against cyber threats remains a major challenge, especially in environments with limited computational and energy resources. This paper presents an edge-centric Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework that integrates lightweight machine learning (ML) based IDS models with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to improve detection accuracy, semantic interpretability, and operational efficiency at the network edge. The system evaluates six ML-based IDS models: Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model on low-power edge gateways, achieving accuracy up to 98 percent under real-world cyberattacks. For anomaly detection, the system transmits a compact and secure telemetry snapshot (for example, CPU usage, memory usage, latency, and energy consumption) via low-bandwidth API calls to LLMs including GPT-4-turbo, DeepSeek V2, and LLaMA 3.5. These models use zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought reasoning to produce human-readable threat analyses and actionable mitigation recommendations. Evaluations across diverse attacks such as DoS, DDoS, brute force, and port scanning show that the system enhances interpretability while maintaining low latency (<1.5 s), minimal bandwidth usage (<1.2 kB per prompt), and energy efficiency (<75 J), demonstrating its practicality and scalability as an IDS solution for edge gateways.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Time Series Foundation Models with Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18191v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern web applications--from real-time content recommendation and dynamic pricing to CDN optimization--increasingly rely on time-series forecasting to deliver personalized experiences to billions of users. Large-scale Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in time-series forecasting but suffer from high computational costs, limiting their deployment in latency-sensitive web applications. To address this challenge, we propose a general inference acceleration framework that adapts speculative decoding to autoregressive time-series models. Our approach employs a smaller "draft" model to propose future time-series patches, which are then verified in parallel by a larger "target" model, reducing the number of sequential forward passes required. We address key technical challenges in adapting this technique from discrete language tokens to continuous time-series distributions, including the design of acceptance criteria for multivariate Gaussian patches and practical variants that balance efficiency with accuracy. Through experiments on time series forecasting benchmarks relevant to web applications, we demonstrate significant inference speedups while maintaining competitive accuracy. The framework requires no architectural modifications to existing foundation models, making it immediately applicable to accelerate deployed time-series forecasting systems. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/PranavSubbaraman/STRIDE</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[The Value of Personalized Recommendations: Evidence from Netflix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07280v3)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized recommendation systems shape much of user choice online, yet their targeted nature makes separating out the value of recommendation and the underlying goods challenging. We build a discrete choice model that embeds recommendation-induced utility, low-rank heterogeneity, and flexible state dependence and apply the model to viewership data at Netflix. We exploit idiosyncratic variation introduced by the recommendation algorithm to identify and separately value these components as well as to recover model-free diversion ratios that we can use to validate our structural model. We use the model to evaluate counterfactuals that quantify the incremental engagement generated by personalized recommendations. First, we show that replacing the current recommender system with a matrix factorization or popularity-based algorithm would lead to 4% and 12% reduction in engagement, respectively, and decreased consumption diversity. Second, most of the consumption increase from recommendations comes from effective targeting, not mechanical exposure, with the largest gains for mid-popularity goods (as opposed to broadly appealing or very niche goods).</p></details> |  |
| **[Incentivized Network Dynamics in Digital Job Recruitment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09698v3)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recruiting passive candidates, i.e., individuals not actively seeking jobs but open to compelling opportunities, remains one of the hardest challenges in digital recruitment. Motivated by a real collaboration with an industry partner, we introduce the Independent Halting Cascade (IHC) model: a simple but rich agent-based framework that couples network diffusion with the possibility of halting through job applications. Agents can either recommend vacancies to peers or apply themselves, and incentives increase the likelihood of recommendation, mobilizing otherwise passive candidates. The IHC bridges research on social network diffusion, coordinated task completion, and labor economics by modeling heterogeneous skills, job specificities, and network structures, including homophily. We derive analytical boundaries that characterize diffusion and failure regimes, and we show, through simulations, that the IHC reproduces the empirical chain-length distributions of Travers and Milgram, and of Dodds, with only coarse calibration. Across synthetic (ER, BA, homophilic) and real networks (SMS, e-mail, Twitter), the IHC achieves comparable or higher success rates than direct-recommendation baselines, while requiring fewer applicants. Our findings suggest that the IHC captures core mechanisms of coordinated task completion, offering both a theoretical contribution and a practical foundation for recruitment systems designed to reach and engage passive candidates.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages (16 main, 6 appendix), 10 figures (8 main, 2 appendix)</p></details> |
| **[Fidelity-Aware Recommendation Explanations via Stochastic Path Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18047v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explanation fidelity, which measures how accurately an explanation reflects a model's true reasoning, remains critically underexplored in recommender systems. We introduce SPINRec (Stochastic Path Integration for Neural Recommender Explanations), a model-agnostic approach that adapts path-integration techniques to the sparse and implicit nature of recommendation data. To overcome the limitations of prior methods, SPINRec employs stochastic baseline sampling: instead of integrating from a fixed or unrealistic baseline, it samples multiple plausible user profiles from the empirical data distribution and selects the most faithful attribution path. This design captures the influence of both observed and unobserved interactions, yielding more stable and personalized explanations. We conduct the most comprehensive fidelity evaluation to date across three models (MF, VAE, NCF), three datasets (ML1M, Yahoo! Music, Pinterest), and a suite of counterfactual metrics, including AUC-based perturbation curves and fixed-length diagnostics. SPINRec consistently outperforms all baselines, establishing a new benchmark for faithful explainability in recommendation. Code and evaluation tools are publicly available at https://github.com/DeltaLabTLV/SPINRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting Interaction-Aware Monosemantic Concepts in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18024v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method for extracting \emph{monosemantic} neurons, defined as latent dimensions that align with coherent and interpretable concepts, from user and item embeddings in recommender systems. Our approach employs a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to reveal semantic structure within pretrained representations. In contrast to work on language models, monosemanticity in recommendation must preserve the interactions between separate user and item embeddings. To achieve this, we introduce a \emph{prediction aware} training objective that backpropagates through a frozen recommender and aligns the learned latent structure with the model's user-item affinity predictions. The resulting neurons capture properties such as genre, popularity, and temporal trends, and support post hoc control operations including targeted filtering and content promotion without modifying the base model. Our method generalizes across different recommendation models and datasets, providing a practical tool for interpretable and controllable personalization. Code and evaluation resources are available at https://github.com/DeltaLabTLV/Monosemanticity4Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Save, Revisit, Retain: A Scalable Framework for Enhancing User Retention in Large-Scale Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18013v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User retention is a critical objective for online platforms like Pinterest, as it strengthens user loyalty and drives growth through repeated engagement. A key indicator of retention is revisitation, i.e., when users return to view previously saved content, a behavior often sparked by personalized recommendations and user satisfaction. However, modeling and optimizing revisitation poses significant challenges. One core difficulty is accurate attribution: it is often unclear which specific user actions or content exposures trigger a revisit, since many confounding factors (e.g., content quality, user interface, notifications, or even changing user intent) can influence return behavior. Additionally, the scale and timing of revisitations introduce further complexity; users may revisit content days or even weeks after their initial interaction, requiring the system to maintain and associate extensive historical records across millions of users and sessions. These complexities render existing methods insufficient for robustly capturing and optimizing long-term revisitation. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel, lightweight, and interpretable framework for modeling revisitation behavior and optimizing long-term user retention in Pinterest's search-based recommendation context. By defining a surrogate attribution process that links saves to subsequent revisitations, we reduce noise in the causal relationship between user actions and return visits. Our scalable event aggregation pipeline enables large-scale analysis of user revisitation patterns and enhances the ranking system's ability to surface items with high retention value. Deployed on Pinterest's Related Pins surface to serve 500+ million users, the framework led to a significant lift of 0.1% in active users without additional computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Aspect Cross-modal Quantization for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15122v2)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in recommender systems. This approach relies on quantized representations to discretize item features, modeling users' historical interactions as sequences of discrete tokens. Based on these tokenized sequences, GR predicts the next item by employing next-token prediction methods. The challenges of GR lie in constructing high-quality semantic identifiers (IDs) that are hierarchically organized, minimally conflicting, and conducive to effective generative model training. However, current approaches remain limited in their ability to harness multimodal information and to capture the deep and intricate interactions among diverse modalities, both of which are essential for learning high-quality semantic IDs and for effectively training GR models. To address this, we propose Multi-Aspect Cross-modal quantization for generative Recommendation (MACRec), which introduces multimodal information and incorporates it into both semantic ID learning and generative model training from different aspects. Specifically, we first introduce cross-modal quantization during the ID learning process, which effectively reduces conflict rates and thus improves codebook usability through the complementary integration of multimodal information. In addition, to further enhance the generative ability of our GR model, we incorporate multi-aspect cross-modal alignments, including the implicit and explicit alignments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three well-known recommendation datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Three-Class Emotion Classification for Audiovisual Scenes Based on Ensemble Learning Scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17926v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotion recognition plays a pivotal role in enhancing human-computer interaction, particularly in movie recommendation systems where understanding emotional content is essential. While multimodal approaches combining audio and video have demonstrated effectiveness, their reliance on high-performance graphical computing limits deployment on resource-constrained devices such as personal computers or home audiovisual systems. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel audio-only ensemble learning framework capable of classifying movie scenes into three emotional categories: Good, Neutral, and Bad. The model integrates ten support vector machines and six neural networks within a stacking ensemble architecture to enhance classification performance. A tailored data preprocessing pipeline, including feature extraction, outlier handling, and feature engineering, is designed to optimize emotional information from audio inputs. Experiments on a simulated dataset achieve 67% accuracy, while a real-world dataset collected from 15 diverse films yields an impressive 86% accuracy. These results underscore the potential of audio-based, lightweight emotion recognition methods for broader consumer-level applications, offering both computational efficiency and robust classification capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Token-Controlled Re-ranking for Sequential Recommendation via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17913v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as re-rankers is shifting recommender systems towards a user-centric paradigm. However, a significant gap remains: current re-rankers often lack mechanisms for fine-grained user control. They struggle to balance inherent user preferences with multiple attribute-based constraints, often resorting to simplistic hard filtering that can excessively narrow the recommendation pool and yield suboptimal results. This limitation leaves users as passive recipients rather than active collaborators in the recommendation process. To bridge this gap, we propose COREC, a novel token-augmented re-ranking framework that incorporates specific user requirements in co-creating the recommendation outcome. COREC empowers users to steer re-ranking results with precise and flexible control via explicit, attribute-based signals. The framework learns to balance these commands against latent preferences, yielding rankings that adhere to user instructions without sacrificing personalization. Experiments show that COREC: (1) exceeds state-of-the-art baselines on standard recommendation effectiveness and (2) demonstrates superior adherence to specific attribute requirements, proving that COREC enables fine-grained and predictable manipulation of the rankings.</p></details> |  |

The course engaged students with a range of AI modalities such as symbolic composition, voice synthesis, timbre transfer, neural audio synthesis, and text-to-audio systems, combining theoretical reflection with practice-based experimentation. Its central pedagogical move is a paired-études design: each modality is approached first through its intended affordances and then through a deliberately reframed or "misused" exercise that surfaces representational limits and alternative behaviours. Framed by medium theory and post-structuralist inquiry, we treated AI as a transmodal conduit-a system that translates and perturbs musical signs across textual, symbolic, timbral and audio domains. Evidence from student work and reflection indicates growth in technical fluency, medium awareness, and critical literacy, alongside the cultivation of experimental method and process-oriented listening. The paper outlines the course architecture, assessment design, and representative projects, and distils a set of design patterns for AI-music pedagogy (eg., prompt-conditioned interplays and semantic destabilisation in text-to-audio; latent space materialism in timbre transfer). It concludes with pedagogical recommendations that integrate creative practice with medium awareness and with cultural-epistemic analysis of AI technologies, preparing students to participate in how AI is understood, developed, and deployed with creative communities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the Curse of Knowledge: Towards Effective Multimodal Recommendation using Knowledge Soft Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07419v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical challenge in contemporary recommendation systems lies in effectively leveraging multimodal content to enhance recommendation personalization. Although various solutions have been proposed, most fail to account for discrepancies between knowledge extracted through isolated feature extraction and its application in recommendation tasks. Specifically, multimodal feature extraction does not incorporate task-specific prior knowledge, while downstream recommendation tasks typically use these features as auxiliary information. This misalignment often introduces biases in model fitting and degrades performance, a phenomenon we refer to as the curse of knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose a knowledge soft integration framework designed to balance the utilization of multimodal features with the biases they may introduce. The framework, named Knowledge Soft Integration (KSI), comprises two key components: the Structure Efficient Injection (SEI) module and the Semantic Soft Integration (SSI) module. The SEI module employs a Refined Graph Neural Network (RGNN) to model inter-modal correlations among items while introducing a regularization term to minimize redundancy in user and item representations. In parallel, the SSI module utilizes a self-supervised retrieval task to implicitly integrate multimodal semantic knowledge, thereby enhancing the semantic distinctiveness of item representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating KSI's effectiveness. Furthermore, these results underscore the ability of the SEI and SSI modules to reduce representation redundancy and mitigate the curse of knowledge in multimodal recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |
| **[Social-Media Based Personas Challenge: Hybrid Prediction of Common and Rare User Actions on Bluesky](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17241v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting user behavior on social media platforms is crucial for content recommendation and platform design. While existing approaches focus primarily on common actions like retweeting and liking, the prediction of rare but significant behaviors remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a hybrid methodology for social media user behavior prediction that addresses both frequent and infrequent actions across a diverse action vocabulary. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale Bluesky dataset containing 6.4 million conversation threads spanning 12 distinct user actions across 25 persona clusters. Our methodology combines four complementary approaches: (i) a lookup database system based on historical response patterns; (ii) persona-specific LightGBM models with engineered temporal and semantic features for common actions; (iii) a specialized hybrid neural architecture fusing textual and temporal representations for rare action classification; and (iv) generation of text replies. Our persona-specific models achieve an average macro F1-score of 0.64 for common action prediction, while our rare action classifier achieves 0.56 macro F1-score across 10 rare actions.

| **[A neural recommender system leveraging transfer learning for property prediction of ionic liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10273v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as versatile replacements for traditional solvents because their physicochemical properties can be precisely tailored to various applications. However, accurately predicting key thermophysical properties remains challenging due to the vast chemical design space and the limited availability of experimental data. In this study, we present a data-driven transfer learning framework combined with a neural recommender system (NRS) to enable reliable property prediction for ILs using sparse experimental datasets. The approach involves a two-stage process: first, pre-training NRS models on COSMO-RS-based simulated data at fixed temperature and pressure, and second, fine-tuning simple feedforward neural networks with experimental data at varying temperatures and pressures. In this work, five essential IL properties are considered: density, viscosity, surface tension, heat capacity, and melting point. We find that the framework supports both within-property and cross-property knowledge transfer. Notably, pre-trained models for density, viscosity, and heat capacity are used to fine-tune models for all five target properties, achieving improved performance by a substantial margin for four of them. The model exhibits robust extrapolation to previously unseen ILs. Moreover, the final trained models enable property prediction for over 700,000 IL combinations, offering a scalable solution for IL screening in process design. This work highlights the effectiveness of combining simulated data and transfer learning to overcome sparsity in the experimental data.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPR: Towards a Generative Pre-trained One-Model Paradigm for Large-Scale Advertising Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10138v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an intelligent infrastructure connecting users with commercial content, advertising recommendation systems play a central role in information flow and value creation within the digital economy. However, existing multi-stage advertising recommendation systems suffer from objective misalignment and error propagation, making it difficult to achieve global optimality, while unified generative recommendation models still struggle to meet the demands of practical industrial applications. To address these issues, we propose GPR (Generative Pre-trained Recommender), the first one-model framework that redefines advertising recommendation as an end-to-end generative task, replacing the traditional cascading paradigm with a unified generative approach. To realize GPR, we introduce three key innovations spanning unified representation, network architecture, and training strategy. First, we design a unified input schema and tokenization method tailored to advertising scenarios, mapping both ads and organic content into a shared multi-level semantic ID space, thereby enhancing semantic alignment and modeling consistency across heterogeneous data. Second, we develop the Heterogeneous Hierarchical Decoder (HHD), a dual-decoder architecture that decouples user intent modeling from ad generation, achieving a balance between training efficiency and inference flexibility while maintaining strong modeling capacity. Finally, we propose a multi-stage joint training strategy that integrates Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), Value-Aware Fine-Tuning and the Hierarchy Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO) algorithm, forming a complete generative recommendation pipeline that unifies interest modeling, value alignment, and policy optimization. GPR has been fully deployed in the Tencent Weixin Channels advertising system, delivering significant improvements in key business metrics including GMV and CTCVR.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Generalization Bounds for Semi-supervised Matrix Completion with Distributional Side Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13049v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a matrix completion problem where both the ground truth $R$ matrix and the unknown sampling distribution $P$ over observed entries are low-rank matrices, and \textit{share a common subspace}. We assume that a large amount $M$ of \textit{unlabeled} data drawn from the sampling distribution $P$ is available, together with a small amount $N$ of labeled data drawn from the same distribution and noisy estimates of the corresponding ground truth entries. This setting is inspired by recommender systems scenarios where the unlabeled data corresponds to `implicit feedback' (consisting in interactions such as purchase, click, etc. ) and the labeled data corresponds to the `explicit feedback', consisting of interactions where the user has given an explicit rating to the item. Leveraging powerful results from the theory of low-rank subspace recovery, together with classic generalization bounds for matrix completion models, we show error bounds consisting of a sum of two error terms scaling as $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{nd}{M}}\right)$ and $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{dr}{N}}\right)$ respectively, where $d$ is the rank of $P$ and $r$ is the rank of $M$. In synthetic experiments, we confirm that the true generalization error naturally splits into independent error terms corresponding to the estimations of $P$ and and the ground truth matrix $\ground$ respectively. In real-life experiments on Douban and MovieLens with most explicit ratings removed, we demonstrate that the method can outperform baselines relying only on the explicit ratings, demonstrating that our assumptions provide a valid toy theoretical setting to study the interaction between explicit and implicit feedbacks in recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396v4)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[RASTP: Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning for Generative Recommendation with Semantic Identifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16943v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation systems typically leverage Semantic Identifiers (SIDs), which represent each item as a sequence of tokens that encode semantic information. However, representing item ID with multiple SIDs significantly increases input sequence length, which is a major determinant of computational complexity and memory consumption. While existing efforts primarily focus on optimizing attention computation and KV cache, we propose RASTP (Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning), which directly prunes less informative tokens in the input sequence. Specifically, RASTP evaluates token importance by combining semantic saliency, measured via representation magnitude, and attention centrality, derived from cumulative attention weights. Since RASTP dynamically prunes low-information or irrelevant semantic tokens, experiments on three real-world Amazon datasets show that RASTP reduces training time by 26.7\%, while maintaining or slightly improving recommendation performance. The code has been open-sourced at https://github.com/Yuzt-zju/RASTP.</p></details> | 4 pages |
| **[δ-EMG: A Monotonic Graph Index for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16921v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in high-dimensional spaces is a foundational component of many modern retrieval and recommendation systems. Currently, almost all algorithms follow an $ε$-Recall-Bounded principle when comparing performance: they require the ANN search results to achieve a recall of more than $1-ε$ and then compare query-per-second (QPS) performance. However, this approach only accounts for the recall of true positive results and does not provide guarantees on the deviation of incorrect results. To address this limitation, we focus on an Error-Bounded ANN method, which ensures that the returned results are a $(1/δ)$-approximation of the true values. Our approach adopts a graph-based framework. To enable Error-Bounded ANN search, we propose a $δ$-EMG (Error-bounded Monotonic Graph), which, for the first time, provides a provable approximation for arbitrary queries. By enforcing a $δ$-monotonic geometric constraint during graph construction, $δ$-EMG ensures that any greedy search converges to a $(1/δ)$-approximate neighbor without backtracking. Building on this foundation, we design an error-bounded top-$k$ ANN search algorithm that adaptively controls approximation accuracy during query time. To make the framework practical at scale, we introduce $δ$-EMQG (Error-bounded Monotonic Quantized Graph), a localized and degree-balanced variant with near-linear construction complexity. We further integrate vector quantization to accelerate distance computation while preserving theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments on the ANN-Benchmarks dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Under a recall requirement of 0.99, our algorithm achieves 19,000 QPS on the SIFT1M dataset, outperforming other methods by more than 40\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMInit: A Free Lunch from Large Language Models for Selective Initialization of Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01814v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely adopted in industrial recommender systems (RecSys) for modeling user-item interactions across numerous applications, but often struggles with cold-start and data-sparse scenarios. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with rich semantic knowledge, offer promising solutions to these challenges. However, deploying LLMs at scale is hindered by their significant computational demands and latency. In this paper, we propose a novel and scalable LLM-RecSys framework, LLMInit, designed to integrate pretrained LLM embeddings into CF models through selective initialization strategies. Specifically, we identify the embedding collapse issue observed when CF models scale and match the large embedding sizes in LLMs and avoid the problem by introducing efficient sampling methods, including, random, uniform, and variance-based selections. Comprehensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMInit significantly improves recommendation performance while maintaining low computational costs, offering a practical and scalable solution for industrial applications. To facilitate industry adoption and promote future research, we provide open-source access to our implementation at https://github.com/DavidZWZ/LLMInit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMNLP 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[The Oracle and The Prism: A Decoupled and Efficient Framework for Generative Recommendation Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16543v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into explainable recommendation systems often leads to a performance-efficiency trade-off in end-to-end architectures, where joint optimization of ranking and explanation can result in suboptimal compromises. To resolve this, we propose Prism, a novel decoupled framework that rigorously separates the recommendation process into a dedicated ranking stage and an explanation generation stage. Inspired by knowledge distillation, Prism leverages a powerful teacher LLM (e.g., FLAN-T5-XXL) as an Oracle to produce high-fidelity explanatory knowledge. A compact, fine-tuned student model (e.g., BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference. These results validate that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality explainable recommendation.</p></details> | 11 pages,3 figures |
| **[Music Recommendation with Large Language Models: Challenges, Opportunities, and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16478v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Music Recommender Systems (MRS) have long relied on an information-retrieval framing, where progress is measured mainly through accuracy on retrieval-oriented subtasks. While effective, this reductionist paradigm struggles to address the deeper question of what makes a good recommendation, and attempts to broaden evaluation, through user studies or fairness analyses, have had limited impact. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) disrupts this framework: LLMs are generative rather than ranking-based, making standard accuracy metrics questionable. They also introduce challenges such as hallucinations, knowledge cutoffs, non-determinism, and opaque training data, rendering traditional train/test protocols difficult to interpret. At the same time, LLMs create new opportunities, enabling natural-language interaction and even allowing models to act as evaluators. This work argues that the shift toward LLM-driven MRS requires rethinking evaluation. We first review how LLMs reshape user modeling, item modeling, and natural-language recommendation in music. We then examine evaluation practices from NLP, highlighting methodologies and open challenges relevant to MRS. Finally, we synthesize insights-focusing on how LLM prompting applies to MRS, to outline a structured set of success and risk dimensions. Our goal is to provide the MRS community with an updated, pedagogical, and cross-disciplinary perspective on evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review with the ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (TORS)</p></details> |
| **[Faster and Memory-Efficient Training of Sequential Recommendation Models for Large Catalogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09682v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendations (SR) with transformer-based architectures are widely adopted in real-world applications, where SR models require frequent retraining to adapt to ever-changing user preferences. However, training transformer-based SR models often encounters a high computational cost associated with scoring extensive item catalogs, often exceeding thousands of items. This occurs mainly due to the use of cross-entropy loss, where peak memory scales proportionally to catalog size, batch size, and sequence length. Recognizing this, practitioners in the field of recommendation systems typically address memory consumption by integrating the cross-entropy (CE) loss with negative sampling, thereby reducing the explicit memory demands of the final layer. However, a small number of negative samples would degrade model performance, and as we demonstrate in our work, increasing the number of negative samples and the batch size further improves the model's performance, but rapidly starts to exceed industrial GPUs' size (~40Gb). In this work, we introduce the CCE- method, which offers a GPU-efficient implementation of the CE loss with negative sampling. Our method accelerates training by up to two times while reducing memory consumption by more than 10 times. Leveraging the memory savings afforded by using CCE- for model training, it becomes feasible to enhance its accuracy on datasets with a large item catalog compared to those trained with original PyTorch-implemented loss functions. Finally, we perform an analysis of key memory-related hyperparameters and highlight the necessity of a delicate balance among these factors. We demonstrate that scaling both the number of negative samples and batch size leads to better results rather than maximizing only one of them. To facilitate further adoption of CCE-, we release a Triton kernel that efficiently implements the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient LLM-based Evolutional Recommendation with Locate-Forget-Update Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16414v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in sequential recommendations, and the adoption of LLM-based recommender systems (LLMRec) is becoming increasingly widespread in existing e-commerce platforms. Despite the impressive performance, the constant high volume of new user-item interactions makes it difficult to adapt to the evolution of user preference over time, especially for LLM-based recommender systems. The challenge arises from the large number of parameters in LLMs, which makes traditional evolution methods (i.e., Re-training or Fine-tuning) impractical. Specifically, Re-training with all interactions results in prohibitively high computational costs. On the other hand, fine-tuning with only new interactions leads to preference forgetting among inactive users, ultimately compromising overall performance. To tackle this problem, we propose EvoRec, an efficient Locate-Forget-Update framework designed for LLM-based recommender systems to model the evolution of user preferences. EvoRec identifies a small set of parameters associated with preference changes and updates them precisely, thereby saving computational resources while maintaining strong recommendation performance. Notably, the modified parameters account for only 30\% of LoRA adapter parameters, with no additional parameters introduced. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, EvoRec not only efficiently evolves LLMRec to adapt to the preferences of active users, but also preserves the interests of inactive users from being disturbed during evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Agent Reasoning Across Independent Systems With Strict Data Locality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16292v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries. The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation. The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |

Predictive maintenance systems powered by supervised machine learning offer a promising approach by detecting failures before they occur, reducing unscheduled downtime, and improving operational efficiency. However, the success of such systems depends on high quality labeled data, necessitating user centered labeling interfaces tailored to annotators needs for Usability and User Experience. This study introduces a cost effective predictive maintenance system developed in the federally funded project DigiOnTrack, which combines structure borne noise measurement with supervised learning to provide monitoring and maintenance recommendations for rail vehicles and infrastructure in rural Germany. The system integrates wireless sensor networks, distributed ledger technology for secure data transfer, and a dockerized container infrastructure hosting the labeling interface and dashboard. Train drivers and workshop foremen labeled faults on infrastructure and vehicles to ensure accurate recommendations. The Usability and User Experience evaluation showed that the locomotive drivers interface achieved Excellent Usability, while the workshop foremans interface was rated as Good. These results highlight the systems potential for integration into daily workflows, particularly in labeling efficiency. However, areas such as Perspicuity require further optimization for more data intensive scenarios. The findings offer insights into the design of predictive maintenance systems and labeling interfaces, providing a foundation for future guidelines in Industry 4.0 applications, particularly in rail transportation.</p></details> |  |

While enabling powerful new capabilities, these systems also introduce unique forms of uncertainty stemming from probabilistic reasoning, evolving memory states, and fluid execution paths. Traditional software observability and operations practices fall short in addressing these challenges. This paper presents our vision of AgentOps: a comprehensive framework for observing, analyzing, optimizing, and automating operation of agentic AI systems. We identify distinct needs across four key roles - developers, testers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and business users - each of whom engages with the system at different points in its lifecycle. We present the AgentOps Automation Pipeline, a six-stage process encompassing behavior observation, metric collection, issue detection, root cause analysis, optimized recommendations, and runtime automation. Throughout, we emphasize the critical role of automation in managing uncertainty and enabling self-improving AI systems - not by eliminating uncertainty, but by taming it to ensure safe, adaptive, and effective operation.</p></details> |  |

| **[AIF: Asynchronous Inference Framework for Cost-Effective Pre-Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12934v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In industrial recommendation systems, pre-ranking models based on deep neural networks (DNNs) commonly adopt a sequential execution framework: feature fetching and model forward computation are triggered only after receiving candidates from the upstream retrieval stage. This design introduces inherent bottlenecks, including redundant computations of identical users/items and increased latency due to strictly sequential operations, which jointly constrain the model's capacity and system efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the Asynchronous Inference Framework (AIF), a cost-effective computational architecture that decouples interaction-independent components, those operating within a single user or item, from real-time prediction. AIF reorganizes the model inference process by performing user-side computations in parallel with the retrieval stage and conducting item-side computations in a nearline manner. This means that interaction-independent components are calculated just once and completed before the real-time prediction phase of the pre-ranking stage. As a result, AIF enhances computational efficiency and reduces latency, freeing up resources to significantly improve the feature set and model architecture of interaction-independent components. Moreover, we delve into model design within the AIF framework, employing approximated methods for interaction-dependent components in online real-time predictions. By co-designing both the framework and the model, our solution achieves notable performance gains without significantly increasing computational and latency costs. This has enabled the successful deployment of AIF in the Taobao display advertising system.</p></details> |  |

Although these requirements play a vital role in reducing bias and enhancing performance, their formulation and management remain underexplored, leading to inconsistencies, safety risks, and regulatory concerns. Our study investigates how annotation requirements are defined and used in practice, the challenges in ensuring their quality, practitioner-recommended improvements, and their impact on AIePS development and performance. We conducted $19$ semi-structured interviews with participants from six international companies and four research organisations. Our thematic analysis reveals five main key challenges: ambiguity, edge case complexity, evolving requirements, inconsistencies, and resource constraints and three main categories of best practices, including ensuring compliance with ethical standards, improving data annotation requirements guidelines, and embedded quality assurance for data annotation requirements. We also uncover critical interrelationships between annotation requirements, annotation practices, annotated data quality, and AIePS performance and development, showing how requirement flaws propagate through the AIePS development pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to offer empirically grounded guidance on improving annotation requirements, offering actionable insights to enhance annotation quality, regulatory compliance, and system reliability. It also contributes to the emerging fields of Software Engineering (SE for AI) and Requirements Engineering (RE for AI) by bridging the gap between RE and AI in a timely and much-needed manner.</p></details> |  |

This creates cognitive and interaction burdens that limit productivity. We introduce DuoZone, a mixed-initiative XR window management system that combines user-defined spatial layouts with LLM-guided automation. DuoZone separates window management into two complementary zones. The Recommendation Zone enables fast setup by providing spatial layout templates and automatically recommending relevant applications based on user tasks and high-level goals expressed through voice or text. The Arrangement Zone supports precise refinement through direct manipulation, allowing users to adjust windows using natural spatial actions such as dragging, resizing, and snapping. Through this dual-zone approach, DuoZone promotes efficient organization while reducing user cognitive load. We conducted a user study comparing DuoZone with a baseline manual XR window manager. Results show that DuoZone improves task completion speed, reduces mental effort, and increases sense of control when working with multiple applications in XR. We discuss design implications for future mixed-initiative systems and outline opportunities for integrating adaptive, goal-aware intelligence into spatial computing workflows.</p></details> |  |

However, most industrial systems adopt a self-reinforcing training pipeline that relies on historically exposed user interactions for supervision. This paradigm inevitably leads to a filter bubble effect, where potentially relevant but previously unseen content is excluded from the training signal, biasing the model toward narrow and conservative retrieval. In this paper, we present CroPS (Cross-Perspective Positive Samples), a novel retrieval data engine designed to alleviate this problem by introducing diverse and semantically meaningful positive examples from multiple perspectives. CroPS enhances training with positive signals derived from user query reformulation behavior (query-level), engagement data in recommendation streams (system-level), and world knowledge synthesized by large language models (knowledge-level). To effectively utilize these heterogeneous signals, we introduce a Hierarchical Label Assignment (HLA) strategy and a corresponding H-InfoNCE loss that together enable fine-grained, relevance-aware optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on Kuaishou Search, a large-scale commercial short-video search platform, demonstrate that CroPS significantly outperforms strong baselines both offline and in live A/B tests, achieving superior retrieval performance and reducing query reformulation rates. CroPS is now fully deployed in Kuaishou Search, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.</p></details> | AAAI-2026, Oral |

Sociopolitical polarization hinders such cooperation. Prior agent-based models showed polarization emerges naturally in structured social networks and polarized cluster dissolution rate limits consensus formation rate. Here we study how guided link rewiring affects depolarization dynamics across synthetic and empirical (Facebook, Twitter) network topologies. We compare heuristic rewiring algorithms representing random meetings, mutual acquaintance introductions, and community bridging, alongside topology-based link recommender algorithms (Who to Follow and node2vec). Our heuristic algorithms all outperform Who to Follow in generating cooperative consensus. Homophilic rewiring generates cooperative consensus when agents can easily change opinions. However, heterophilic rewiring achieves this over broader conditions and can accelerate cooperative consensus formation by ~20%, including where up to 33% of the population experiences backfiring interactions. Heterophilic rewiring also vastly outperforms topology-based recommender algorithms. Random rewiring performed consistently well, achieving higher steady-state cooperation than seven out of eight more complex algorithms. Large disparities in steady-state cooperation for topology-based recommender systems highlight their volatility across network structures. Overall, our work reveals a subtle interplay between topology, rewiring algorithm and social depolarization, suggesting strong potential for carefully redesigning social networking technologies for social good.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Combining LLM Semantic Reasoning with GNN Structural Modeling for Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08008v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view multi-label feature selection aims to identify informative features from heterogeneous views, where each sample is associated with multiple interdependent labels. This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph.

Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Multi-Agent LLM Orchestration Achieves Deterministic, High-Quality Decision Support for Incident Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15755v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. All code, Docker configurations, and trial data are publicly available for reproduction.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 tables |
| **[ItemRAG: Item-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation for LLM-Based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15141v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been widely used as recommender systems, owing to their strong reasoning capability and their effectiveness in handling cold-start items. To better adapt LLMs for recommendation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been incorporated. Most existing RAG methods are user-based, retrieving purchase patterns of users similar to the target user and providing them to the LLM. In this work, we propose ItemRAG, an item-based RAG method for LLM-based recommendation that retrieves relevant items (rather than users) from item-item co-purchase histories. ItemRAG helps LLMs capture co-purchase patterns among items, which are beneficial for recommendations. Especially, our retrieval strategy incorporates semantically similar items to better handle cold-start items and uses co-purchase frequencies to improve the relevance of the retrieved items. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ItemRAG consistently (1) improves the zero-shot LLM-based recommender by up to 43% in Hit-Ratio-1 and (2) outperforms user-based RAG baselines under both standard and cold-start item recommendation settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sync or Sink: Bounds on Algorithmic Collective Action with Noise and Multiple Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18933v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collective action against algorithmic systems provides an opportunity for a small group of individuals to strategically manipulate their data to get specific outcomes, from classification to recommendation models. This effectiveness will invite more growth of this type of coordinated actions, both in the size and the number of distinct collectives. With a small group, however, coordination is key. Currently, there is no formal analysis of how coordination challenges within a collective can impact downstream outcomes, or how multiple collectives may affect each other's success. In this work, we aim to provide guarantees on the success of collective action in the presence of both coordination noise and multiple groups. Our insight is that data generated by either multiple collectives or by coordination noise can be viewed as originating from multiple data distributions. Using this framing, we derive bounds on the success of collective action. We conduct experiments to study the effects of noise on collective action. We find that sufficiently high levels of noise can reduce the success of collective action. In certain scenarios, large noise can sink a collective success rate from $100\%$ to just under $60\%$. We identify potential trade-offs between collective size and coordination noise; for example, a collective that is twice as big but with four times more noise experiencing worse outcomes than the smaller, more coordinated one. This work highlights the importance of understanding nuanced dynamics of strategic behavior in algorithmic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated with feedback for NeurIPS workshop</p></details> |

This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for "agentic AI," with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Observation-Free Attacks on Online Learning to Rank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22855v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption, the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies: CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical results on real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harmful Traits of AI Companions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14972v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amid the growing prevalence of human -- AI interaction, large language models and other AI-based entities increasingly provide forms of companionship to human users. Such AI companionship -- i.e., bonded relationships between humans and AI systems that resemble the relationships people have with family members, friends, and romantic partners -- might substantially benefit humans. Yet such relationships can also do profound harm. We propose a framework for analyzing potential negative impacts of AI companionship by identifying specific harmful traits of AI companions and speculatively mapping causal pathways back from these traits to possible causes and forward to potential harmful effects. We provide detailed, structured analysis of four potentially harmful traits -- the absence of natural endpoints for relationships, vulnerability to product sunsetting, high attachment anxiety, and propensity to engender protectiveness -- and briefly discuss fourteen others. For each trait, we propose hypotheses connecting causes -- such as misaligned optimization objectives and the digital nature of AI companions -- to fundamental harms -- including reduced autonomy, diminished quality of human relationships, and deception. Each hypothesized causal connection identifies a target for potential empirical evaluation. Our analysis examines harms at three levels: to human partners directly, to their relationships with other humans, and to society broadly. We examine how existing law struggles to address these emerging harms, discuss potential benefits of AI companions, and conclude with design recommendations for mitigating risks. This analysis offers immediate suggestions for reducing risks while laying a foundation for deeper investigation of this critical but understudied topic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unobtrusive Monitoring of Simulated Physical Weakness Using Fine-Grained Behavioral Features and Personalized Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10045v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aging and chronic conditions affect older adults' daily lives, making early detection of developing health issues crucial. Weakness, common in many conditions, alters physical movements and daily activities subtly. However, detecting such changes can be challenging due to their subtle and gradual nature. To address this, we employ a non-intrusive camera sensor to monitor individuals' daily sitting and relaxing activities for signs of weakness. We simulate weakness in healthy subjects by having them perform physical exercise and observing the behavioral changes in their daily activities before and after workouts. The proposed system captures fine-grained features related to body motion, inactivity, and environmental context in real-time while prioritizing privacy. A Bayesian Network is used to model the relationships between features, activities, and health conditions. We aim to identify specific features and activities that indicate such changes and determine the most suitable time scale for observing the change. Results show 0.97 accuracy in distinguishing simulated weakness at the daily level. Fine-grained behavioral features, including non-dominant upper body motion speed and scale, and inactivity distribution, along with a 300-second window, are found most effective. However, individual-specific models are recommended as no universal set of optimal features and activities was identified across all participants.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Intelligent Fashion Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07573v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of online fashion platforms has created an increasing demand for intelligent recommender systems capable of understanding both visual and textual cues. This paper proposes a hybrid multimodal deep learning framework for fashion recommendation that jointly addresses two key tasks: outfit compatibility prediction and complementary item retrieval. The model leverages the visual and textual encoders of the CLIP architecture to obtain joint latent representations of fashion items, which are then integrated into a unified feature vector and processed by a transformer encoder. For compatibility prediction, an "outfit token" is introduced to model the holistic relationships among items, achieving an AUC of 0.95 on the Polyvore dataset. For complementary item retrieval, a "target item token" representing the desired item description is used to retrieve compatible items, reaching an accuracy of 69.24% under the Fill-in-the-Blank (FITB) metric. The proposed approach demonstrates strong performance across both tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal learning for fashion recommendation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |
| **[SilverTorch: A Unified Model-based System to Democratize Large-Scale Recommendation on GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14881v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serving deep learning based recommendation models (DLRM) at scale is challenging. Existing systems rely on CPU-based ANN indexing and filtering services, suffering from non-negligible costs and forgoing joint optimization opportunities. Such inefficiency makes them difficult to support more complex model architectures, such as learned similarities and multi-task retrieval. In this paper, we propose SilverTorch, a model-based system for serving recommendation models on GPUs. SilverTorch unifies model serving by replacing standalone indexing and filtering services with layers of served models. We propose a Bloom index algorithm on GPUs for feature filtering and a tensor-native fused Int8 ANN kernel on GPUs for nearest neighbor search. We further co-design the ANN search index and filtering index to reduce GPU memory utilization and eliminate unnecessary computation. Benefit from SilverTorch's serving paradigm, we introduce a OverArch scoring layer and a Value Model to aggregate results across multi-tasks. These advancements improve the accuracy for retrieval and enable future studies for serving more complex models. For ranking, SilverTorch's design accelerates item embedding calculation by caching the pre-calculated embeddings inside the serving model. Our evaluation on the industry-scale datasets show that SilverTorch achieves up to 5.6x lower latency and 23.7x higher throughput compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. We also demonstrate that SilverTorch's solution is 13.35x more cost-efficient than CPU-based solution while improving accuracy via serving more complex models. SilverTorch serves over hundreds of models online across major products and recommends contents for billions of daily active users.</p></details> |  |
| **[FinTRec: Transformer Based Unified Contextual Ads Targeting and Personalization for Financial Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14865v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based architectures are widely adopted in sequential recommendation systems, yet their application in Financial Services (FS) presents distinct practical and modeling challenges for real-time recommendation. These include:a) long-range user interactions (implicit and explicit) spanning both digital and physical channels generating temporally heterogeneous context, b) the presence of multiple interrelated products require coordinated models to support varied ad placements and personalized feeds, while balancing competing business goals. We propose FinTRec, a transformer-based framework that addresses these challenges and its operational objectives in FS. While tree-based models have traditionally been preferred in FS due to their explainability and alignment with regulatory requirements, our study demonstrate that FinTRec offers a viable and effective shift toward transformer-based architectures. Through historic simulation and live A/B test correlations, we show FinTRec consistently outperforms the production-grade tree-based baseline. The unified architecture, when fine-tuned for product adaptation, enables cross-product signal sharing, reduces training cost and technical debt, while improving offline performance across all products. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of unified sequential recommendation modeling in FS that addresses both technical and business considerations.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, Accepted at CARS @ RecSys 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cloud-Native Vector Search: A Comprehensive Performance Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14748v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector search has been widely employed in recommender system and retrieval-augmented-generation pipelines, commonly performed with vector indexes to efficiently find similar items in large datasets. Recent growths in both data and task complexity have motivated placing vector indexes onto remote storage -- cloud-native vector search, which cloud providers have recently introduced services for. Yet, despite varying workload characteristics and various available vector index forms, providers default to using cluster-based indexes, which on paper do adapt well to differences between disk and cloud-based environment: their fetch granularities and lack of notable intra-query dependencies aligns with the large optimal fetch sizes and minimizes costly round-trips (i.e., as opposed to graph-based indexes) to remote storage, respectively. This paper systematically studies cloud-native vector search: What and how should indexes be built and used for on-cloud vector search? We analyze bottlenecks of two common index classes, cluster and graph indexes, on remote storage, and show that despite current standardized adoption of cluster indexes on the cloud, graph indexes are favored in workloads requiring high concurrency and recall, or operating on high-dimensional data or large datatypes. We further find that on-cloud search demands significantly different indexing and search parameterizations versus on-disk search for optimal performance. Finally, we incorporate existing cloud-based caching setups into vector search and find that certain index optimizations work against caching, and study how this can be mitigated to maximize gains under various available cache sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Federated Recommendation With Knowledge Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12959v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Recommendation (FedRec) has emerged as a key paradigm for building privacy-preserving recommender systems. However, existing FedRec models face a critical dilemma: memory-efficient single-knowledge models suffer from a suboptimal knowledge replacement practice that discards valuable personalization, while high-performance dual-knowledge models are often too memory-intensive for practical on-device deployment. We propose Federated Recommendation with Knowledge Guidance (FedRKG), a model-agnostic framework that resolves this dilemma. The core principle, Knowledge Guidance, avoids full replacement and instead fuses global knowledge into preserved local embeddings, attaining the personalization benefits of dual-knowledge within a single-knowledge memory footprint. Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive Guidance, a fine-grained mechanism that dynamically modulates the intensity of this guidance for each user-item interaction, overcoming the limitations of static fusion methods. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedRKG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Carousels allow for highlighting different aspects of users' taste, that fall in categories such as genres and authors. However, while carousels offer structure and greater ease of navigation, they alone do not increase diversity in recommendations, while this is essential to keep users engaged. In this work we propose several approaches to effectively increase item diversity within the domain of book recommendations, on top of a collaborative filtering algorithm. These approaches are intended to improve book recommendations in the web catalogs of public libraries. Furthermore, we introduce metrics to evaluate the resulting strategies, and show that the proposed system finds a suitable balance between accuracy and beyond-accuracy aspects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at BNAIC/BeNeLearn 2025; The 37th Benelux Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the 34th Belgian Dutch Conference on Machine Learning</p></details> |

Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities to automate such evaluations. In this work, we explore the potential of multimodal LLMs to assess the usability of recommender system interfaces by considering a variety of publicly available systems as examples. We take user interface screenshots from multiple of these recommender platforms to cover both preference elicitation and recommendation presentation scenarios. An LLM is instructed to analyze these interfaces with regard to different usability criteria and provide explanatory feedback. Our evaluation demonstrates how LLMs can support heuristic-style usability assessments at scale to support the improvement of user experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was presented at IntRS'25: Joint Workshop on Interfaces and Human Decision Making for Recommender Systems, September 22, 2025, Prague, Czech Republic and is published in the workshop proceedings: https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-4027/</p></details> |

XAI enhances transparency and human oversight of AI systems, especially ''black-box`` models criticized as incomprehensible. Yet discourse about the AI Act's stakeholders and XAI remains disconnected: XAI increasingly prioritizes end users' needs, while the AI Act focuses on providers' and deployers' obligations. We aim to bridge this divide and offer practical guidance on their relationship. Through interdisciplinary discussion in a cross functional team of XAI, AI Act, legal, and requirements-engineering experts, we outline steps to analyze an AI-based clinical decision support system, clarify end-user needs, and assess AI Act applicability. Using an AI system under development as a case study, we show how XAI techniques can help reconcile stakeholder needs with AI Act requirements and fill gaps between usability and regulatory demands. We compare similarities and differences between legal obligations and end-user needs, identify tensions, and point to concrete design choices and trade-offs. We invite researchers and practitioners in XAI to reflect on their role relative to the AI Act and to develop mutual understanding across disciplines. While XAI can help implement core AI Act principles such as transparency and human oversight, it should be considered one element of a broader compliance strategy that also requires standardization, legal interpretation, documentation, organizational processes, governance, testing, and ongoing monitoring and auditing practices. Our findings yield actionable recommendations for integrating XAI into product development, compliance workflows, and stakeholder communication, informing policy-making and standards development.</p></details> | 18 pages, 2 figures |

In the era of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based recommender systems have emerged as a prevalent paradigm for advancing personalized recommendations. Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has drawn growing interest to facilitate the recommendation capability of LLMs, incorporating useful information retrieved from external knowledge bases. However, as a rich source of up-to-date information, the web remains under-explored by existing RAG-based recommendations. In particular, unique challenges are posed from two perspectives: one is to generate effective queries for web retrieval, considering the inherent knowledge gap between web search and recommendations; another challenge lies in harnessing online websites that contain substantial noisy content. To tackle these limitations, we propose WebRec, a novel web-based RAG framework, which takes advantage of the reasoning capability of LLMs to interpret recommendation tasks into queries of user preferences that cater to web retrieval. Moreover, given noisy web-retrieved information, where relevant pieces of evidence are scattered far apart, an insightful MP-Head is designed to enhance LLM attentions between distant tokens of relevant information via message passing. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed web-based RAG methods in recommendation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MindRec: A Diffusion-driven Coarse-to-Fine Paradigm for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12597v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language model-based recommendation systems often represent items as text or semantic IDs and generate recommendations in an auto-regressive manner. However, due to the left-to-right greedy decoding strategy and the unidirectional logical flow, such methods often fail to produce globally optimal recommendations. In contrast, human reasoning does not follow a rigid left-to-right sequence. Instead, it often begins with keywords or intuitive insights, which are then refined and expanded. Inspired by this fact, we propose MindRec, a diffusion-driven coarse-to-fine generative paradigm that emulates human thought processes. Built upon a diffusion language model, MindRec departs from auto-regressive generation by leveraging a masked diffusion process to reconstruct items in a flexible, non-sequential manner. Particularly, our method first generates key tokens that reflect user preferences, and then expands them into the complete item, enabling adaptive and human-like generation. To further emulate the structured nature of human decision-making, we organize items into a hierarchical category tree. This structure guides the model to first produce the coarse-grained category and then progressively refine its selection through finer-grained subcategories before generating the specific item. To mitigate the local optimum problem inherent in greedy decoding, we design a novel beam search algorithm, Diffusion Beam Search, tailored for our mind-inspired generation paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that MindRec yields a 9.5\% average improvement in top-1 accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential to enhance recommendation performance. The implementation is available via https://github.com/Mr-Peach0301/MindRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning Framework with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14120v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Yet, current-generation EMS infrastructure remains constrained by one-to-one video streaming and limited analytics capabilities, leaving dispatchers and EMTs to manually interpret overwhelming, often noisy or redundant information in high-stress environments. We present TeleEMS, a mobile live video analytics system that enables pre-arrival multimodal inference by fusing audio and video into a unified decision-making pipeline before EMTs arrive on scene. TeleEMS comprises two key components: TeleEMS Client and TeleEMS Server. The TeleEMS Client runs across phones, smart glasses, and desktops to support bystanders, EMTs en route, and 911 dispatchers. The TeleEMS Server, deployed at the edge, integrates EMS-Stream, a communication backbone that enables smooth multi-party video streaming. On top of EMSStream, the server hosts three real-time analytics modules: (1) audio-to-symptom analytics via EMSLlama, a domain-specialized LLM for robust symptom extraction and normalization; (2) video-to-vital analytics using state-of-the-art rPPG methods for heart rate estimation; and (3) joint text-vital analytics via PreNet, a multimodal multitask model predicting EMS protocols, medication types, medication quantities, and procedures. Evaluation shows that EMSLlama outperforms GPT-4o (exact-match 0.89 vs. 0.57) and that text-vital fusion improves inference robustness, enabling reliable pre-arrival intervention recommendations. TeleEMS demonstrates the potential of mobile live video analytics to transform EMS operations, bridging the gap between bystanders, dispatchers, and EMTs, and paving the way for next-generation intelligent EMS infrastructure.</p></details> |  |
| **[CafeMed: Causal Attention Fusion Enhanced Medication Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14064v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medication recommendation systems play a crucial role in assisting clinicians with personalized treatment decisions. While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations.

Existing attempts to address this often rely on costly paired preference data or introduce latency through Large Language Models. In this work, we introduce REBECA (REcommendations BEyond CAtalogs), a lightweight and scalable framework for personalized image generation that learns directly from implicit feedback signals such as likes, ratings, and clicks. Instead of fine-tuning the underlying diffusion model, REBECA employs a two-stage process: training a conditional diffusion model to sample user- and rating-specific image embeddings, which are subsequently decoded into images using a pretrained diffusion backbone. This approach enables efficient, fine-tuning-free personalization across large user bases. We rigorously evaluate REBECA on real-world datasets, proposing a novel statistical personalization verifier and a permutation-based hypothesis test to assess preference alignment. Our results demonstrate that REBECA consistently produces high-fidelity images tailored to individual tastes, outperforming baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In tandem, there has been an explosion of multidisciplinary research examining how NLP tasks reflect, perpetuate, and amplify social biases such as gender and racial bias. A significant gap in this scholarship is a detailed analysis of how queer sexualities are encoded and (mis)represented by both NLP systems and practitioners. Following previous work in the field of AI fairness, we document how sexuality is defined and operationalized via a survey and analysis of 55 articles that quantify sexuality-based NLP bias. We find that sexuality is not clearly defined in a majority of the literature surveyed, indicating a reliance on assumed or normative conceptions of sexual/romantic practices and identities. Further, we find that methods for extracting biased outputs from NLP technologies often conflate gender and sexual identities, leading to monolithic conceptions of queerness and thus improper quantifications of bias. With the goal of improving sexuality-based NLP bias analyses, we conclude with recommendations that encourage more thorough engagement with both queer communities and interdisciplinary literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 tables, 1 figure, undergraduate senior thesis, submitted to The Spectra: The Virginia Engineering and Science Research Journal</p></details> |

To address this, we propose the $(k,g,p)$-core model, which incorporates the relative importance of hyperedges for more accurate subgraph detection. We develop both Naïve and Advanced pruning algorithms, demonstrating through extensive experiments that our approach reduces the execution frequency of costly operations by 51.9% on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Grounded in contingency theory and quality theory, the study examines the role of P-AI fit in managerial decision-making through a proof-of-concept case study involving a real hiring process for a Senior AI Lead. Three decision pathways are compared: (1) independent evaluations by a CEO, CTO, and CSO; (2) an evaluation produced by an augmented human-AI symbiotic intelligence system (H3LIX-LAIZA); and (3) an assessment generated by a general-purpose large language model. The results reveal substantial role-based divergence in human judgments, high alignment between H3LIX-LAIZA and the CEOs implicit decision model-including ethical disqualification of a high-risk candidate and a critical false-positive recommendation from the LLMr. The findings demonstrate that higher P-AI fit, exemplified by the CEO H3LIX-LAIZA relationship, functions as a mechanism linking augmented symbiotic intelligence to accurate, trustworthy, and context-sensitive decisions. The study provides an initial verification of the P-AI fit construct and a proof-of-concept for H3LIX-LAIZA as an augmented human-AI symbiotic intelligence system.</p></details> | 30 pages, 2 figures |

This paper presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of two prominent open-source LLM serving frameworks: vLLM and HuggingFace Text Generation Inference (TGI). We benchmark these systems across multiple dimensions including throughput performance, end-to-end latency, GPU memory utilization, and scalability characteristics using LLaMA-2 models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters. Our experiments reveal that vLLM achieves up to 24x higher throughput than TGI under high-concurrency workloads through its novel PagedAttention mechanism, while TGI demonstrates lower tail latencies for interactive single-user scenarios. We provide detailed performance profiles for different deployment scenarios and offer practical recommendations for system selection based on workload characteristics. Our findings indicate that the choice between these frameworks should be guided by specific use-case requirements: vLLM excels in high-throughput batch processing scenarios, while TGI is better suited for latency-sensitive interactive applications with moderate concurrency.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, benchmarking study of LLM inference systems</p></details> |

We present KUL-Rec, a biologically inspired ER system that couples a fast Hebbian memory with slow replay-based consolidation to enable continual, few-shot personalization from sparse interactions. The model operates in an embedding space, allowing a single architecture to handle both tabular knowledge-tracing logs and open-ended short-answer text. We align evaluation with tutoring needs using bidirectional ranking and rank-sensitive metrics (nDCG, Recall@K). Across ten public datasets, KUL-Rec improves macro nDCG (0.316 vs. 0.265 for the strongest baseline) and Recall@10 (0.305 vs. 0.211), while achieving low inference latency and an $\approx99$\% reduction in peak GPU memory relative to a competitive graph-based model. In a 13-week graduate course, KUL-Rec personalized weekly short-answer quizzes generated by a retrieval-augmented pipeline and the personalized quizzes were associated with lower perceived difficulty and higher helpfulness (p < .05). An embedding robustness audit highlights that encoder choice affects semantic alignment, motivating routine audits when deploying open-response assessment. Together, these results indicate that Hebbian replay with bounded consolidation offers a practical path to real-time, interpretable ER that scales across data modalities and classroom settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEMUR: Large scale End-to-end MUltimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10962v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional ID-based recommender systems often struggle with cold-start and generalization challenges. Multimodal recommendation systems, which leverage textual and visual data, offer a promising solution to mitigate these issues. However, existing industrial approaches typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm: first pretraining a multimodal model, then applying its frozen representations to train the recommendation model. This decoupled framework suffers from misalignment between multimodal learning and recommendation objectives, as well as an inability to adapt dynamically to new data. To address these limitations, we propose LEMUR, the first large-scale multimodal recommender system trained end-to-end from raw data. By jointly optimizing both the multimodal and recommendation components, LEMUR ensures tighter alignment with downstream objectives while enabling real-time parameter updates. Constructing multimodal sequential representations from user history often entails prohibitively high computational costs. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose a novel memory bank mechanism that incrementally accumulates historical multimodal representations throughout the training process. After one month of deployment in Douyin Search, LEMUR has led to a 0.843% reduction in query change rate decay and a 0.81% improvement in QAUC. Additionally, LEMUR has shown significant gains across key offline metrics for Douyin Advertisement. Our results validate the superiority of end-to-end multimodal recommendation in real-world industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We present KForge, a platform-agnostic framework built on two collaborative LLM-based agents: a generation agent that produces and iteratively refines programs through compilation and correctness feedback, and a performance analysis agent that interprets profiling data to guide optimization. This agent-based architecture requires only a single-shot example to target new platforms. We make three key contributions: (1) introducing an iterative refinement system where the generation agent and performance analysis agent collaborate through functional and optimization passes, interpreting diverse profiling data (from programmatic APIs to GUI-based tools) to generate actionable recommendations that guide program synthesis for arbitrary accelerators; (2) demonstrating that the generation agent effectively leverages cross-platform knowledge transfer, where a reference implementation from one architecture substantially improves generation quality for different hardware targets; and (3) validating the platform-agnostic nature of our approach by demonstrating effective program synthesis across fundamentally different parallel computing platforms: NVIDIA CUDA and Apple Metal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at MLSys 2026</p></details> |

While numerous defenses have been proposed to mitigate these attacks, the heterogeneous landscape of evaluation methodologies hinders fair comparison between defenses. This work presents a systematic (meta-)analysis of backdoor defenses through a comprehensive literature review and empirical evaluation. We analyzed 183 backdoor defense papers published between 2018 and 2025 across major AI and security venues, examining the properties and evaluation methodologies of these defenses. Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in experimental setups, evaluation metrics, and threat model assumptions in the literature. Through extensive experiments involving three datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K), four model architectures (ResNet-18, VGG-19, ViT-B/16, DenseNet-121), 16 representative defenses, and five commonly used attacks, totaling over 3\,000 experiments, we demonstrate that defense effectiveness varies substantially across different evaluation setups. We identify critical gaps in current evaluation practices, including insufficient reporting of computational overhead and behavior under benign conditions, bias in hyperparameter selection, and incomplete experimentation. Based on our findings, we provide concrete challenges and well-motivated recommendations to standardize and improve future defense evaluations. Our work aims to equip researchers and industry practitioners with actionable insights for developing, assessing, and deploying defenses to different systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surrogate Modeling and Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Complex Systems: A Workflow for Automated Simulation Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16742v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex systems are increasingly explored through simulation-driven engineering workflows that combine physics-based and empirical models with optimization and analytics. Despite their power, these workflows face two central obstacles: (1) high computational cost, since accurate exploration requires many expensive simulator runs; and (2) limited transparency and reliability when decisions rely on opaque blackbox components. We propose a workflow that addresses both challenges by training lightweight emulators on compact designs of experiments that (i) provide fast, low-latency approximations of expensive simulators, (ii) enable rigorous uncertainty quantification, and (iii) are adapted for global and local Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analyses. This workflow unifies every simulation-based complex-system analysis tool, ranging from engineering design to agent-based models for socio-environmental understanding. In this paper, we proposea comparative methodology and practical recommendations for using surrogate-based explainability tools within the proposed workflow. The methodology supports continuous and categorical inputs, combines global-effect and uncertainty analyses with local attribution, and evaluates the consistency of explanations across surrogate models, thereby diagnosing surrogate adequacy and guiding further data collection or model refinement. We demonstrate the approach on two contrasting case studies: a multidisciplinary design analysis of a hybrid-electric aircraft and an agent-based model of urban segregation. Results show that the surrogate model and XAI coupling enables large-scale exploration in seconds, uncovers nonlinear interactions and emergent behaviors, identifies key design and policy levers, and signals regions where surrogates require more data or alternative architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Recommendation Biases via Group-Alignment and Global-Uniformity in Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13041v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative Filtering~(CF) plays a crucial role in modern recommender systems, leveraging historical user-item interactions to provide personalized suggestions. However, CF-based methods often encounter biases due to imbalances in training data. This phenomenon makes CF-based methods tend to prioritize recommending popular items and performing unsatisfactorily on inactive users. Existing works address this issue by rebalancing training samples, reranking recommendation results, or making the modeling process robust to the bias. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches can compromise accuracy or be sensitive to weighting strategies, making them challenging to train. In this paper, we deeply analyze the causes and effects of the biases and propose a framework to alleviate biases in recommendation from the perspective of representation distribution, namely Group-Alignment and Global-Uniformity Enhanced Representation Learning for Debiasing Recommendation (AURL). Specifically, we identify two significant problems in the representation distribution of users and items, namely group-discrepancy and global-collapse. These two problems directly lead to biases in the recommendation results. To this end, we propose two simple but effective regularizers in the representation space, respectively named group-alignment and global-uniformity. The goal of group-alignment is to bring the representation distribution of long-tail entities closer to that of popular entities, while global-uniformity aims to preserve the information of entities as much as possible by evenly distributing representations. Our method directly optimizes both the group-alignment and global-uniformity regularization terms to mitigate recommendation biases. Extensive experiments on three real datasets and various recommendation backbones verify the superiority of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Predict the Next Question? A Collaborative Filtering Approach to Modeling User Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12949v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have excelled in language understanding and generation, powering advanced dialogue and recommendation systems. However, a significant limitation persists: these systems often model user preferences statically, failing to capture the dynamic and sequential nature of interactive behaviors. The sequence of a user's historical questions provides a rich, implicit signal of evolving interests and cognitive patterns, yet leveraging this temporal data for predictive tasks remains challenging due to the inherent disconnect between language modeling and behavioral sequence modeling. To bridge this gap, we propose a Collaborative Filtering-enhanced Question Prediction (CFQP) framework. CFQP dynamically models evolving user-question interactions by integrating personalized memory modules with graph-based preference propagation. This dual mechanism allows the system to adaptively learn from user-specific histories while refining predictions through collaborative signals from similar users. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively generates agents that mimic real-user questioning patterns, highlighting its potential for building proactive and adaptive dialogue systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tokenize Once, Recommend Anywhere: Unified Item Tokenization for Multi-domain LLM-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12922v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based recommender systems have achieved high-quality performance by bridging the discrepancy between the item space and the language space through item tokenization. However, existing item tokenization methods typically require training separate models for each item domain, limiting generalization. Moreover, the diverse distributions and semantics across item domains make it difficult to construct a unified tokenization that preserves domain-specific information. To address these challenges, we propose UniTok, a Unified item Tokenization framework that integrates our own mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with a series of codebooks to convert items into discrete tokens, enabling scalable tokenization while preserving semantic information across multiple item domains. Specifically, items from different domains are first projected into a unified latent space through a shared encoder. They are then routed to domain-specific experts to capture the unique semantics, while a shared expert, which is always active, encodes common knowledge transferable across domains. Additionally, to mitigate semantic imbalance across domains, we present a mutual information calibration mechanism, which guides the model towards retaining similar levels of semantic information for each domain. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed UniTok framework is (a) highly effective: achieving up to 51.89% improvements over strong benchmarks, (b) theoretically sound: showing the analytical validity of our architectural design and optimization; and (c) highly generalizable: demonstrating robust performance across diverse domains without requiring per-domain retraining, a capability not supported by existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables; Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26) (to appear) (Please cite our conference version.)</p></details> |

Fairness in this setting is critical, as biased predictions can exacerbate societal inequalities. Prior work adopts a dyadic definition of fairness, enforcing fairness through demographic parity between intra-group and inter-group link predictions. However, we show that this dyadic framing can obscure underlying disparities across subgroups, allowing systemic biases to go undetected. Moreover, we argue that demographic parity does not meet desired properties for fairness assessment in ranking-based tasks such as link prediction. We formalize the limitations of existing fairness evaluations and propose a framework that enables a more expressive assessment. Additionally, we propose a lightweight post-processing method combined with decoupled link predictors that effectively mitigates bias and achieves state-of-the-art fairness-utility trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures.

To this end, industrial practitioners have accumulated vast amounts of structured domain knowledge, which we term human priors (e.g., item taxonomies, temporal patterns). This knowledge is typically applied through post-hoc adjustments during ranking or post-ranking. However, this approach remains decoupled from the core model learning, which is particularly undesirable as the industry shifts to end-to-end generative recommendation foundation models. On the other hand, many methods targeting these beyond-accuracy objectives often require architecture-specific modifications and discard these valuable human priors by learning user intent in a fully unsupervised manner. Instead of discarding the human priors accumulated over years of practice, we introduce a backbone-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates these human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders. With lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangle user intent along human-understandable axes (e.g., interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests). We also introduce a hierarchical composition strategy for modeling complex interactions across different prior types. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives. We also show that human priors allow the backbone model to more effectively leverage longer context lengths and larger model sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Conversational Recommender Systems with Tree-Structured Knowledge and Pretrained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12579v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in pretrained language models (PLMs) have significantly improved conversational recommender systems (CRS), enabling more fluent and context-aware interactions. To further enhance accuracy and mitigate hallucination, many methods integrate PLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs), but face key challenges: failing to fully exploit PLM reasoning over graph relationships, indiscriminately incorporating retrieved knowledge without context filtering, and neglecting collaborative preferences in multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we propose PCRS-TKA, a prompt-based framework employing retrieval-augmented generation to integrate PLMs with KGs. PCRS-TKA constructs dialogue-specific knowledge trees from KGs and serializes them into texts, enabling structure-aware reasoning while capturing rich entity semantics. Our approach selectively filters context-relevant knowledge and explicitly models collaborative preferences using specialized supervision signals. A semantic alignment module harmonizes heterogeneous inputs, reducing noise and enhancing accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCRS-TKA consistently outperforms all baselines in both recommendation and conversational quality.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Generative Retrieval (GR) has emerged as a viable alternative to Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR), which quantizes items into a finite token space and decodes candidates autoregressively, providing a scalable path that explicitly models target-history interactions via cross-attention. However, three challenges persist: 1) how to balance users' long-term and short-term interests , 2) noise interference when generating hierarchical semantic IDs (SIDs), 3) the absence of explicit modeling for negative feedback such as exposed items without clicks. To address these challenges, we propose DualGR, a generative retrieval framework that explicitly models dual horizons of user interests with selective activation. Specifically, DualGR utilizes Dual-Branch Long/Short-Term Router (DBR) to cover both stable preferences and transient intents by explicitly modeling users' long- and short-term behaviors. Meanwhile, Search-based SID Decoding (S2D) is presented to control context-induced noise and enhance computational efficiency by constraining candidate interactions to the current coarse (level-1) bucket during fine-grained (level-2/3) SID prediction. % also reinforcing intra-class consistency. Finally, we propose an Exposure-aware Next-Token Prediction Loss (ENTP-Loss) that treats "exposed-but-unclicked" items as hard negatives at level-1, enabling timely interest fade-out. On the large-scale Kuaishou short-video recommendation system, DualGR has achieved outstanding performance. Online A/B testing shows +0.527% video views and +0.432% watch time lifts, validating DualGR as a practical and effective paradigm for industrial generative retrieval.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained dynamic graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn user-item representations over temporal snapshot graphs. However, fine-tuning GNNs on these graphs often results in generalization issues due to temporal discrepancies between pre-training and fine-tuning stages, limiting the model's ability to capture evolving user preferences. To address this, we propose TarDGR, a task-aware retrieval-augmented framework designed to enhance generalization capability by incorporating task-aware model and retrieval-augmentation. Specifically, TarDGR introduces a Task-Aware Evaluation Mechanism to identify semantically relevant historical subgraphs, enabling the construction of task-specific datasets without manual labeling. It also presents a Graph Transformer-based Task-Aware Model that integrates semantic and structural encodings to assess subgraph relevance. During inference, TarDGR retrieves and fuses task-aware subgraphs with the query subgraph, enriching its representation and mitigating temporal generalization issues. Experiments on multiple large-scale dynamic graph datasets demonstrate that TarDGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with extensive empirical evidence underscoring its superior accuracy and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

While audio descriptions (AD) can make videos accessible, describing movements remains challenging as the AD must convey what to do (mechanics, location, orientation) and how to do it (speed, fluidity, timing). Prior work thus used multimodal instruction to support BLV learners with individual simple movements. However, it is unclear how these approaches scale to dance instruction with unique, complex movements and precise timing constraints. To inform accessible remote dance instruction systems, we conducted three co-design workshops (N=28) with BLV dancers, instructors, and experts in sound, haptics, and AD. Participants designed 8 systems revealing common themes: staged learning to dissect routines, crafting vocabularies for movements, and selectively using modalities (narration for movement structure, sound for expression, and haptics for spatial cues). We conclude with design recommendations to make learning dance accessible.</p></details> |  |

While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong performance by capturing long-range temporal dependencies, their reliance on self-attention results in quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, limiting scalability on high-frequency or large-scale graphs. In this work, we revisit the necessity of self-attention in dynamic graph modeling. Inspired by recent findings that attribute the success of Transformers more to their architectural design than attention itself, we propose GLFormer, a novel attention-free Transformer-style framework for dynamic graphs. GLFormer introduces an adaptive token mixer that performs context-aware local aggregation based on interaction order and time intervals. To capture long-term dependencies, we further design a hierarchical aggregation module that expands the temporal receptive field by stacking local token mixers across layers. Experiments on six widely-used dynamic graph benchmarks show that GLFormer achieves SOTA performance, which reveals that attention-free architectures can match or surpass Transformer baselines in dynamic graph settings with significantly improved efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We introduce a proof-of-concept conversational self-triage system that guides LLMs with 100 clinically validated flowcharts from the American Medical Association, providing a structured and auditable framework for patient decision support. The system leverages a multi-agent framework consisting of a retrieval agent, a decision agent, and a chat agent to identify the most relevant flowchart, interpret patient responses, and deliver personalized, patient-friendly recommendations, respectively. Performance was evaluated at scale using synthetic datasets of simulated conversations. The system achieved 95.29% top-3 accuracy in flowchart retrieval (N=2,000) and 99.10% accuracy in flowchart navigation across varied conversational styles and conditions (N=37,200). By combining the flexibility of free-text interaction with the rigor of standardized clinical protocols, this approach demonstrates the feasibility of transparent, accurate, and generalizable AI-assisted self-triage, with potential to support informed patient decision-making while improving healthcare resource utilization.</p></details> |  |

We present a control framework that mitigates misinformation spread while maintaining user engagement by penalizing content characteristics commonly exploited by false information, specifically, extreme negative sentiment and novelty. We extend the closed-loop Friedkin-Johnsen model to incorporate the mitigation of misinformation together with the maximization of user engagement. Both model-free and model-based control strategies demonstrate up to 76% reduction in misinformation propagation across diverse network configurations, validated through simulations using the LIAR2 dataset with sentiment features extracted via large language models. Analysis of engagement-misinformation trade-offs reveals that in networks with radical users, median engagement improves even as misinformation decreases, suggesting content moderation enhances discourse quality for non-extremist users. The framework provides practical guidance for platform operators in balancing misinformation suppression with engagement objectives.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in diffusion-based generative recommenders have shown promise in capturing the dynamic nature of user preferences. These approaches explore a broader range of user interests by progressively perturbing the distribution of user-item interactions and recovering potential preferences from noise, enabling nuanced behavioral understanding. However, existing diffusion-based approaches predominantly operate in continuous space through encoded graph-based historical interactions, which may compromise potential information loss and suffer from computational inefficiency. As such, we propose CDRec, a novel Continuous-time Discrete-space Diffusion Recommendation framework, which models user behavior patterns through discrete diffusion on historical interactions over continuous time. The discrete diffusion algorithm operates via discrete element operations (e.g., masking) while incorporating domain knowledge through transition matrices, producing more meaningful diffusion trajectories. Furthermore, the continuous-time formulation enables flexible adaptive sampling. To better adapt discrete diffusion models to recommendations, CDRec introduces: (1) a novel popularity-aware noise schedule that generates semantically meaningful diffusion trajectories, and (2) an efficient training framework combining consistency parameterization for fast sampling and a contrastive learning objective guided by multi-hop collaborative signals for personalized recommendation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate CDRec's superior performance in both recommendation accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WSDM 2026</p></details> |

Recent works show that pre-trained dynamic graph neural networks (GNNs) can achieve excellent performance. However, existing methods by fine-tuning node representations at large scales demand significant computational resources. Additionally, the long-tail distribution of degrees leads to insufficient representations for nodes with sparse interactions, posing challenges for efficient fine-tuning. To address these issues, we introduce GraphSASA, a novel method for efficient fine-tuning in dynamic recommendation systems. GraphSASA employs test-time augmentation by leveraging the similarity of node representation distributions during hierarchical graph aggregation, which enhances node representations. Then it applies singular value decomposition, freezing the original vector matrix while focusing fine-tuning on the derived singular value matrices, which reduces the parameter burden of fine-tuning and improves the fine-tuning adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale datasets.</p></details> | ICASSP 2025 |
| **[Constructing Political Coordinates: Aggregating Over the Opposition for Diverse News Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17574v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the past two decades, open access to news and information has increased rapidly, empowering educated political growth within democratic societies. News recommender systems (NRSs) have shown to be useful in this process, minimizing political disengagement and information overload by providing individuals with articles on topics that matter to them. Unfortunately, NRSs often conflate underlying user interest with the partisan bias of the articles in their reading history and with the most popular biases present in the coverage of their favored topics. Over extended interaction, this can result in the formation of filter bubbles and the polarization of user partisanship. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding space called Constructed Political Coordinates (CPC), which models the political partisanship of users over a given topic-space, relative to a larger sample population. We apply a simple collaborative filtering (CF) framework using CPC-based correlation to recommend articles sourced from oppositional users, who have different biases from the user in question. We compare against classical CF methods and find that CPC-based methods promote pointed bias diversity and better match the true political tolerance of users, while classical methods implicitly exploit biases to maximize interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to appear in the proceedings of the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Big Data</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce an annotated corpus of 6,393 radiology reports from 586 patients, each labeled for follow-up imaging status, to support the development and benchmarking of follow-up adherence detection systems. Using this corpus, we systematically compared traditional machine-learning classifiers, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), Longformer, and a fully fine-tuned Llama3-8B-Instruct, with recent generative LLMs. To evaluate generative LLMs, we tested GPT-4o and the open-source GPT-OSS-20B under two configurations: a baseline (Base) and a task-optimized (Advanced) setting that focused inputs on metadata, recommendation sentences, and their surrounding context. A refined prompt for GPT-OSS-20B further improved reasoning accuracy. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, and F1 scores with 95% confidence intervals estimated via non-parametric bootstrapping. Inter-annotator agreement was high (F1 = 0.846). GPT-4o (Advanced) achieved the best performance (F1 = 0.832), followed closely by GPT-OSS-20B (Advanced; F1 = 0.828). LR and SVM also performed strongly (F1 = 0.776 and 0.775), underscoring that while LLMs approach human-level agreement through prompt optimization, interpretable and resource-efficient models remain valuable baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to LREC 2026</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness is often limited by existing studies that focus on modeling user ratings for individual items. This point-wise approach leads to prevalent issues such as inaccurate user preference comprehension and rigid item-semantic representations. To address these limitations, we propose the novel Set-wise Reflective Learning Framework (SRLF). Our framework operationalizes a closed-loop "assess-validate-reflect" cycle that harnesses the powerful in-context learning capabilities of LLMs. SRLF departs from conventional point-wise assessment by formulating a holistic judgment on an entire set of items. It accomplishes this by comprehensively analyzing both the intricate interrelationships among items within the set and their collective alignment with the user's preference profile. This method of set-level contextual understanding allows our model to capture complex relational patterns essential to user behavior, making it significantly more adept for sequential recommendation. Extensive experiments validate our approach, confirming that this set-wise perspective is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance in sequential recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Several group recommender systems have been proposed, but these methods often struggle due to sparsity and high-dimensionality of the available data, common in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a group recommender system called Group Soft-Impute SVD, which leverages soft-impute singular value decomposition to enhance group recommendations. This approach addresses the challenge of sparse high-dimensional data using low-rank matrix completion. We compared the performance of Group Soft-Impute SVD with Group MF based approaches and found that our method outperforms the baselines in recall for small user groups while achieving comparable results across all group sizes when tasked on Goodbooks, Movielens, and Synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our method recovers lower matrix ranks than the baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>((1) ...</summary><p>((1) African University of Science and Technology (Abuja, Nigeria), (2) Baze University (Abuja, Nigeria), (3) Babes-Bolyai University (Cluj-Napoca, Romania))</p></details> |

Their formation is affected by many environmental parameters, making it difficult to monitor and detect disinfection byproducts before they reach households. Due to the large variety of disinfection byproduct compounds that can be formed in water distribution networks, plus the constrained number of sensors that can be deployed throughout a system to monitor these contaminants, it is of outmost importance to place sensory equipment efficiently and optimally. In this paper, we present DBPFinder, a simulation software that assists in the strategic sensor placement for detecting disinfection byproducts, tested at a real-world water distribution network in Coimbra, Portugal. This simulator addresses multiple performance objectives at once in order to provide optimal solution placement recommendations to water utility operators based on their needs. A number of different experiments performed indicate its correctness, relevance, efficiency and scalability.</p></details> |  |

While recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that encourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on relative comparison. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval consistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper quality evaluation. In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper recommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained strong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and attracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers -- demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in AAAI'26</p></details> |

MLLMs deployed on devices have to continuously adapt to dynamic scenarios in downstream tasks, such as variations in background and perspective, to effectively perform complex visual tasks. To this end, we construct a multimodal visual understanding dataset (MSVQA) encompassing four different scenarios and perspectives including high altitude, underwater, low altitude and indoor, to investigate the catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs under the dynamics of scenario shifts in real-world data streams. Furthermore, we propose mUltimodal coNtInual learning with MLLMs From multi-scenarIo pERspectives (UNIFIER) to address visual discrepancies while learning different scenarios. Specifically, it decouples the visual information from different scenarios into distinct branches within each vision block and projects them into the same feature space. A consistency constraint is imposed on the features of each branch to maintain the stability of visual representations across scenarios. Extensive experiments on the MSVQA dataset demonstrate that UNIFIER effectively alleviates forgetting of cross-scenario tasks and achieves knowledge accumulation within the same scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 16 figures.

| **[PriorDrive: Enhancing Online HD Mapping with Unified Vector Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05352v4)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-Definition Maps (HD maps) are essential for the precise navigation and decision-making of autonomous vehicles, yet their creation and upkeep present significant cost and timeliness challenges. The online construction of HD maps using on-board sensors has emerged as a promising solution; however, these methods can be impeded by incomplete data due to occlusions and inclement weather, while their performance in distant regions remains unsatisfying. This paper proposes PriorDrive to address these limitations by directly harnessing the power of various vectorized prior maps, significantly enhancing the robustness and accuracy of online HD map construction. Our approach integrates a variety of prior maps uniformly, such as OpenStreetMap's Standard Definition Maps (SD maps), outdated HD maps from vendors, and locally constructed maps from historical vehicle data. To effectively integrate such prior information into online mapping models, we introduce a Hybrid Prior Representation (HPQuery) that standardizes the representation of diverse map elements. We further propose a Unified Vector Encoder (UVE), which employs fused prior embedding and a dual encoding mechanism to encode vector data. To improve the UVE's generalizability and performance, we propose a segment-level and point-level pre-training strategy that enables the UVE to learn the prior distribution of vector data. Through extensive testing on the nuScenes, Argoverse 2 and OpenLane-V2, we demonstrate that PriorDrive is highly compatible with various online mapping models and substantially improves map prediction capabilities. The integration of prior maps through PriorDrive offers a robust solution to the challenges of single-perception data, paving the way for more reliable autonomous vehicle navigation.

| **[FreeInv: Free Lunch for Improving DDIM Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23035v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Naive DDIM inversion process usually suffers from a trajectory deviation issue, i.e., the latent trajectory during reconstruction deviates from the one during inversion. To alleviate this issue, previous methods either learn to mitigate the deviation or design cumbersome compensation strategy to reduce the mismatch error, exhibiting substantial time and computation cost. In this work, we present a nearly free-lunch method (named FreeInv) to address the issue more effectively and efficiently. In FreeInv, we randomly transform the latent representation and keep the transformation the same between the corresponding inversion and reconstruction time-step. It is motivated from a statistical perspective that an ensemble of DDIM inversion processes for multiple trajectories yields a smaller trajectory mismatch error on expectation. Moreover, through theoretical analysis and empirical study, we show that FreeInv performs an efficient ensemble of multiple trajectories. FreeInv can be freely integrated into existing inversion-based image and video editing techniques. Especially for inverting video sequences, it brings more significant fidelity and efficiency improvements. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation on PIE benchmark and DAVIS dataset shows that FreeInv remarkably outperforms conventional DDIM inversion, and is competitive among previous state-of-the-art inversion methods, with superior computation efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Existing upsampling approaches face a fundamental trade-off: classical filters are fast and broadly applicable but rely on fixed forms, while modern upsamplers achieve superior accuracy through learnable, VFM-specific forms at the cost of retraining for each VFM. We introduce Neighborhood Attention Filtering (NAF), which bridges this gap by learning adaptive spatial-and-content weights through Cross-Scale Neighborhood Attention and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), guided solely by the high-resolution input image. NAF operates zero-shot: it upsamples features from any VFM without retraining, making it the first VFM-agnostic architecture to outperform VFM-specific upsamplers and achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks. It maintains high efficiency, scaling to 2K feature maps and reconstructing intermediate-resolution maps at 18 FPS. Beyond feature upsampling, NAF demonstrates strong performance on image restoration, highlighting its versatility.

However, current methods that leverage 2D data often result in large, slow-to-train models, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy in resource-constrained environments. The architecture design of such models is therefore critical, determining their performance, memory footprint, and compute efficiency. The Joint-embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) has gained wide popularity in self-supervised learning for its simplicity and efficiency, but has been under-explored in cross-modal settings, partly due to the misconception that masking is intrinsic to JEPA. In this light, we propose CrossJEPA, a simple Cross-modal Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that harnesses the knowledge of an image foundation model and trains a predictor to infer embeddings of specific rendered 2D views from corresponding 3D point clouds, thereby introducing a JEPA-style pretraining strategy beyond masking. By conditioning the predictor on cross-domain projection information, CrossJEPA purifies the supervision signal from semantics exclusive to the target domain. We further exploit the frozen teacher design with a one-time target embedding caching mechanism, yielding amortized efficiency. CrossJEPA achieves a new state-of-the-art in linear probing on the synthetic ModelNet40 (94.2%) and the real-world ScanObjectNN (88.3%) benchmarks, using only 14.1M pretraining parameters (8.5M in the point encoder), and about 6 pretraining hours on a standard single GPU. These results position CrossJEPA as a performant, memory-efficient, and fast-to-train framework for 3D representation learning via knowledge distillation. We analyze CrossJEPA intuitively, theoretically, and empirically, and extensively ablate our design choices. Code will be made available.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |

Manual delineation is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, while current automated methods often trade accuracy for computational cost, limiting clinical use. We present NeuroVascU-Net, the first deep learning architecture specifically designed to segment cerebrovascular structures directly from clinically standard T1CE MRI in neuro-oncology patients, addressing a gap in prior work dominated by TOF-MRA-based approaches. NeuroVascU-Net builds on a dilated U-Net and integrates two specialized modules: a Multi-Scale Contextual Feature Fusion ($MSC^2F$) module at the bottleneck and a Cross-Domain Adaptive Feature Fusion ($CDA^2F$) module at deeper hierarchical layers. $MSC^2F$ captures both local and global information via multi-scale dilated convolutions, while $CDA^2F$ dynamically integrates domain-specific features, enhancing representation while keeping computation low. The model was trained and validated on a curated dataset of T1CE scans from 137 brain tumor biopsy patients, annotated by a board-certified functional neurosurgeon. NeuroVascU-Net achieved a Dice score of 0.8609 and precision of 0.8841, accurately segmenting both major and fine vascular structures. Notably, it requires only 12.4M parameters, significantly fewer than transformer-based models such as Swin U-NetR. This balance of accuracy and efficiency positions NeuroVascU-Net as a practical solution for computer-assisted neurosurgical planning.</p></details> |  |

While electroencephalography (EEG) is a practical tool for this task, existing models struggle with the common challenge of imperfect medical data, such as learning a ``normal'' baseline from weakly supervised, healthy-only cohorts. This is a critical anomaly detection task for identifying disease, but standard models are often black boxes lacking an interpretable structure. We propose EVA-Net, a novel framework that recasts brain age as an interpretable anomaly detection problem. EVA-Net uses an efficient, sparsified-attention Transformer to model long EEG sequences. To handle noise and variability in imperfect data, it employs a Variational Information Bottleneck to learn a robust, compressed representation. For interpretability, this representation is aligned to a continuous prototype network that explicitly learns the normative healthy aging manifold. Trained on 1297 healthy subjects, EVA-Net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. We validated its anomaly detection capabilities on an unseen cohort of 27 MCI and AD patients. This pathological group showed significantly higher brain-age gaps and a novel Prototype Alignment Error, confirming their deviation from the healthy manifold. EVA-Net provides an interpretable framework for healthcare intelligence using imperfect medical data.</p></details> |  |

However, existing studies remain limited in addressing two main challenges of multi-view molecular learning: (1) discovering shared information between two views while diminishing view-specific information and (2) identifying and aligning important substructures, e.g., functional groups, which are crucial for enhancing cross-view consistency and model expressiveness. To solve these challenges, we propose a Multi-View Conditional Information Bottleneck framework, called MVCIB, for pre-training graph neural networks on 2D and 3D molecular structures in a self-supervised setting. Our idea is to discover the shared information while minimizing irrelevant features from each view under the MVCIB principle, which uses one view as a contextual condition to guide the representation learning of its counterpart. To enhance semantic and structural consistency across views, we utilize key substructures, e.g., functional groups and ego-networks, as anchors between the two views. Then, we propose a cross-attention mechanism that captures fine-grained correlations between the substructures to achieve subgraph alignment across views. Extensive experiments in four molecular domains demonstrated that MVCIB consistently outperforms baselines in both predictive performance and interpretability. Moreover, MVCIB achieved the 3d Weisfeiler-Lehman expressiveness power to distinguish not only non-isomorphic graphs but also different 3D geometries that share identical 2D connectivity, such as isomers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Implicit Fields via Hypernetwork-Driven Multiscale Coordinate Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18387v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for representing signals such as images, 3D shapes, signed distance fields, and radiance fields. While significant progress has been made in architecture design (e.g., SIREN, FFC, KAN-based INRs) and optimization strategies (meta-learning, amortization, distillation), existing approaches still suffer from two core limitations: (1) a representation bottleneck that forces a single MLP to uniformly model heterogeneous local structures, and (2) limited scalability due to the absence of a hierarchical mechanism that dynamically adapts to signal complexity. This work introduces Hyper-Coordinate Implicit Neural Representations (HC-INR), a new class of INRs that break the representational bottleneck by learning signal-adaptive coordinate transformations using a hypernetwork. HC-INR decomposes the representation task into two components: (i) a learned multiscale coordinate transformation module that warps the input domain into a disentangled latent space, and (ii) a compact implicit field network that models the transformed signal with significantly reduced complexity. The proposed model introduces a hierarchical hypernetwork architecture that conditions coordinate transformations on local signal features, enabling dynamic allocation of representation capacity. We theoretically show that HC-INR strictly increases the upper bound of representable frequency bands while maintaining Lipschitz stability. Extensive experiments across image fitting, shape reconstruction, and neural radiance field approximation demonstrate that HC-INR achieves up to 4 times higher reconstruction fidelity than strong INR baselines while using 30--60\% fewer parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[MimiCAT: Mimic with Correspondence-Aware Cascade-Transformer for Category-Free 3D Pose Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18370v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D pose transfer aims to transfer the pose-style of a source mesh to a target character while preserving both the target's geometry and the source's pose characteristic. Existing methods are largely restricted to characters with similar structures and fail to generalize to category-free settings (e.g., transferring a humanoid's pose to a quadruped). The key challenge lies in the structural and transformation diversity inherent in distinct character types, which often leads to mismatched regions and poor transfer quality. To address these issues, we first construct a million-scale pose dataset across hundreds of distinct characters. We further propose MimiCAT, a cascade-transformer model designed for category-free 3D pose transfer. Instead of relying on strict one-to-one correspondence mappings, MimiCAT leverages semantic keypoint labels to learn a novel soft correspondence that enables flexible many-to-many matching across characters. The pose transfer is then formulated as a conditional generation process, in which the source transformations are first projected onto the target through soft correspondence matching and subsequently refined using shape-conditioned representations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that MimiCAT transfers plausible poses across different characters, significantly outperforming prior methods that are limited to narrow category transfer (e.g., humanoid-to-humanoid).</p></details> | tech report |
| **[Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network Model for Citywide Air Pollution Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12630v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Citywide Air Pollution Forecasting tries to precisely predict the air quality multiple hours ahead for the entire city. This topic is challenged since air pollution varies in a spatiotemporal manner and depends on many complicated factors. Our previous research has solved the problem by considering the whole city as an image and leveraged a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model to learn the spatiotemporal features. However, an image-based representation may not be ideal as air pollution and other impact factors have natural graph structures. In this research, we argue that a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) can efficiently represent the spatial features of air quality readings in the whole city. Specially, we extend the ConvLSTM model to a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (Spatiotemporal GCRNN) model by tightly integrating a GCN architecture into an RNN structure for efficient learning spatiotemporal characteristics of air quality values and their influential factors. Our extensive experiments prove the proposed model has a better performance compare to the state-of-the-art ConvLSTM model for air pollution predicting while the number of parameters is much smaller. Moreover, our approach is also superior to a hybrid GCN-based method in a real-world air pollution dataset.</p></details> | Updated metadata |

This paper introduces the Augmentation-driven Multiview Audio Transformer (AMAuT), a training-from-scratch framework that eliminates the dependency on pre-trained weights while supporting arbitrary sample rates and audio lengths. AMAuT integrates four key components: (1) augmentation-driven multiview learning for robustness, (2) a conv1 + conv7 + conv1 one-dimensional CNN bottleneck for stable temporal encoding, (3) dual CLS + TAL tokens for bidirectional context representation, and (4) test-time adaptation/augmentation (TTA^2) to improve inference reliability. Experiments on five public benchmarks, AudioMNIST, SpeechCommands V1 & V2, VocalSound, and CochlScene, show that AMAuT achieves accuracies up to 99.8% while consuming less than 3% of the GPU hours required by comparable pre-trained models. Thus, AMAuT presents a highly efficient and flexible alternative to large pre-trained models, making state-of-the-art audio classification accessible in computationally constrained settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updating note: 1.

Such unfairness might arise from biased training data, model design, or representational disparities across groups, posing significant challenges in high-stakes decision-making domains such as college admissions. While existing fair learning models aim to mitigate bias, achieving an optimal trade-off between fairness and accuracy remains a challenge. Moreover, the reliance on black-box models hinders interpretability, limiting their applicability in socially sensitive domains. To circumvent these issues, we propose integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within a fair adversarial learning framework. Leveraging the adversarial robustness and interpretability of KANs, our approach facilitates stable adversarial learning. We derive theoretical insights into the spline-based KAN architecture that ensure stability during adversarial optimization. Additionally, an adaptive fairness penalty update mechanism is proposed to strike a balance between fairness and accuracy. We back these findings with empirical evidence on two real-world admissions datasets, demonstrating the proposed framework's efficiency in achieving fairness across sensitive attributes while preserving predictive performance.</p></details> | Accepted at AAAI-26 |

Traditional graph neural network algorithms often fail because they learn spurious environmental correlations instead of stable causal relationships, leading to substantial performance degradation under distribution shifts. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue due to their vast world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, effectively integrating this knowledge with the fine-grained topology of specific graphs to solve the OOD problem remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose {$\textbf{Inv}$ariant $\textbf{G}$raph $\textbf{C}$ontrastive Learning with $\textbf{LLM}$s for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation (InvGCLLM)}, an innovative causal learning framework that synergistically integrates the strengths of data-driven models and knowledge-driven LLMs. Our framework first employs a data-driven invariant learning model to generate causal confidence scores for each user-item interaction. These scores then guide an LLM to perform targeted graph refinement, leveraging its world knowledge to prune spurious connections and augment missing causal links. Finally, the structurally purified graphs provide robust supervision for a causality-guided contrastive learning objective, enabling the model to learn representations that are resilient to spurious correlations. Experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that InvGCLLM achieves significant improvements in out-of-distribution recommendation, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

We show that TabPFN possesses a broader effective frequency capacity than standard ReLU-MLPs, even without hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, unlike MLPs whose spectra evolve primarily over training epochs, we find that TabPFN's spectral capacity adapts directly to the number of samples provided in-context, a phenomenon we term Spectral Adaptivity. We further demonstrate that positional encoding modulates TabPFN's frequency response, mirroring classical results in implicit neural representations. Finally, we show that these properties enable TabPFN to perform training-free and hyperparameter-free image denoising, illustrating its potential as a task-agnostic implicit model. Our analysis provides new insight into the structure and inductive biases of tabular foundation models and highlights their promise for broader signal reconstruction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[IIKL: Isometric Immersion Kernel Learning with Riemannian Manifold for Geometric Preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06288v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric representation learning in preserving the intrinsic geometric and topological properties for discrete non-Euclidean data is crucial in scientific applications. Previous research generally mapped non-Euclidean discrete data into Euclidean space during representation learning, which may lead to the loss of some critical geometric information. In this paper, we propose a novel Isometric Immersion Kernel Learning (IIKL) method to build Riemannian manifold and isometrically induce Riemannian metric from discrete non-Euclidean data. We prove that Isometric immersion is equivalent to the kernel function in the tangent bundle on the manifold, which explicitly guarantees the invariance of the inner product between vectors in the arbitrary tangent space throughout the learning process, thus maintaining the geometric structure of the original data. Moreover, a novel parameterized learning model based on IIKL is introduced, and an alternating training method for this model is derived using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), ensuring efficient convergence. Experimental results proved that using the learned Riemannian manifold and its metric, our model preserved the intrinsic geometric representation of data in both 3D and high-dimensional datasets successfully, and significantly improved the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as data reconstruction and classification. It is showed that our method could reduce the inner product invariant loss by more than 90% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, also achieved an average 40% improvement in downstream reconstruction accuracy and a 90% reduction in error for geometric metrics involving isometric and conformal.</p></details> | <details><summary>We de...</summary><p>We decided to withdraw this submission because we identified a statistical issue in the experimental section.

We present MammothModa2 (Mammoth2), a unified autoregressive-diffusion (AR-Diffusion) framework designed to effectively couple autoregressive semantic planning with diffusion-based generation. Mammoth2 adopts a serial design: an AR path equipped with generation experts performs global semantic modeling over discrete tokens, while a single-stream Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder handles high-fidelity image synthesis. A carefully designed AR-Diffusion feature alignment module combines multi-layer feature aggregation, unified condition encoding, and in-context conditioning to stably align AR's representations with the diffusion decoder's continuous latents. Mammoth2 is trained end-to-end with joint Next-Token Prediction and Flow Matching objectives, followed by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning over both generation and editing. With roughly 60M supervised generation samples and no reliance on pre-trained generators, Mammoth2 delivers strong text-to-image and instruction-based editing performance on public benchmarks, achieving 0.87 on GenEval, 87.2 on DPGBench, and 4.06 on ImgEdit, while remaining competitive with understanding-only backbones (e.g., Qwen3-VL-8B) on multimodal understanding tasks. These results suggest that a carefully coupled AR-Diffusion architecture can provide high-fidelity generation and editing while maintaining strong multimodal comprehension within a single, parameter- and data-efficient model.</p></details> |  |

We show that speech foundation models learn representations that generalize beyond the speech domain and achieve state-of-the-art performance on diverse time-series tasks from wearable sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on modality-specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and activity classification tasks. We find that the convolutional feature encoders of speech models are particularly relevant for wearable sensor applications. The proposed approach enhances performance on data-scarce time-series tasks using simple probing methods. This work takes a step toward developing generalized time-series models that unify speech and sensor modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |
| **[A Convex-Inspired Neural Construction for Structured and Generalizable Nonlinear Model Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18241v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time simulation of deformable objects relies on model reduction to achieve interactive performance while maintaining physical fidelity. Traditional linear methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), provide structured and predictable behavior thanks to their linear formulation, but are limited in expressiveness. Nonlinear model reduction, typically implemented with neural networks, offers richer representations and higher compression; however, without structural constraints, the learned mappings often fail to generalize beyond the training distribution, leading to unstable or implausible deformations. We present a symmetric, convex-inspired neural formulation that bridges the gap between linear and nonlinear model reduction. Our approach adopts an input-convex neural network (ICNN) augmented with symmetry constraints to impose structure on the nonlinear decoder. This design retains the flexibility of neural mappings while embedding physical consistency, yielding coherent and stable displacements even under unseen conditions. We evaluate our method on challenging deformation scenarios involving forces of different magnitudes, inverse directions, and sparsely sampled training data. Our approach demonstrates superior generalization while maintaining compact reduced spaces, and supports real-time interactive applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight Autoencoder-Isolation Forest Anomaly Detection for Green IoT Edge Gateways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18235v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to highly diverse and interconnected ecosystems that are increasingly susceptible to sophisticated cyber threats. Conventional anomaly detection schemes often prioritize accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency and environmental impact, which limits their deployment in resource-constrained edge environments. This paper presents \textit{EcoDefender}, a sustainable hybrid anomaly detection framework that integrates \textit{Autoencoder(AE)}-based representation learning with \textit{Isolation Forest(IF)} anomaly scoring. Beyond empirical performance, EcoDefender is supported by a theoretical foundation that establishes formal guarantees for its stability, convergence, robustness, and energy-complexity coupling-thereby linking computational behavior to energy efficiency. Furthermore, experiments on realistic IoT traffic confirm these theoretical insights, achieving up to 94\% detection accuracy with an average CPU usage of only 22\%, 27 ms inference latency, and 30\% lower energy consumption compared to AE-only baselines. By embedding sustainability metrics directly into the security evaluation process, this work demonstrates that reliable anomaly detection and environmental responsibility can coexist within next-generation green IoT infrastructures, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 9: resilient infrastructure, SDG 13: climate action).</p></details> |  |
| **[Situationally-Aware Dynamics Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19574v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robots operating in complex, unstructured environments face significant challenges due to latent, unobserved factors that obscure their understanding of both their internal state and the external world. Addressing this challenge would enable robots to develop a more profound grasp of their operational context. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework for online learning of hidden state representations, with which the robots can adapt in real-time to uncertain and dynamic conditions that would otherwise be ambiguous and result in suboptimal or erroneous behaviors. Our approach is formalized as a Generalized Hidden Parameter Markov Decision Process, which explicitly models the influence of unobserved parameters on both transition dynamics and reward structures. Our core innovation lies in learning online the joint distribution of state transitions, which serves as an expressive representation of latent ego- and environmental-factors. This probabilistic approach supports the identification and adaptation to different operational situations, improving robustness and safety. Through a multivariate extension of Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection, our method segments changes in the underlying data generating process governing the robot's dynamics. The robot's transition model is then informed with a symbolic representation of the current situation derived from the joint distribution of latest state transitions, enabling adaptive and context-aware decision-making. To showcase the real-world effectiveness, we validate our approach in the challenging task of unstructured terrain navigation, where unmodeled and unmeasured terrain characteristics can significantly impact the robot's motion. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real world reveal significant improvements in data efficiency, policy performance, and the emergence of safer, adaptive navigation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning with Shared Representations: Statistical Rates and Efficient Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04919v3)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative learning through latent shared feature representations enables heterogeneous clients to train personalized models with improved performance and reduced sample complexity. Despite empirical success and extensive study, the theoretical understanding of such methods remains incomplete, even for representations restricted to low-dimensional linear subspaces. In this work, we establish new upper and lower bounds on the statistical error in learning low-dimensional shared representations across clients. Our analysis captures both statistical heterogeneity (including covariate and concept shifts) and variation in local dataset sizes, aspects often overlooked in prior work. We further extend these results to nonlinear models including logistic regression and one-hidden-layer ReLU networks. Specifically, we design a spectral estimator that leverages independent replicas of local averages to approximate the non-convex least-squares solution and derive a nearly matching minimax lower bound. Our estimator achieves the optimal statistical rate when the shared representation is well covered across clients -- i.e., when no direction is severely underrepresented. Our results reveal two distinct phases of the optimal rate: a standard parameter-counting regime and a penalized regime when the number of clients is large or local datasets are small. These findings precisely characterize when collaboration benefits the overall system or individual clients in transfer learning and private fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[SkillWrapper: Generative Predicate Invention for Skill Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18203v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizing from individual skill executions to solving long-horizon tasks remains a core challenge in building autonomous agents. A promising direction is learning high-level, symbolic abstractions of the low-level skills of the agents, enabling reasoning and planning independent of the low-level state space. Among possible high-level representations, object-centric skill abstraction with symbolic predicates has been proven to be efficient because of its compatibility with domain-independent planners. Recent advances in foundation models have made it possible to generate symbolic predicates that operate on raw sensory inputs, a process we call generative predicate invention, to facilitate downstream abstraction learning. However, it remains unclear which formal properties the learned representations must satisfy, and how they can be learned to guarantee these properties. In this paper, we address both questions by presenting a formal theory of generative predicate invention for skill abstraction, resulting in symbolic operators that can be used for provably sound and complete planning. Within this framework, we propose SkillWrapper, a method that leverages foundation models to actively collect robot data and learn human-interpretable, plannable representations of black-box skills, using only RGB image observations. Our extensive empirical evaluation in simulation and on real robots shows that SkillWrapper learns abstract representations that enable solving unseen, long-horizon tasks in the real world with black-box skills.</p></details> |  |
| **[Off-Road Navigation via Implicit Neural Representation of Terrain Traversability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18183v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous off-road navigation requires robots to estimate terrain traversability from onboard sensors and plan accordingly. Conventional approaches typically rely on sampling-based planners such as MPPI to generate short-term control actions that aim to minimize traversal time and risk measures derived from the traversability estimates. These planners can react quickly but optimize only over a short look-ahead window, limiting their ability to reason about the full path geometry, which is important for navigating in challenging off-road environments. Moreover, they lack the ability to adjust speed based on the terrain bumpiness, which is important for smooth navigation on challenging terrains. In this paper, we introduce TRAIL (Traversability with an Implicit Learned Representation), an off-road navigation framework that leverages an implicit neural representation to continuously parameterize terrain properties. This representation yields spatial gradients that enable integration with a novel gradient-based trajectory optimization method that adapts the path geometry and speed profile based on terrain traversability.</p></details> | 9 pages |

In this work, we propose a method for generating privacy-preserving high-quality synthetic tabular data using Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). We benchmark the MPS-based generative model against state-of-the-art models such as CTGAN, VAE, and PrivBayes, focusing on both fidelity and privacy-preserving capabilities. To ensure differential privacy (DP), we integrate noise injection and gradient clipping during training, enabling privacy guarantees via Rényi Differential Privacy accounting. Across multiple metrics analyzing data fidelity and downstream machine learning task performance, our results show that MPS outperforms classical models, particularly under strict privacy constraints. This work highlights MPS as a promising tool for privacy-aware synthetic data generation. By combining the expressive power of tensor network representations with formal privacy mechanisms, the proposed approach offers an interpretable and scalable alternative for secure data sharing. Its structured design facilitates integration into sensitive domains where both data quality and confidentiality are critical.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Unified Spherical Frontend: Learning Rotation-Equivariant Representations of Spherical Images from Any Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18174v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern perception increasingly relies on fisheye, panoramic, and other wide field-of-view (FoV) cameras, yet most pipelines still apply planar CNNs designed for pinhole imagery on 2D grids, where image-space neighborhoods misrepresent physical adjacency and models are sensitive to global rotations. Frequency-domain spherical CNNs partially address this mismatch but require costly spherical harmonic transforms that constrain resolution and efficiency. We introduce the Unified Spherical Frontend (USF), a lens-agnostic framework that transforms images from any calibrated camera into a unit-sphere representation via ray-direction correspondences, and performs spherical resampling, convolution, and pooling directly in the spatial domain. USF is modular: projection, location sampling, interpolation, and resolution control are fully decoupled. Its distance-only spherical kernels offer configurable rotation-equivariance (mirroring translation-equivariance in planar CNNs) while avoiding harmonic transforms entirely. We compare standard planar backbones with their spherical counterparts across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on synthetic (Spherical MNIST) and real-world datasets (PANDORA, Stanford 2D-3D-S), and stress-test robustness to extreme lens distortions, varying FoV, and arbitrary rotations. USF processes high-resolution spherical imagery efficiently and maintains less than 1% performance drop under random test-time rotations, even without rotational augmentation, and even enables zero-shot generalization from one lens type to unseen wide-FoV lenses with minimal performance degradation.</p></details> |  |

Exact computation of this parameter is NP-hard, restricting classical methods to small instances. We compare two neural paradigms: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which operate on adjacency matrix representations, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which learn directly from graph structure through message passing. Across 2,000 random graphs with up to 64 vertices, GNNs achieve markedly higher accuracy ($R^2=0.987$, MAE $=0.372$) than CNNs ($R^2=0.955$, MAE $=0.500$). Both models offer substantial speedups over exact solvers, with GNNs delivering more than $200\times$ acceleration while retaining near-perfect fidelity. Our results position GNNs as a practical surrogate for combinatorial graph invariants, with implications for scalable graph optimization and mathematical discovery.</p></details> |  |

We study ObAct on a dual-arm robotic system equipped with wrist-mounted cameras. At test time, ObAct dynamically assigns observer and actor roles: the observer arm constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation from three images, virtually explores this to find an optimal camera pose, then moves to this pose; the actor arm then executes a policy using the observer's observations. This formulation enhances the clarity and visibility of both the object and the gripper in the policy's observations. As a result, we enable the training of ambidextrous policies on observations that remain closer to the occlusion-free training distribution, leading to more robust policies. We study this formulation with two existing imitation learning methods -- trajectory transfer and behavior cloning -- and experiments show that ObAct significantly outperforms static-camera setups: trajectory transfer improves by 145% without occlusion and 233% with occlusion, while behavior cloning improves by 75% and 143%, respectively.

However, existing methods are ill-suited for these scenarios, as they typically require offline access to accumulated video sequences and cannot incorporate language guidance that conveys task intent. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SFHand, the first streaming framework for language-guided 3D hand forecasting. SFHand autoregressively predicts a comprehensive set of future 3D hand states, including hand type, 2D bounding box, 3D pose, and trajectory, from a continuous stream of video and language instructions. Our framework combines a streaming autoregressive architecture with an ROI-enhanced memory layer, capturing temporal context while focusing on salient hand-centric regions. To enable this research, we also introduce EgoHaFL, the first large-scale dataset featuring synchronized 3D hand poses and language instructions. We demonstrate that SFHand achieves new state-of-the-art results in 3D hand forecasting, outperforming prior work by a significant margin of up to 35.8%. Furthermore, we show the practical utility of our learned representations by transferring them to downstream embodied manipulation tasks, improving task success rates by up to 13.4% on multiple benchmarks.

However, as the scaling paradigm evolves, this paradigm encounters a fundamental challenge when applied to dynamic data streams characterized by concept drift - unpredictable changes in the underlying data distribution. This paper aims to advance robust pre-training under such non-stationary environments. We begin by revealing that conventional contrastive pre-training methods are highly susceptible to concept drift, resulting in significant substantial bias and instability within the learned feature representations. To systematically analyze these effects, we develop a structural causal model that elucidates how drift acts as a confounder, distorting the learned representations. Based on these causal insights, we propose Resilient Contrastive Pre-training (RCP), a novel method that incorporates causal intervention. RCP formulates a causally-informed objective to mitigate drift-induced biases through targeted interventions. The method is designed for simple and scalable implementation and exhibits notable adaptability, promoting robust and autonomous pre-training on non-stationary data. Comprehensive experiments across various downstream tasks consistently demonstrate that RCP effectively alleviates the detrimental impact of concept drift, yielding more resilient and generalizable representations.</p></details> | 17pages, 3 figures |

While recent methods based on vision-language models like CLIP show promise, their performance is constrained by existing prompt engineering strategies. Current approaches, whether relying on single fixed, learnable, or dense dynamic prompts, suffer from a representational bottleneck and are prone to overfitting on auxiliary data, failing to generalize to the complexity and diversity of unseen anomalies. To overcome these limitations, we propose $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$. Our core insight is that robust ZSAD requires a compositional approach to prompt learning. Instead of learning monolithic prompts, $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$ learns a pool of expert prompts, which serve as a basis set of composable semantic primitives, and a visually-guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically combine them for each instance. Our framework materializes this concept through a Visually-Guided Mixture of Prompt (VGMoP) that employs an image-gated sparse MoE to aggregate diverse normal and abnormal expert state prompts, generating semantically rich textual representations with strong generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets in industrial and medical domains demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures.

Existing methods primarily focus on image-level forgery detection, leaving generic video-level forgery detection largely underexplored. To advance video forensics, we propose a consolidated multimodal detection algorithm, named MM-Det++, specifically designed for detecting diffusion-generated videos. Our approach consists of two innovative branches and a Unified Multimodal Learning (UML) module. Specifically, the Spatio-Temporal (ST) branch employs a novel Frame-Centric Vision Transformer (FC-ViT) to aggregate spatio-temporal information for detecting diffusion-generated videos, where the FC-tokens enable the capture of holistic forgery traces from each video frame. In parallel, the Multimodal (MM) branch adopts a learnable reasoning paradigm to acquire Multimodal Forgery Representation (MFR) by harnessing the powerful comprehension and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which discerns the forgery traces from a flexible semantic perspective. To integrate multimodal representations into a coherent space, a UML module is introduced to consolidate the generalization ability of MM-Det++. In addition, we also establish a large-scale and comprehensive Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF) dataset to advance research in video forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MM-Det++ and highlight the effectiveness of unified multimodal forgery learning in detecting diffusion-generated videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/SparkleXFantasy/MM-Det-Plus</p></details> |

Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage massive pretraining data to support diverse manipulation tasks, but they still depend heavily on task-specific fine-tuning, revealing a lack of continual learning capability. Existing continual learning methods are also resource-intensive to scale to VLA models. We propose Stellar VLA, a knowledge-driven continual learning framework with two variants: T-Stellar, modeling task-centric knowledge space, and TS-Stellar, capturing hierarchical task-skill structure. Stellar VLA enables self-supervised knowledge evolution through joint learning of task latent representation and the knowledge space, reducing annotation needs. Knowledge-guided expert routing provide task specialization without extra network parameters, lowering training overhead.Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world tasks show over 50 percentage average improvement in final success rates relative to baselines. TS-Stellar further excels in complex action inference, and in-depth analyses verify effective knowledge retention and discovery. Our code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

Conventional physics models require detailed environmental knowledge, while stochastic replay methods are constrained by the limited diversity of measured channels and often fail to generalize to unseen scenarios, reducing their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose StableUASim, a pre-trained conditional latent diffusion surrogate model that captures the stochastic dynamics of underwater acoustic communication channels. Leveraging generative modeling, StableUASim produces diverse and statistically realistic channel realizations, while supporting conditional generation from specific measurement samples. Pre-training enables rapid adaptation to new environments using minimal additional data, and the autoencoder latent representation facilitates efficient channel analysis and compression. Experimental results demonstrate that StableUASim accurately reproduces key channel characteristics and communication performance, providing a scalable, data-efficient, and physically consistent surrogate model for both system design and machine learning-driven underwater applications.</p></details> |  |

Class Imbalance (CI) remains a fundamental challenge in FL, where rare but critical classes are often severely underrepresented in individual client datasets. Although prior work has addressed CI during training through reliable aggregation and local class distribution alignment, these methods typically rely on access to labeled data or coordination among clients, and none address class unsupervised adaptation to dynamic domains or distribution shifts at inference time under federated CI constraints. Revealing the failure of state-of-the-art TTA in federated client adaptation in CI scenario, we propose pFedBBN,a personalized federated test-time adaptation framework that employs balanced batch normalization (BBN) during local client adaptation to mitigate prediction bias by treating all classes equally, while also enabling client collaboration guided by BBN similarity, ensuring that clients with similar balanced representations reinforce each other and that adaptation remains aligned with domain-specific characteristics. pFedBBN supports fully unsupervised local adaptation and introduces a class-aware model aggregation strategy that enables personalized inference without compromising privacy. It addresses both distribution shifts and class imbalance through balanced feature normalization and domain-aware collaboration, without requiring any labeled or raw data from clients. Extensive experiments across diverse baselines show that pFedBBN consistently enhances robustness and minority-class performance over state-of-the-art FL and TTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 tables, 21 figures</p></details> |

Early detection is essential to prevent progression to invasive cervical adenocarcinoma. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based virtual pathology assistant capable of distinguishing AIS from normal cervical gland histology using the CAISHI dataset, which contains 2240 expert-labeled H&E images (1010 normal and 1230 AIS). All images underwent Macenko stain normalization and patch-based preprocessing to enhance morphological feature representation. An EfficientNet-B3 convolutional neural network was trained using class-balanced sampling and focal loss to address dataset imbalance and emphasize difficult examples. The final model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.7323, with an F1-score of 0.75 for the Abnormal class and 0.71 for the Normal class. Grad-CAM heatmaps demonstrated biologically interpretable activation patterns, highlighting nuclear atypia and glandular crowding consistent with AIS morphology. The trained model was deployed in a Gradio-based virtual diagnostic assistant. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight, interpretable AI systems for cervical gland pathology, with potential applications in screening workflows, education, and low-resource settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Semi-Supervised Active Learning for Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18058v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of deep learning models in remote sensing (RS) strongly depends on the availability of high-quality labeled data. However, collecting large-scale annotations is costly and time-consuming, while vast amounts of unlabeled imagery remain underutilized. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Semi-Supervised Active Learning (HSSAL) framework that integrates semi-supervised learning (SSL) and a novel hierarchical active learning (HAL) in a closed iterative loop. In each iteration, SSL refines the model using both labeled data through supervised learning and unlabeled data via weak-to-strong self-training, improving feature representation and uncertainty estimation. Guided by the refined representations and uncertainty cues of unlabeled samples, HAL then conducts sample querying through a progressive clustering strategy, selecting the most informative instances that jointly satisfy the criteria of scalability, diversity, and uncertainty. This hierarchical process ensures both efficiency and representativeness in sample selection. Extensive experiments on three benchmark RS scene classification datasets, including UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45, demonstrate that HSSAL consistently outperforms SSL- or AL-only baselines. Remarkably, with only 8%, 4%, and 2% labeled training data on UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45, respectively, HSSAL achieves over 95% of fully-supervised accuracy, highlighting its superior label efficiency through informativeness exploitation of unlabeled data. Our code will be released at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/RS-SSAL.</p></details> | Under review |

For simultaneous LDCT reconstruction and metal artifact reduction (LDMAR), existing deep learning-based efforts face two main limitations: i) the network design neglects multi-scale and within-scale information; ii) training a distinct model for each dose necessitates significant storage space for multiple doses. To fill these gaps, we propose a prompt guiding multi-scale adaptive sparse representation-driven network, abbreviated as PMSRNet, for LDMAR task. Specifically, we construct PMSRNet inspired from multi-scale sparsifying frames, and it can simultaneously employ within-scale characteristics and cross-scale complementarity owing to an elaborated prompt guiding scale-adaptive threshold generator (PSATG) and a built multi-scale coefficient fusion module (MSFuM). The PSATG can adaptively capture multiple contextual information to generate more faithful thresholds, achieved by fusing features from local, regional, and global levels. Furthermore, we elaborate a model interpretable dual domain LDMAR framework called PDuMSRNet, and train single model with a prompt guiding strategy for multiple dose levels. We build a prompt guiding module, whose input contains dose level, metal mask and input instance, to provide various guiding information, allowing a single model to accommodate various CT dose settings. Extensive experiments at various dose levels demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art LDMAR methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches mainly focus on directly enhancing the final resolution, often neglecting effective control over error propagation and accumulation during intermediate stages. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising approach that can represent the entire reconstruction process as a state sequence with multiple nodes, allowing for intermediate intervention. Nonetheless, its fixed linear mapper is limited by a narrow receptive field and restricted flexibility, which hampers its effectiveness in fine-grained images. To address this, we created a nonlinear state predictive control model \textbf{MambaX} that maps consecutive spectral bands into a latent state space and generalizes the SR task by dynamically learning the nonlinear state parameters of control equations. Compared to existing sequence models, MambaX 1) employs dynamic state predictive control learning to approximate the nonlinear differential coefficients of state-space models; 2) introduces a novel state cross-control paradigm for multimodal SR fusion; and 3) utilizes progressive transitional learning to mitigate heterogeneity caused by domain and modality shifts. Our evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of the dynamic spectrum-state representation model in both single-image SR and multimodal fusion-based SR tasks, highlighting its substantial potential to advance spectrally generalized modeling across arbitrary dimensions and modalities.</p></details> |  |

Our approach employs a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to reveal semantic structure within pretrained representations. In contrast to work on language models, monosemanticity in recommendation must preserve the interactions between separate user and item embeddings. To achieve this, we introduce a \emph{prediction aware} training objective that backpropagates through a frozen recommender and aligns the learned latent structure with the model's user-item affinity predictions. The resulting neurons capture properties such as genre, popularity, and temporal trends, and support post hoc control operations including targeted filtering and content promotion without modifying the base model. Our method generalizes across different recommendation models and datasets, providing a practical tool for interpretable and controllable personalization.

The primary challenges are narrowing the modality gap and leveraging spatiotemporal information in video sequences. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-modality feature learning framework named X-ReID for VVI-ReID. Specifically, we first propose a Cross-modality Prototype Collaboration (CPC) to align and integrate features from different modalities, guiding the network to reduce the modality discrepancy. Then, a Multi-granularity Information Interaction (MII) is designed, incorporating short-term interactions from adjacent frames, long-term cross-frame information fusion, and cross-modality feature alignment to enhance temporal modeling and further reduce modality gaps. Finally, by integrating multi-granularity information, a robust sequence-level representation is achieved. Extensive experiments on two large-scale VVI-ReID benchmarks (i.e., HITSZ-VCM and BUPTCampus) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

Current approaches naively bind static 3D Gaussians according to URDF links, forcing them to follow an URDF-rigged motion passively. However, real-world arm motion is noisy, and the idealized URDF-rigged motion cannot accurately model it, leading to severe rendering artifacts in 3D Gaussians. To address these challenges, we propose RoboArmGS, a novel hybrid representation that refines the URDF-rigged motion with learnable Bézier curves, enabling more accurate real-world motion modeling. To be more specific, we present a learnable Bézier Curve motion refiner that corrects per-joint residuals to address mismatches between real-world motion and URDF-rigged motion. RoboArmGS enables the learning of more accurate real-world motion while achieving a coherent binding of 3D Gaussians across arm parts. To support future research, we contribute a carefully collected dataset named RoboArm4D, which comprises several widely used robotic arms for evaluating the quality of building high-quality digital assets. We evaluate our approach on RoboArm4D, and RoboArmGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world motion modeling and rendering quality. The code and dataset will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[A multi-view contrastive learning framework for spatial embeddings in risk modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17954v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating spatial information, particularly those influenced by climate, weather, and demographic factors, is crucial for improving underwriting precision and enhancing risk management in insurance. However, spatial data are often unstructured, high-dimensional, and difficult to integrate into predictive models. Embedding methods are needed to convert spatial data into meaningful representations for modelling tasks. We propose a novel multi-view contrastive learning framework for generating spatial embeddings that combine information from multiple spatial data sources. To train the model, we construct a spatial dataset that merges satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap features across Europe. The framework aligns these spatial views with coordinate-based encodings, producing low-dimensional embeddings that capture both spatial structure and contextual similarity. Once trained, the model generates embeddings directly from latitude-longitude pairs, enabling any dataset with coordinates to be enriched with meaningful spatial features without requiring access to the original spatial inputs. In a case study on French real estate prices, we compare models trained on raw coordinates against those using our spatial embeddings as inputs. The embeddings consistently improve predictive accuracy across generalised linear, additive, and boosting models, while providing interpretable spatial effects and demonstrating transferability to unseen regions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Aspect Cross-modal Quantization for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15122v2)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in recommender systems. This approach relies on quantized representations to discretize item features, modeling users' historical interactions as sequences of discrete tokens. Based on these tokenized sequences, GR predicts the next item by employing next-token prediction methods. The challenges of GR lie in constructing high-quality semantic identifiers (IDs) that are hierarchically organized, minimally conflicting, and conducive to effective generative model training. However, current approaches remain limited in their ability to harness multimodal information and to capture the deep and intricate interactions among diverse modalities, both of which are essential for learning high-quality semantic IDs and for effectively training GR models. To address this, we propose Multi-Aspect Cross-modal quantization for generative Recommendation (MACRec), which introduces multimodal information and incorporates it into both semantic ID learning and generative model training from different aspects. Specifically, we first introduce cross-modal quantization during the ID learning process, which effectively reduces conflict rates and thus improves codebook usability through the complementary integration of multimodal information. In addition, to further enhance the generative ability of our GR model, we incorporate multi-aspect cross-modal alignments, including the implicit and explicit alignments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three well-known recommendation datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> |

With large language models and reinforcement learning (RL), strategy-based training offers new opportunities to jointly model these aspects. However, multimodal reasoning is more complex than unimodal reasoning, requiring accurate feature representation and cross-modal verification while facing scarce, high-quality annotations, which makes direct application of RL sub-optimal. We identify two key limitations of supervised fine-tuning plus RL (SFT+RL) for multimodal FAS: (1) limited multimodal reasoning paths restrict the use of complementary modalities and shrink the exploration space after SFT, weakening the effect of RL; and (2) mismatched single-task supervision versus diverse reasoning paths causes reasoning confusion, where models may exploit shortcuts by mapping images directly to answers and ignoring the intended reasoning. To address this, we propose PA-FAS, which enhances reasoning paths by constructing high-quality extended reasoning sequences from limited annotations, enriching paths and relaxing exploration constraints. We further introduce an answer-shuffling mechanism during SFT to force comprehensive multimodal analysis instead of using superficial cues, thereby encouraging deeper reasoning and mitigating shortcut learning. PA-FAS significantly improves multimodal reasoning accuracy and cross-domain generalization, and better unifies multimodal fusion, generalization, and interpretability for trustworthy FAS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> |

However, existing methods often require multiple evaluations of the forward mapping to generate a single sample, resulting in significant computational costs for large-scale inverse problems. To address this, we propose an unconditional representation of the conditional score function (UCoS) tailored to linear inverse problems, which avoids forward model evaluations during sampling by shifting computational effort to an offline training phase. In this phase, a \emph{task-dependent} score function is learned based on the linear forward operator. Crucially, we show that the conditional score can be derived \emph{exactly} from a trained (unconditional) score using affine transformations, eliminating the need for conditional score approximations. Our approach is formulated in infinite-dimensional function spaces, making it inherently discretization-invariant. We support this formulation with a rigorous convergence analysis that justifies UCoS beyond any specific discretization. Finally we validate UCoS through high-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and image deblurring experiments, demonstrating both scalability and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Decoupled Audio-Visual Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17890v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-Visual Dataset Distillation aims to compress large-scale datasets into compact subsets while preserving the performance of the original data. However, conventional Distribution Matching (DM) methods struggle to capture intrinsic cross-modal alignment. Subsequent studies have attempted to introduce cross-modal matching, but two major challenges remain: (i) independently and randomly initialized encoders lead to inconsistent modality mapping spaces, increasing training difficulty; and (ii) direct interactions between modalities tend to damage modality-specific (private) information, thereby degrading the quality of the distilled data. To address these challenges, we propose DAVDD, a pretraining-based decoupled audio-visual distillation framework. DAVDD leverages a diverse pretrained bank to obtain stable modality features and uses a lightweight decoupler bank to disentangle them into common and private representations. To effectively preserve cross-modal structure, we further introduce Common Intermodal Matching together with a Sample-Distribution Joint Alignment strategy, ensuring that shared representations are aligned both at the sample level and the global distribution level. Meanwhile, private representations are entirely isolated from cross-modal interaction, safeguarding modality-specific cues throughout distillation. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DAVDD achieves state-of-the-art results under all IPC settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of decoupled representation learning for high-quality audio-visual dataset distillation. Code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Model Predictive Control in Manufacturing Processes: A Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17865v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manufacturing processes are inherently dynamic and uncertain, with varying parameters and nonlinear behaviors, making robust control essential for maintaining quality and reliability. Traditional control methods often fail under these conditions due to their reactive nature. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a more advanced framework, leveraging process models to predict future states and optimize control actions. However, MPC relies on simplified models that often fail to capture complex dynamics, and it struggles with accurate state estimation and handling the propagation of uncertainty in manufacturing environments. Machine learning (ML) has been introduced to enhance MPC by modeling nonlinear dynamics and learning latent representations that support predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization. Yet existing ML-driven MPC approaches remain deterministic and correlation-focused, motivating the exploration of generative. Generative ML offers new opportunities by learning data distributions, capturing hidden patterns, and inherently managing uncertainty, thereby complementing MPC. This review highlights five representative methods and examines how each has been integrated into MPC components, including predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization. By synthesizing these cases, we outline the common ways generative ML can systematically enhance MPC and provide a framework for understanding its potential in diverse manufacturing processes. We identify key research gaps, propose future directions, and use a representative case to illustrate how generative ML-driven MPC can extend broadly across manufacturing. Taken together, this review positions generative ML not as an incremental add-on but as a transformative approach to reshape predictive control for next-generation manufacturing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, Review article</p></details> |

Despite their success on static images and short clips, current self-supervised learning methods often overlook the procedural nature that underpins such activities. We expose the lack of procedural awareness in current SSL methods with a motivating experiment: models pretrained on forward and time-reversed sequences produce highly similar features, confirming that their representations are blind to the underlying procedural order. To address this shortcoming, we propose PL-Stitch, a self-supervised framework that harnesses the inherent temporal order of video frames as a powerful supervisory signal. Our approach integrates two novel probabilistic objectives based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. The primary PL objective trains the model to sort sampled frames chronologically, compelling it to learn the global workflow progression. The secondary objective, a spatio-temporal jigsaw loss, complements the learning by capturing fine-grained, cross-frame object correlations. Our approach consistently achieves superior performance across five surgical and cooking benchmarks. Specifically, PL-Stitch yields significant gains in surgical phase recognition (e.g., +11.4 pp k-NN accuracy on Cholec80) and cooking action segmentation (e.g., +5.7 pp linear probing accuracy on Breakfast), demonstrating its effectiveness for procedural video representation learning.</p></details> | 18 pages |

As engineered systems grow in complexity, conventional FMEA methods, largely manual, document-centric, and expert-dependent, have become increasingly inadequate for addressing the demands of modern systems engineering. We examine how techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and natural language processing, can transform FMEA into a more dynamic, data-driven, intelligent, and model-integrated process by automating failure prediction, prioritisation, and knowledge extraction from operational data. In parallel, we explore the role of ontologies in formalising system knowledge, supporting semantic reasoning, improving traceability, and enabling cross-domain interoperability. The review also synthesises emerging hybrid approaches, such as ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, which further enhance explainability and automation. These developments are discussed within the broader context of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and function modelling, showing how AI and ontologies can support more adaptive and resilient FMEA workflows. We critically analyse a range of tools, case studies, and integration strategies, while identifying key challenges related to data quality, explainability, standardisation, and interdisciplinary adoption. By leveraging AI, systems engineering, and knowledge representation using ontologies, this review offers a structured roadmap for embedding FMEA within intelligent, knowledge-rich engineering environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is based on research undertaken by our doctoral student at the University of Bradford.

| **[Towards Open-Ended Visual Scientific Discovery with Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17735v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific archives now contain hundreds of petabytes of data across genomics, ecology, climate, and molecular biology that could reveal undiscovered patterns if systematically analyzed at scale. Large-scale, weakly-supervised datasets in language and vision have driven the development of foundation models whose internal representations encode structure (patterns, co-occurrences and statistical regularities) beyond their training objectives. Most existing methods extract structure only for pre-specified targets; they excel at confirmation but do not support open-ended discovery of unknown patterns. We ask whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can enable open-ended feature discovery from foundation model representations. We evaluate this question in controlled rediscovery studies, where the learned SAE features are tested for alignment with semantic concepts on a standard segmentation benchmark and compared against strong label-free alternatives on concept-alignment metrics. Applied to ecological imagery, the same procedure surfaces fine-grained anatomical structure without access to segmentation or part labels, providing a scientific case study with ground-truth validation. While our experiments focus on vision with an ecology case study, the method is domain-agnostic and applicable to models in other sciences (e.g., proteins, genomics, weather). Our results indicate that sparse decomposition provides a practical instrument for exploring what scientific foundation models have learned, an important prerequisite for moving from confirmation to genuine discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterfactual World Models via Digital Twin-conditioned Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17481v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models learn to predict the temporal evolution of visual observations given a control signal, potentially enabling agents to reason about environments through forward simulation. Because of the focus on forward simulation, current world models generate predictions based on factual observations. For many emerging applications, such as comprehensive evaluations of physical AI behavior under varying conditions, the ability of world models to answer counterfactual queries, such as "what would happen if this object was removed?", is of increasing importance. We formalize counterfactual world models that additionally take interventions as explicit inputs, predicting temporal sequences under hypothetical modifications to observed scene properties. Traditional world models operate directly on entangled pixel-space representations where object properties and relationships cannot be selectively modified. This modeling choice prevents targeted interventions on specific scene properties. We introduce CWMDT, a framework to overcome those limitations, turning standard video diffusion models into effective counterfactual world models. First, CWMDT constructs digital twins of observed scenes to explicitly encode objects and their relationships, represented as structured text. Second, CWMDT applies large language models to reason over these representations and predict how a counterfactual intervention propagates through time to alter the observed scene. Third, CWMDT conditions a video diffusion model with the modified representation to generate counterfactual visual sequences. Evaluations on two benchmarks show that the CWMDT approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, suggesting that alternative representations of videos, such as the digital twins considered here, offer powerful control signals for video forward simulation-based world models.</p></details> |  |

However, the field lacks a consolidated understanding of its security properties, adversarial resilience, and methodological consistency. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines CSI-based biometric authentication through a security lens, analyzing how existing works diverge in sensing infrastructure, signal representations, feature pipelines, learning models, and evaluation methodologies. Our synthesis reveals systemic inconsistencies: reliance on aggregate accuracy metrics, limited reporting of FAR/FRR/EER, absence of per-user risk analysis, and scarce consideration of threat models or adversarial feasibility. To this end, we construct a unified evaluation framework to expose these issues empirically and demonstrate how security-relevant metrics such as per-class EER, Frequency Count of Scores (FCS), and the Gini Coefficient uncover risk concentration that remains hidden under traditional reporting practices. The resulting analysis highlights concrete attack surfaces--including replay, geometric mimicry, and environmental perturbation--and shows how methodological choices materially influence vulnerability profiles. Based on these findings, we articulate the security boundaries of current CSI biometrics and provide guidelines for rigorous evaluation, reproducible experimentation, and future research directions. This SoK offers the security community a structured, evidence-driven reassessment of Wi-Fi CSI biometrics and their suitability as an authentication primitive.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was submitted to the 11th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (IEEE S&P 2026)</p></details> |

However, it remains underdiagnosed because current diagnostic methods depend heavily on subjective clinical assessments. To enable objective detection, we introduce a gold standard dataset of 103 clinically assessed participants collected through a tripartite data approach which uniquely integrated eye tracking data with audio and video to give a comprehensive representation of depressive symptoms. Eye tracking data quantifies the attentional bias towards negative stimuli that is frequently observed in depressed groups. Audio and video data capture the affective flattening and psychomotor retardation characteristic of depression. Statistical validation confirmed their significant discriminative power in distinguishing depressed from non depressed groups. We address a critical limitation of existing graph-based models that focus on low-frequency information and propose a Multi-Frequency Graph Convolutional Network (MF-GCN). This framework consists of a novel Multi-Frequency Filter Bank Module (MFFBM), which can leverage both low and high frequency signals. Extensive evaluation against traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning frameworks demonstrates that MF-GCN consistently outperforms baselines. In binary classification, the model achieved a sensitivity of 0.96 and F2 score of 0.94. For the 3 class classification task, the proposed method achieved a sensitivity of 0.79 and specificity of 0.87 and siginificantly suprassed other models. To validate generalizability, the model was also evaluated on the Chinese Multimodal Depression Corpus (CMDC) dataset and achieved a sensitivity of 0.95 and F2 score of 0.96. These results confirm that our trimodal, multi frequency framework effectively captures cross modal interaction for accurate depression detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Quranic Learning: A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach for Arabic Phoneme Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17477v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal deep learning have greatly enhanced the capability of systems for speech analysis and pronunciation assessment. Accurate pronunciation detection remains a key challenge in Arabic, particularly in the context of Quranic recitation, where subtle phonetic differences can alter meaning. Addressing this challenge, the present study proposes a transformer-based multimodal framework for Arabic phoneme mispronunciation detection that combines acoustic and textual representations to achieve higher precision and robustness. The framework integrates UniSpeech-derived acoustic embeddings with BERT-based textual embeddings extracted from Whisper transcriptions, creating a unified representation that captures both phonetic detail and linguistic context. To determine the most effective integration strategy, early, intermediate, and late fusion methods were implemented and evaluated on two datasets containing 29 Arabic phonemes, including eight hafiz sounds, articulated by 11 native speakers. Additional speech samples collected from publicly available YouTube recordings were incorporated to enhance data diversity and generalization. Model performance was assessed using standard evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, allowing a detailed comparison of the fusion strategies. Experimental findings show that the UniSpeech-BERT multimodal configuration provides strong results and that fusion-based transformer architectures are effective for phoneme-level mispronunciation detection. The study contributes to the development of intelligent, speaker-independent, and multimodal Computer-Aided Language Learning (CALL) systems, offering a practical step toward technology-supported Quranic pronunciation training and broader speech-based educational applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Physically Interpretable World Models via Weakly Supervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12870v5)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning predictive models from high-dimensional sensory observations is fundamental for cyber-physical systems, yet the latent representations learned by standard world models lack physical interpretability. This limits their reliability, generalizability, and applicability to safety-critical tasks. We introduce Physically Interpretable World Models (PIWM), a framework that aligns latent representations with real-world physical quantities and constrains their evolution through partially known physical dynamics. Physical interpretability in PIWM is defined by two complementary properties: (i) the learned latent state corresponds to meaningful physical variables, and (ii) its temporal evolution follows physically consistent dynamics. To achieve this without requiring ground-truth physical annotations, PIWM employs weak distribution-based supervision that captures state uncertainty naturally arising from real-world sensing pipelines. The architecture integrates a VQ-based visual encoder, a transformer-based physical encoder, and a learnable dynamics model grounded in known physical equations. Across three case studies (Cart Pole, Lunar Lander, and Donkey Car), PIWM achieves accurate long-horizon prediction, recovers true system parameters, and significantly improves physical grounding over purely data-driven models. These results demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of learning physically interpretable world models directly from images under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[InTAct: Interval-based Task Activation Consolidation for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17439v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning aims to enable neural networks to acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. While recent prompt-based methods perform strongly in class-incremental settings, they remain vulnerable under domain shifts, where the input distribution changes but the label space remains fixed. This exposes a persistent problem known as representation drift. Shared representations evolve in ways that overwrite previously useful features and cause forgetting even when prompts isolate task-specific parameters. To address this issue, we introduce InTAct, a method that preserves functional behavior in shared layers without freezing parameters or storing past data. InTAct captures the characteristic activation ranges associated with previously learned tasks and constrains updates to ensure the network remains consistent within these regions, while still allowing for flexible adaptation elsewhere. In doing so, InTAct stabilizes the functional role of important neurons rather than directly restricting parameter values. The approach is architecture-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing prompt-based continual learning frameworks. By regulating representation changes where past knowledge is encoded, InTAct achieves a principled balance between stability and plasticity. Across diverse domain-incremental benchmarks, including DomainNet and ImageNet-R, InTAct consistently reduces representation drift and improves performance, increasing Average Accuracy by up to 8 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

MVDPDPSR is an extension of the vehicle routing problem and a spatio-temporal system optimization problem, widely applied in scenarios such as on-demand delivery. Classical operations research methods face bottlenecks in computational complexity and time efficiency when handling large-scale dynamic problems. Although existing reinforcement learning methods have achieved some progress, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Independent decoding across multiple vehicles fails to model joint action distributions; 2) The feature extraction network struggles to capture inter-entity relationships; 3) The joint action space is exponentially large. To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration. Experiments on 8 datasets demonstrate that MAPT significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of performance and exhibits substantial computational time advantages compared to classical operations research methods.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning by Curvature Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17426v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently advanced through non-contrastive methods that couple an invariance term with variance, covariance, or redundancy-reduction penalties. While such objectives shape first- and second-order statistics of the representation, they largely ignore the local geometry of the underlying data manifold. In this paper, we introduce CurvSSL, a curvature-regularized self-supervised learning framework, and its RKHS extension, kernel CurvSSL. Our approach retains a standard two-view encoder-projector architecture with a Barlow Twins-style redundancy-reduction loss on projected features, but augments it with a curvature-based regularizer. Each embedding is treated as a vertex whose $k$ nearest neighbors define a discrete curvature score via cosine interactions on the unit hypersphere; in the kernel variant, curvature is computed from a normalized local Gram matrix in an RKHS. These scores are aligned and decorrelated across augmentations by a Barlow-style loss on a curvature-derived matrix, encouraging both view invariance and consistency of local manifold bending. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with a ResNet-18 backbone show that curvature-regularized SSL yields competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to Barlow Twins and VICReg. Our results indicate that explicitly shaping local geometry is a simple and effective complement to purely statistical SSL regularizers.</p></details> |  |
| **[DS-Span: Single-Phase Discriminative Subgraph Mining for Efficient Graph Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17419v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph representation learning seeks to transform complex, high-dimensional graph structures into compact vector spaces that preserve both topology and semantics. Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning. Yet, existing frequent or discriminative subgraph mining approaches often suffer from redundant multi-phase pipelines, high computational cost, and weak coupling between mined structures and their discriminative relevance. We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy. The resulting subgraph set serves as an efficient, interpretable basis for downstream graph embedding and classification. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that DS-Span generates more compact and discriminative subgraph features than prior multi-stage methods, achieving higher or comparable accuracy with significantly reduced runtime. These results highlight the potential of unified, single-phase discriminative mining as a foundation for scalable and interpretable graph representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feasibility of Embodied Dynamics Based Bayesian Learning for Continuous Pursuit Motion Control of Assistive Mobile Robots in the Built Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17401v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer an intuitive means for individuals with severe motor impairments to independently operate assistive robotic wheelchairs and navigate built environments. Despite considerable progress in BCI research, most current motion control systems are limited to discrete commands, rather than supporting continuous pursuit, where users can freely adjust speed and direction in real time. Such natural mobility control is, however, essential for wheelchair users to navigate complex public spaces, such as transit stations, airports, hospitals, and indoor corridors, to interact socially with the dynamic populations with agility, and to move flexibly and comfortably as autonomous driving is refined to allow movement at will. In this study, we address the gap of continuous pursuit motion control in BCIs by proposing and validating a brain-inspired Bayesian inference framework, where embodied dynamics in acceleration-based motor representations are decoded. This approach contrasts with conventional kinematics-level decoding and deep learning-based methods. Using a public dataset with sixteen hours of EEG from four subjects performing motor imagery-based target-following, we demonstrate that our method, utilizing Automatic Relevance Determination for feature selection and continual online learning, reduces the normalized mean squared error between predicted and true velocities by 72% compared to autoregressive and EEGNet-based methods in a session-accumulative transfer learning setting. Theoretically, these findings empirically support embodied cognition theory and reveal the brain's intrinsic motor control dynamics in an embodied and predictive nature. Practically, grounding EEG decoding in the same dynamical principles that govern biological motion offers a promising path toward more stable and intuitive BCI control.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 9 figures, and 7 tables</p></details> |

By leveraging complementary information across shared contextual cues, it enhances the discriminative evaluation of subtle intra-class variations in highly similar action sequences. However, partial modalities are frequently unavailable at the inference stage in reality. The absence of any modality often renders existing multimodal models inoperable. Furthermore, it triggers catastrophic performance degradation due to interruptions in cross-modal interactions. To address this issue, we propose a novel Missing Completion Framework with Mixture of Experts (MCMoE) that unifies unimodal and joint representation learning in single-stage training. Specifically, we propose an adaptive gated modality generator that dynamically fuses available information to reconstruct missing modalities. We then design modality experts to learn unimodal knowledge and dynamically mix the knowledge of all experts to extract cross-modal joint representations. With a mixture of experts, missing modalities are further refined and complemented. Finally, in the training phase, we mine the complete multimodal features and unimodal expert knowledge to guide modality generation and generation-based joint representation extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MCMoE achieves state-of-the-art results in both complete and incomplete multimodal learning on three public AQA benchmarks.

| **[MorphSeek: Fine-grained Latent Representation-Level Policy Optimization for Deformable Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17392v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deformable image registration (DIR) remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in medical image analysis, largely due to the prohibitively high-dimensional deformation space of dense displacement fields and the scarcity of voxel-level supervision. Existing reinforcement learning frameworks often project this space into coarse, low-dimensional representations, limiting their ability to capture spatially variant deformations. We propose MorphSeek, a fine-grained representation-level policy optimization paradigm that reformulates DIR as a spatially continuous optimization process in the latent feature space. MorphSeek introduces a stochastic Gaussian policy head atop the encoder to model a distribution over latent features, facilitating efficient exploration and coarse-to-fine refinement. The framework integrates unsupervised warm-up with weakly supervised fine-tuning through Group Relative Policy Optimization, where multi-trajectory sampling stabilizes training and improves label efficiency. Across three 3D registration benchmarks (OASIS brain MRI, LiTS liver CT, and Abdomen MR-CT), MorphSeek achieves consistent Dice improvements over competitive baselines while maintaining high label efficiency with minimal parameter cost and low step-level latency overhead. Beyond optimizer specifics, MorphSeek advances a representation-level policy learning paradigm that achieves spatially coherent and data-efficient deformation optimization, offering a principled, backbone-agnostic, and optimizer-agnostic solution for scalable visual alignment in high-dimensional settings.</p></details> |  |

A major bottleneck lies in the scarcity of large-scale, action-annotated data for dexterous skills, as teleoperation is difficult and costly. Human data, with its vast scale and diverse manipulation behaviors, provides rich priors for learning robotic actions. While prior works have explored leveraging human demonstrations, they are often constrained by limited scenarios and a large visual gap between human and robots. To eliminate these limitations, we propose METIS, a vision-language-action (VLA) model for dexterous manipulation pretrained on multi-source egocentric datasets. We first construct EgoAtlas, which integrates large-scale human and robotic data from multiple sources, all unified under a consistent action space. We further extract motion-aware dynamics, a compact and discretized motion representation, which provides efficient and expressive supervision for VLA training. Built upon them, METIS integrates reasoning and acting into a unified framework, enabling effective deployment to downstream dexterous manipulation tasks. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving highest average success rate in six real-world tasks. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings emphasize METIS as a promising step toward a generalist model for dexterous manipulation.</p></details> |  |

However, it treats all regions uniformly and independently, lacking an explicit notion of where or in what order predictions should be made. Inspired by human visual perception, which deploys attention selectively and sequentially from the most informative to secondary regions, we propose DSeq-JEPA, a Discriminative Sequential Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture that bridges predictive and autoregressive self-supervised learning, integrating JEPA-style latent prediction with GPT-style sequential reasoning. Specifically, DSeq-JEPA (i) first identifies primary discriminative regions based on a transformer-derived saliency map, emphasizing the distribution of visual importance, and then (ii) predicts subsequent regions in this discriminative order, progressively forming a curriculum-like semantic progression from primary to secondary cues -- a form of GPT-style pre-training. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including image classification (ImageNet), fine-grained visual categorization (iNaturalist21, CUB-200-2011, Stanford-Cars), detection and segmentation (MS-COCO, ADE20K), and low-level reasoning tasks (Clevr/Count, Clevr/Dist), demonstrate that DSeq-JEPA consistently focuses on more discriminative and generalizable representations than I-JEPA variants.

| **[ReBaPL: Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17339v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has emerged as an effective technique for fine-tuning large-scale foundation models for downstream tasks. However, conventional prompt tuning methods are prone to overfitting and can struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. To address these limitations, Bayesian prompt learning has been proposed, which frames prompt optimization as a Bayesian inference problem to enhance robustness. This paper introduces Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL), a novel method for Bayesian prompt learning, designed to efficiently explore the complex and often multimodal posterior landscape of prompts. Our method integrates a cyclical step-size schedule with a stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm, enabling alternating phases of exploration to discover new modes, and exploitation to refine existing modes. Furthermore, we introduce a repulsive force derived from a potential function over probability metrics (including Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) computed on the distributions of representations produced by different prompts. This representation-space repulsion diversifies exploration and prevents premature collapse to a single mode. Our approach allows for a more comprehensive characterization of the prompt posterior distribution, leading to improved generalization. In contrast to prior Bayesian prompt learning methods, our method provides a modular plug-and-play Bayesian extension of any existing prompt learning method based on maximum likelihood estimation. We demonstrate the efficacy of ReBaPL on several benchmark datasets, showing superior performance over state-of-the-art methods for prompt learning.</p></details> | Under review |

When scaled to large datasets, this paradigm has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the resulting trained models such as DINOv3 have seen widespread adoption. However, most prior efforts are optimized for semantic understanding rather than geometric reasoning. One important exception is Cross-View Completion, CroCo, which is a form of masked autoencoding (MAE) tailored for 3D understanding. In this work, we continue on the path proposed by CroCo and focus on learning features tailored for 3D vision. In a nutshell, we extend MAE to arbitrarily many views of the same scene. By uniformly masking all views and employing a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention, our approach is inherently simpler and more scalable than CroCo. We evaluate the resulting model, MuM, extensively on downstream tasks including feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching and relative pose estimation, finding that it outperforms the state-of-the-art visual encoders DINOv3 and CroCo v2.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolSight: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition with SMILES Pretraining, Multi-Granularity Learning and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17300v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) plays a pivotal role in modern chemical informatics, enabling the automated conversion of chemical structure images from scientific literature, patents, and educational materials into machine-readable molecular representations. This capability is essential for large-scale chemical data mining, drug discovery pipelines, and Large Language Model (LLM) applications in related domains. However, existing OCSR systems face significant challenges in accurately recognizing stereochemical information due to the subtle visual cues that distinguish stereoisomers, such as wedge and dash bonds, ring conformations, and spatial arrangements. To address these challenges, we propose MolSight, a comprehensive learning framework for OCSR that employs a three-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, we conduct pre-training on large-scale but noisy datasets to endow the model with fundamental perception capabilities for chemical structure images. In the second stage, we perform multi-granularity fine-tuning using datasets with richer supervisory signals, systematically exploring how auxiliary tasks-specifically chemical bond classification and atom localization-contribute to molecular formula recognition. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning for post-training optimization and introduce a novel stereochemical structure dataset. Remarkably, we find that even with MolSight's relatively compact parameter size, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm can further enhance the model's performance on stereomolecular. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, our results demonstrate that MolSight achieves state-of-the-art performance in (stereo)chemical optical structure recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Global Input Relevance and Enforcing Sparse Representations with a Scalable Spectral Neural Network Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01183v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In machine learning practice it is often useful to identify relevant input features. Isolating key input elements, ranked according their respective degree of relevance, can help to elaborate on the process of decision making. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the relative importance of the input components for a Deep Neural Network. This is achieved by leveraging on a spectral re-parametrization of the optimization process. Eigenvalues associated to input nodes provide in fact a robust proxy to gauge the relevance of the supplied entry features. Notably, the spectral features ranking is performed automatically, as a byproduct of the network training, with no additional processing to be carried out. Moreover, by leveraging on the regularization of the eigenvalues, it is possible to enforce solutions making use of a minimum subset of the input components, increasing the explainability of the model and providing sparse input representations. The technique is compared to the most common methods in the literature and is successfully challenged against both synthetic and real data.</p></details> |  |

Existing defenses predominantly rely on anomaly detection in parameter or gradient space, overlooking behavioral constraints that backdoor attacks must satisfy to ensure reliable trigger activation. These anomaly-centric methods fail against adaptive attacks that normalize update magnitudes and mimic benign statistical patterns while preserving backdoor functionality, creating a fundamental detection gap. To address this limitation, this paper introduces FeRA (Federated Representative Attention) -- a novel attention-driven defense that shifts the detection paradigm from anomaly-centric to consistency-centric analysis. FeRA exploits the intrinsic need for backdoor persistence across training rounds, identifying malicious clients through suppressed representation-space variance, an orthogonal property to traditional magnitude-based statistics. The framework conducts multi-dimensional behavioral analysis combining spectral and spatial attention, directional alignment, mutual similarity, and norm inflation across two complementary detection mechanisms: consistency analysis and norm-inflation detection. Through this mechanism, FeRA isolates malicious clients that exhibit low-variance consistency or magnitude amplification. Extensive evaluation across six datasets, nine attacks, and three model architectures under both Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID settings confirm FeRA achieves superior backdoor mitigation. Under different non-IID settings, FeRA achieved the lowest average Backdoor Accuracy (BA), about 1.67% while maintaining high clean accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art defenses.

It enables developers to implement function-level tasks, i.e., serverless functions, without managing infrastructure. While reducing operational overhead, it poses challenges, especially for novice developers. Developing functions from scratch requires adapting to heterogeneous, platform-specific programming styles, making the process time-consuming and error-prone. Function reuse offers a promising solution to address these challenges. However, research on serverless computing lacks a dedicated approach for function recommendation. Existing techniques from traditional contexts remain insufficient due to the semantic gap between task descriptions and heterogeneous function implementations. Advances in large language models (LLMs), pre-trained on large-scale corpora, create opportunities to bridge this gap by aligning developer requirements with function semantics. This paper presents SlsReuse, the first LLM-powered framework for serverless function reuse. Specifically, SlsReuse first constructs a reusable function repository serving as a foundational knowledge base. Then, it learns unified semantic-enhanced representations of heterogeneous functions through effective prompt engineering with few-shot prompting, capturing implicit code intent, target platforms, programming languages, and cloud services. Finally, given a natural language task query, SlsReuse performs intent-aware discovery combined with a multi-level pruning strategy and similarity matching. We evaluate SlsReuse on a curated dataset of 110 task queries. Built on ChatGPT-4o, one of the most representative LLMs, SlsReuse achieves Recall@10 of 91.20%, exceeding the state-of-the-art baseline by 24.53 percentage points.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a Multi-Layered Auditing Platform for Responsible AI that systematically evaluates cross-cultural value alignment in China-origin and Western-origin LLMs through four integrated methodologies: Ethical Dilemma Corpus for assessing temporal stability, Diversity-Enhanced Framework (DEF) for quantifying cultural fidelity, First-Token Probability Alignment for distributional accuracy, and Multi-stAge Reasoning frameworK (MARK) for interpretable decision-making. Our comparative analysis of 20+ leading models, such as Qwen, GPT-4o, Claude, LLaMA, and DeepSeek, reveals universal challenges-fundamental instability in value systems, systematic under-representation of younger demographics, and non-linear relationships between model scale and alignment quality-alongside divergent regional development trajectories. While China-origin models increasingly emphasize multilingual data integration for context-specific optimization, Western models demonstrate greater architectural experimentation but persistent U.S.-centric biases. Neither paradigm achieves robust cross-cultural generalization. We establish that Mistral-series architectures significantly outperform LLaMA3-series in cross-cultural alignment, and that Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning on diverse datasets surpasses Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback in preserving cultural variation...</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented on Academic Conference "Technology for Good: Driving Social Impact" (2025)</p></details> |

Since posts are user-generated, the image and text from the same post can express different or even contradictory sentiments, leading to potential \textbf{sentiment discrepancy}. However, existing works mainly adopt a single-branch fusion structure that primarily captures the consistent sentiment between image and text. The ignorance or implicit modeling of discrepant sentiment results in compromised unimodal encoding and limited performance. In this paper, we propose a semantics Completion and Decomposition (CoDe) network to resolve the above issue. In the semantics completion module, we complement image and text representations with the semantics of the in-image text, helping bridge the sentiment gap. In the semantics decomposition module, we decompose image and text representations with exclusive projection and contrastive learning, thereby explicitly capturing the discrepant sentiment between modalities. Finally, we fuse image and text representations by cross-attention and combine them with the learned discrepant sentiment for final classification. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of CoDe and the effectiveness of each proposed module.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

However, the PI capability constructed by the Continuous Attractor Neural Networks (CANNs) in most existing BIN studies exhibits significant computational redundancy, and its operational efficiency needs to be improved; otherwise, it will not be conducive to the practicality of BIN technology. To address this, this paper proposes an efficient PI approach using representation learning models to replicate CANN neurodynamic patterns. This method successfully replicates the neurodynamic patterns of CANN-modeled Head Direction Cells (HDCs) and Grid Cells (GCs) using lightweight Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These ANN-reconstructed HDC and GC models are then integrated to achieve brain-inspired PI for Dead Reckoning (DR). Benchmark tests in various environments, compared with the well-known NeuroSLAM system, demonstrate that this work not only accurately replicates the neurodynamic patterns of navigation cells but also matches NeuroSLAM in positioning accuracy. Moreover, efficiency improvements of approximately 17.5% on the general-purpose device and 40~50% on the edge device were observed, compared with NeuroSLAM. This work offers a novel implementation strategy to enhance the practicality of BIN technology and holds potential for further extension.</p></details> |  |

Since large-scale 3D annotation is prohibitively expensive, recent work explores self-supervised learning directly from sensor data without manual labels. Existing approaches either rely on 2D rendering consistency, where 3D structure emerges only implicitly, or on discretized voxel grids from accumulated lidar point clouds, limiting spatial precision and scalability. We introduce QueryOcc, a query-based self-supervised framework that learns continuous 3D semantic occupancy directly through independent 4D spatio-temporal queries sampled across adjacent frames. The framework supports supervision from either pseudo-point clouds derived from vision foundation models or raw lidar data. To enable long-range supervision and reasoning under constant memory, we introduce a contractive scene representation that preserves near-field detail while smoothly compressing distant regions. QueryOcc surpasses previous camera-based methods by 26% in semantic RayIoU on the self-supervised Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark while running at 11.6 FPS, demonstrating that direct 4D query supervision enables strong self-supervised occupancy learning. https://research.zenseact.com/publications/queryocc/</p></details> |  |

Our Self-Supervised & Cross-Modal Pretraining for CT Representation Extraction (SPECTRE) approach utilizes scalable 3D Vision Transformer architectures and modern self-supervised and vision-language pretraining strategies to learn general-purpose CT representations. Volumetric CT poses unique challenges, such as extreme token scaling, geometric anisotropy, and weak or noisy clinical supervision, that make standard transformer and contrastive learning recipes ineffective out of the box. The framework jointly optimizes a local transformer for high-resolution volumetric feature extraction and a global transformer for whole-scan context modeling, making large-scale 3D attention computationally tractable. Notably, SPECTRE is trained exclusively on openly available CT datasets, demonstrating that high-performing, generalizable representations can be achieved without relying on private data. Pretraining combines DINO-style self-distillation with SigLIP-based vision-language alignment using paired radiology reports, yielding features that are both geometrically consistent and clinically meaningful. Across multiple CT benchmarks, SPECTRE consistently outperforms prior CT foundation models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, establishing SPECTRE as a scalable, open, and fully transformer-based foundation model for 3D medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

While prior works have demonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic representations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics. This oversight often leads to significant performance degradation in tasks like object recognition and compromises their biological fidelity. To address this, we leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture spike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the hierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual cortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our results show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features across simulated visual cortical areas. While introducing topography typically leads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture exhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1 accuracy, compared to a 3% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the best-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in brain-likeness. We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates efficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in TDSNNs, contributing to model robustness. These findings suggest that TDSNNs offer a compelling balance between computational performance and brain-like features, providing not only a framework for interpreting neural science phenomena but also novel insights for designing more efficient and robust deep learning models.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 (Oral) |

We find that existing video recapture methods suffer from suboptimal camera motion injection strategies; such suboptimal designs not only limit camera control precision but also result in generated videos that fail to preserve fine visual details from the source video. To achieve more accurate and flexible motion manipulation, PostCam introduces a query-shared cross-attention module. It integrates two distinct forms of control signals: the 6-DoF camera poses and the 2D rendered video frames. By fusing them into a unified representation within a shared feature space, our model can extract underlying motion cues, which enhances both control precision and generation quality. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: the model first learns coarse camera control from pose inputs, and then incorporates visual information to refine motion accuracy and enhance visual fidelity. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that PostCam outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 20% in camera control precision and view consistency, while achieving the highest video generation quality.

| **[Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) Model for Integrating Statistical and Semantic Features in News Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17184v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>News text classification is a crucial task in natural language processing, essential for organizing and filtering the massive volume of digital content. Traditional methods typically rely on statistical features like term frequencies or TF-IDF values, which are effective at capturing word-level importance but often fail to reflect contextual meaning. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches utilize semantic features to understand word usage within context, yet they may overlook simple, high-impact statistical indicators. This paper introduces an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features in a unified framework. The model applies an attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type, enabling more informed classification decisions. Through evaluation on benchmark news datasets, the AGFF model demonstrates superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models. The results confirm that strategic integration of diverse feature types can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the fusion process. The findings highlight the model's ability to balance and exploit the complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations, making it a practical and effective solution for real-world news classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior work that uses these features in isolation or buried within complex architectures, we systematically evaluate them across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content). We assess three key dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability of encoded information, and cross-modal complementarity. We find that most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information, and that this information is complementary. Moreover, models primarily attend to semantically meaningful regions rather than spurious artifacts. Yet none generalize reliably across datasets. This generalization failure likely stems from dataset characteristics, not from the features themselves latching onto superficial patterns. These results expose both the promise and fundamental challenges of self-supervised representations for deepfake detection: while they learn meaningful patterns, achieving robust cross-domain performance remains elusive.</p></details> |  |

However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration. Through extensive experiments across three public ST datasets, DKAN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, establishing a new benchmark for spatial gene expression prediction and offering a powerful tool for advancing biological and clinical research.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 Oral, extended version</p></details> |

With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI'26 |

This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib.

However, recent Vision-Language-Action models focus on direct action prediction and earlier progress methods predict numeric achievements; both overlook the monotonic co-progression property of the observation and instruction sequences. Building on this insight, Progress-Think introduces semantic progress reasoning, predicting instruction-style progress from visual observations to enable more accurate navigation. To achieve this without expensive annotations, we propose a three-stage framework. In the initial stage, Self-Aligned Progress Pretraining bootstraps a reasoning module via a novel differentiable alignment between visual history and instruction prefixes. Then, Progress-Guided Policy Pretraining injects learned progress states into the navigation context, guiding the policy toward consistent actions. Finally, Progress-Policy Co-Finetuning jointly optimizes both modules with tailored progress-aware reinforcement objectives. Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show state-of-the-art success and efficiency, demonstrating that semantic progress yields a more consistent representation of navigation advancement.</p></details> |  |

Existing methodologies typically treat molecular captioning (molecule-to-text) and text-based molecular design (text-to-molecule) as separate tasks, relying on supervised fine-tuning or contrastive learning pipelines. These approaches face three key limitations: (i) conventional metrics like BLEU prioritize linguistic fluency over chemical accuracy, (ii) training datasets frequently contain chemically ambiguous narratives with incomplete specifications, and (iii) independent optimization of generation directions leads to bidirectional inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose RTMol, a bidirectional alignment framework that unifies molecular captioning and text-to-SMILES generation through self-supervised round-trip learning. The framework introduces novel round-trip evaluation metrics and enables unsupervised training for molecular captioning without requiring paired molecule-text corpora. Experiments demonstrate that RTMol enhances bidirectional alignment performance by up to 47% across various LLMs, establishing an effective paradigm for joint molecule-text understanding and generation.</p></details> |  |

In this article, an OSDG framework for hyperspectral image classification is proposed, centered on a new Spectral-Spatial Uncertainty Disentanglement mechanism. It has been designed to address the domain shift influencing both spectral, spatial and combined feature extraction pathways using evidential deep learning, after which the most reliable pathway for each sample is adaptively selected. The proposed framework is further integrated with frequency-domain feature extraction for domain-invariant representation learning, dual-channel residual networks for spectral-spatial feature extraction, and evidential deep learning based uncertainty quantification. Experiments conducted on three cross scene hyperspectral datasets, show that performance comparable to state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods can be achieved despite no access to target data, while high unknown-class rejection and known-class accuracy levels are maintained. The implementation will be available at github.com/amir-khb/UGOSDG upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Existing CNN-Transformer hybrids rely on static computation graphs with fixed routing, which consequently causes redundant computation and limits their adaptability to input variability. We propose Shape-Adapting Gated Experts (SAGE), an input-adaptive framework that enables dynamic expert routing in heterogeneous visual networks. SAGE reconfigures static backbones into dynamically routed expert architectures. SAGE's dual-path design features a backbone stream that preserves representation and selectively activates an expert path through hierarchical gating. This gating mechanism operates at multiple hierarchical levels, performing a two-level, hierarchical selection between shared and specialized experts to modulate model logits for Top-K activation. Our Shape-Adapting Hub (SA-Hub) harmonizes structural and semantic representations across the CNN and the Transformer module, effectively bridging diverse modules. Embodied as SAGE-UNet, our model achieves superior segmentation on three medical benchmarks: EBHI, DigestPath, and GlaS, yielding state-of-the-art Dice Scores of 95.57%, 95.16%, and 94.17%, respectively, and robustly generalizes across domains by adaptively balancing local refinement and global context. SAGE provides a scalable foundation for dynamic expert routing, enabling flexible visual reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, crystal representation methods characterize the structure using descriptors such as lattice parameters, symmetry, and space groups. However, in reality, atoms in materials always vibrate above absolute zero, causing their positions to fluctuate continuously. This dynamic behavior disrupts the fundamental periodicity of the lattice, making crystal graphs based on static lattice parameters and conventional descriptors discontinuous under slight perturbations. Chemists proposed the pairwise distance distribution (PDD) method to address this problem. However, the completeness of PDD requires defining a large number of neighboring atoms, leading to high computational costs. Additionally, PDD does not account for atomic information, making it challenging to apply it directly to crystal material property prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the atom-Weighted Pairwise Distance Distribution (WPDD) and Unit cell Pairwise Distance Distribution (UPDD) and apply them to the construction of multi-edge crystal graphs. We demonstrate the continuity and general completeness of crystal graphs under slight atomic position perturbations. Moreover, by modeling PDD as global information and integrating it into matrix-based message passing, we significantly reduce computational costs. Comprehensive evaluation results show that WPDDFormer achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across tasks on benchmark datasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS-DFT.</p></details> | 15pages,8 figures |

Equivariance is formulated as naturality in a topological category with Radon measures, formulating linear and nonlinear layers in the categorical setup. We prove the equivariant universal approximation theorem in the general setting: the class of finite-depth CENNs is dense in the space of continuous equivariant transformations. We instantiate the framework for groups/groupoids, posets/lattices, graphs and cellular sheaves, deriving universal approximation theorems for them in a systematic manner. Categorical equivariant deep learning thus allows us to expand the horizons of equivariant deep learning beyond group actions, encompassing not only geometric symmetries but also contextual and compositional symmetries.</p></details> |  |

We propose a matroidal generalization of the problem to oriented matroids, concerning exchange sequences between bases under sign constraints on elements appearing in certain fundamental circuits. We formulate a conjecture on the minimum length of such a sequence, and prove it for oriented graphic matroids of directed graphs. We also study connections between our conjecture and several long-standing open problems on exchange sequences between pairs of bases in unoriented matroids.</p></details> |  |

We present a new framework, KGpipe for defining and executing integration pipelines that can combine existing tools or LLM (Large Language Model) functionality. To evaluate different pipelines and the resulting KGs, we propose a benchmark to integrate heterogeneous data of different formats (RDF, JSON, text) into a seed KG. We demonstrate the flexibility of KGpipe by running and comparatively evaluating several pipelines integrating sources of the same or different formats using selected performance and quality metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 KG...</summary><p>15 KG pipelines (9 single source, 6 multi source)</p></details> |

In the present work, a first-of-its-kind multiscale graph transformer approach is developed for mesh-based super-resolution (SR-GT) of reacting flows. The novel data-driven modeling paradigm leverages a graph-based flow-field representation compatible with complex geometries and non-uniform/unstructured grids. Further, the transformer backbone captures long-range dependencies between different parts of the low-resolution flow-field, identifies important features, and then generates the super-resolved flow-field that preserves those features at a higher resolution. The performance of SR-GT is demonstrated in the context of spectral-element-discretized meshes for a challenging test problem of 2D detonation propagation within a premixed hydrogen-air mixture exhibiting highly complex multiscale reacting flow behavior. The SR-GT framework utilizes a unique element + neighborhood graph representation for the coarse input, which is then tokenized before being processed by the transformer component to produce the fine output. It is demonstrated that SR-GT provides high super-resolution accuracy for reacting flow-field features and superior performance compared to traditional interpolation-based SR schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Graph Navigation for Intelligent Subgraph Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17939v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph matching, a cornerstone of relational pattern detection in domains ranging from biochemical systems to social network analysis, faces significant computational challenges due to the dramatically growing search space. Existing methods address this problem within a filtering-ordering-enumeration framework, in which the enumeration stage recursively matches the query graph against the candidate subgraphs of the data graph. However, the lack of awareness of subgraph structural patterns leads to a costly brute-force enumeration, thereby critically motivating the need for intelligent navigation in subgraph matching. To address this challenge, we propose Neural Graph Navigation (NeuGN), a neuro-heuristic framework that transforms brute-force enumeration into neural-guided search by integrating neural navigation mechanisms into the core enumeration process. By preserving heuristic-based completeness guarantees while incorporating neural intelligence, NeuGN significantly reduces the \textit{First Match Steps} by up to 98.2\% compared to state-of-the-art methods across six real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient LLM-aware Heterogeneous Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17923v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs are widely present in real-world complex networks, where the diversity of node and relation types leads to complex and rich semantics. Efforts for modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs are restricted by the limitations of predefined semantic dependencies and the scarcity of supervised signals. The advanced pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm leverages graph structure to provide rich self-supervised signals, but introduces semantic gaps between tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential to address the semantic issues of relations and tasks in heterogeneous graphs through their strong reasoning capabilities in textual modality, but their incorporation into heterogeneous graphs is largely limited by computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Efficient LLM-Aware (ELLA) framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the above issues. To capture complex relation semantics, we propose an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer that leverages LLM to encode multi-hop, multi-type relations. To reduce computational complexity, we further employ a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer, which help reduces the complexity of LLM-aware relation reasoning from exponential to linear. To bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we introduce the fine-grained task-aware textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Extensive experiments on four heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed ELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the performance and efficiency. In particular, ELLA scales up to 13b-parameter LLMs and achieves up to a 4x speedup compared with existing LLM-based methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/l-wd/ELLA.</p></details> |  |
| **[INT-DTT+: Low-Complexity Data-Dependent Transforms for Video Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17867v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete trigonometric transforms (DTTs), such as the DCT-2 and the DST-7, are widely used in video codecs for their balance between coding performance and computational efficiency. In contrast, data-dependent transforms, such as the Karhunen-Loève transform (KLT) and graph-based separable transforms (GBSTs), offer better energy compaction but lack symmetries that can be exploited to reduce computational complexity. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a general framework to design low-complexity data-dependent transforms. Our approach builds on DTT+, a family of GBSTs derived from rank-one updates of the DTT graphs, which can adapt to signal statistics while retaining a structure amenable to fast computation. We first propose a graph learning algorithm for DTT+ that estimates the rank-one updates for rows and column graphs jointly, capturing the statistical properties of the overall block. Then, we exploit the progressive structure of DTT+ to decompose the kernel into a base DTT and a structured Cauchy matrix. By leveraging low-complexity integer DTTs and sparsifying the Cauchy matrix, we construct an integer approximation to DTT+, termed INT-DTT+. This approximation significantly reduces both computational and memory complexities with respect to the separable KLT with minimal performance loss. We validate our approach in the context of mode-dependent transforms for the VVC standard, following a rate-distortion optimized transform (RDOT) design approach. Integrated into the explicit multiple transform selection (MTS) framework of VVC in a rate-distortion optimization setup, INT-DTT+ achieves more than 3% BD-rate savings over the VVC MTS baseline, with complexity comparable to the integer DCT-2 once the base DTT coefficients are available.</p></details> |  |

These models are trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also present experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of larger warehouses operation datasets as the models are scaled up.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning. Yet, existing frequent or discriminative subgraph mining approaches often suffer from redundant multi-phase pipelines, high computational cost, and weak coupling between mined structures and their discriminative relevance. We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy. The resulting subgraph set serves as an efficient, interpretable basis for downstream graph embedding and classification. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that DS-Span generates more compact and discriminative subgraph features than prior multi-stage methods, achieving higher or comparable accuracy with significantly reduced runtime. These results highlight the potential of unified, single-phase discriminative mining as a foundation for scalable and interpretable graph representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Clustering with Side Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17326v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the graph clustering problem with a planted solution, the input is a graph on $n$ vertices partitioned into $k$ clusters, and the task is to infer the clusters from graph structure. A standard assumption is that clusters induce well-connected subgraphs (i.e. $Ω(1)$-expanders), and form $ε$-sparse cuts. Such a graph defines the clustering uniquely up to $\approx ε$ misclassification rate, and efficient algorithms for achieving this rate are known. While this vanilla version of graph clustering is well studied, in practice, vertices of the graph are typically equipped with labels that provide additional information on cluster ids of the vertices. For example, each vertex could have a cluster label that is corrupted independently with probability $δ$. Using only one of the two sources of information leads to misclassification rate $\min\{ε, δ\}$, but can they be combined to achieve a rate of $\approx εδ$? In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to this question and present a sublinear-time algorithm in the number of vertices $n$. Our key algorithmic insight is a new observation on ``spectrally ambiguous'' vertices in a well-clusterable graph. While our sublinear-time classifier achieves the nearly optimal $\approx \widetilde O(εδ)$ misclassification rate, the approximate clusters that it outputs do not necessarily induce expanders in the graph $G$. In our second result, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that reweights edges of the original $(k, ε, Ω(1))$-clusterable graph to transform it into a $(k, \widetilde O(εδ), Ω(1))$-clusterable one (for constant $k$), improving sparsity of cuts nearly optimally and preserving expansion properties of the communities - an algorithm for refining community structure of the input graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The arxiv landing page contains a shortened abstract</p></details> |

Existing methods mainly focus on modifying the timbre, rhythm, harmony, or instrumentation to mimic genres or artists, overlooking the diverse hardware properties of the playback device (i.e., speaker). Therefore, we propose DeMT, which processes a speaker's frequency response curve as a line graph using a vision-language model to extract device embeddings. These embeddings then condition a hybrid transformer via feature-wise linear modulation. Fine-tuned on a self-collected dataset, DeMT enables effective speaker-style transfer and robust few-shot adaptation for unseen devices, supporting applications like device-style augmentation and quality enhancement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Vision to Language: Annotation-Free Multimodal Knowledge Graph Construction for Enhanced LLMs Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12972v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) struggles with incomplete knowledge and hallucination artifacts, challenges that textual Knowledge Graphs (KGs) only partially mitigate due to their modality isolation. While Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) promise enhanced cross-modal understanding, their practical construction is impeded by semantic narrowness of manual text annotations and inherent noise in visual-semantic entity linkages. In this paper, we propose Vision-align-to-Language integrated Knowledge Graph (VaLiK), a novel approach for constructing MMKGs that enhances LLMs reasoning through cross-modal information supplementation. Specifically, we cascade pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align image features with text, transforming them into descriptions that encapsulate image-specific information. Furthermore, we developed a cross-modal similarity verification mechanism to quantify semantic consistency, effectively filtering out noise introduced during feature alignment. Even without manually annotated image captions, the refined descriptions alone suffice to construct the MMKG. Compared to conventional MMKGs construction paradigms, our approach achieves substantial storage efficiency gains while maintaining direct entity-to-image linkage capability. Experimental results on multimodal reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMs augmented with VaLiK outperform previous state-of-the-art models.

The issues of irrelevant facial movements and the challenge of detecting subtle motions in micro-expressions remain unresolved, hindering accurate expression spotting. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for facial expression spotting. First, we propose a Sliding Window-based multi-temporal-resolution Optical flow (SW-MRO) feature, which calculates multi-temporal-resolution optical flow of the input image sequence within compact sliding windows. The window length is tailored to perceive complete micro-expressions and distinguish between general macro- and micro-expressions. SW-MRO can effectively reveal subtle motions while avoiding the optical flow being dominated by head movements. Second, we propose SpotFormer, a multi-scale spatio-temporal Transformer that simultaneously encodes spatio-temporal relationships of the SW-MRO features for accurate frame-level probability estimation. In SpotFormer, we use the proposed Facial Local Graph Pooling (FLGP) operation and convolutional layers to extract multi-scale spatio-temporal features. We show the validity of the architecture of SpotFormer by comparing it with several model variants. Third, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into SpotFormer to enhance the discriminability between different types of expressions.

| **[Token Adaptation via Side Graph Convolution for Efficient Fine-tuning of 3D Point Cloud Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14142v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained 3D point cloud Transformers has emerged as a promising technique for 3D point cloud analysis. While existing PEFT methods attempt to minimize the number of tunable parameters, they often suffer from high temporal and spatial computational costs during fine-tuning. This paper proposes a novel PEFT algorithm called Side Token Adaptation on a neighborhood Graph (STAG) to achieve superior temporal and spatial efficiency. STAG employs a graph convolutional side network operating in parallel with a frozen backbone Transformer to adapt tokens to downstream tasks. Through efficient graph convolution, parameter sharing, and reduced gradient computation, STAG significantly reduces both temporal and spatial costs for fine-tuning. We also present Point Cloud Classification 13 (PCC13), a new benchmark comprising diverse publicly available 3D point cloud datasets to facilitate comprehensive evaluation. Extensive experiments using multiple pre-trained models and PCC13 demonstrates the effectiveness of STAG. Specifically, STAG maintains classification accuracy comparable to existing methods while reducing tunable parameters to only 0.43M and achieving significant reductions in both computation time and memory consumption for fine-tuning. Code and benchmark will be available at: https://github.com/takahikof/STAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Surgical Scene Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16430v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses. Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks. Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures. Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework recipe for weed detection that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build robustness to multiple field conditions. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data. Experimental results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The proposed model architecture enables local, global, and relational feature representations and offers high interpretability and adaptability. Practically, the framework allows real-time, efficient deployment of edge devices for automated weed detecting, reducing over-reliance on herbicides and providing scalable, sustainable precision-farming options.</p></details> |  |
| **[Angular Graph Fractional Fourier Transform: Theory and Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16111v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph spectral representations are fundamental in graph signal processing, offering a rigorous framework for analyzing and processing graph-structured data. The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) extends the classical graph Fourier transform (GFT) with a fractional-order parameter, enabling flexible spectral analysis while preserving mathematical consistency. The angular graph Fourier transform (AGFT) introduces angular control via GFT eigenvector rotation; however, existing constructions fail to degenerate to the GFT at zero angle, which is a critical flaw that undermines theoretical consistency and interpretability. To resolve these complementary limitations - GFRFT's lack of angular regulation and AGFT's defective degeneracy - this study proposes an angular GFRFT (AGFRFT), a unified framework that integrates fractional-order and angular spectral analyses with theoretical rigor. A degeneracy-friendly rotation matrix family ensures exact GFT degeneration at zero angle, with two AGFRFT variants (I-AGFRFT and II-AGFRFT) defined accordingly. Rigorous theoretical analyses confirm their unitarity, invertibility, and smooth parameter dependence. Both support learnable joint parameterization of the angle and fractional order, enabling adaptive spectral processing for diverse graph signals. Extensive experiments on real-world data denoising, image denoising, and point cloud denoising demonstrate that AGFRFT outperforms GFRFT and AGFT in terms of spectral concentration, reconstruction quality, and controllable spectral manipulation, establishing a robust and flexible tool for integrated angular fractional spectral analysis in graph signal processing.</p></details> |  |

Existing frameworks for museum information systems struggle to integrate heterogeneous metadata, unstructured documents, and multimodal artefacts into a coherent and queryable form. We present MuseKG, an end-to-end knowledge-graph framework that unifies structured and unstructured museum data through symbolic-neural integration. MuseKG constructs a typed property graph linking objects, people, organisations, and visual or textual labels, and supports natural language queries. Evaluations on real museum collections demonstrate robust performance across queries over attributes, relations, and related entities, surpassing large-language-model zero-shot, few-shot and SPARQL prompt baselines. The results highlight the importance of symbolic grounding for interpretable and scalable cultural heritage reasoning, and pave the way for web-scale integration of digital heritage knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Environmental Claim Detection with Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13628v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer based models, especially large language models (LLMs) dominate the field of NLP with their mass adoption in tasks such as text generation, summarization and fake news detection. These models offer ease of deployment and reliability for most applications, however, they require significant amounts of computational power for training as well as inference. This poses challenges in their adoption in resource-constrained applications, especially in the open-source community where compute availability is usually scarce. This work proposes a graph-based approach for Environmental Claim Detection, exploring Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) as lightweight yet effective alternatives to transformer-based models. Re-framing the task as a graph classification problem, we transform claim sentences into dependency parsing graphs, utilizing a combination of word2vec \& learnable part-of-speech (POS) tag embeddings for the node features and encoding syntactic dependencies in the edge relations. Our results show that our graph-based models, particularly HGNNs in the poincaré space (P-HGNNs), achieve performance superior to the state-of-the-art on environmental claim detection while using up to \textbf{30x fewer parameters}. We also demonstrate that HGNNs benefit vastly from explicitly modeling data in hierarchical (tree-like) structures, enabling them to significantly improve over their euclidean counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[TopoTune : A Framework for Generalized Combinatorial Complex Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06530v5)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively learn from relational data by leveraging graph symmetries. However, many real-world systems -- such as biological or social networks -- feature multi-way interactions that GNNs fail to capture. Topological Deep Learning (TDL) addresses this by modeling and leveraging higher-order structures, with Combinatorial Complex Neural Networks (CCNNs) offering a general and expressive approach that has been shown to outperform GNNs. However, TDL lacks the principled and standardized frameworks that underpin GNN development, restricting its accessibility and applicability. To address this issue, we introduce Generalized CCNNs (GCCNs), a simple yet powerful family of TDL models that can be used to systematically transform any (graph) neural network into its TDL counterpart. We prove that GCCNs generalize and subsume CCNNs, while extensive experiments on a diverse class of GCCNs show that these architectures consistently match or outperform CCNNs, often with less model complexity. In an effort to accelerate and democratize TDL, we introduce TopoTune, a lightweight software for defining, building, and training GCCNs with unprecedented flexibility and ease.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Retinal Disease Prediction Using Biology-Informed Heterogeneous Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16697v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretability is crucial to enhance trust in machine learning models for medical diagnostics. However, most state-of-the-art image classifiers based on neural networks are not interpretable. As a result, clinicians often resort to known biomarkers for diagnosis, although biomarker-based classification typically performs worse than large neural networks. This work proposes a method that surpasses the performance of established machine learning models while simultaneously improving prediction interpretability for diabetic retinopathy staging from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images. Our method is based on a novel biology-informed heterogeneous graph representation that models retinal vessel segments, intercapillary areas, and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in a human-interpretable way. This graph representation allows us to frame diabetic retinopathy staging as a graph-level classification task, which we solve using an efficient graph neural network. We benchmark our method against well-established baselines, including classical biomarker-based classifiers, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and vision transformers. Our model outperforms all baselines on two datasets. Crucially, we use our biology-informed graph to provide explanations of unprecedented detail. Our approach surpasses existing methods in precisely localizing and identifying critical vessels or intercapillary areas. In addition, we give informative and human-interpretable attributions to critical characteristics. Our work contributes to the development of clinical decision-support tools in ophthalmology.</p></details> |  |

Today, ZX-calculus, a computing model for quantum circuit transformation, is attracting attention for its highly abstract graph-based approach. Whereas existing tools such as PyZX and Quantomatic offer domain-specific support for quantum circuit optimization, visualization and theorem-proving, we present a complementary approach using LMNtal, a general-purpose hierarchical graph rewriting language, to establish a diagrammatic transformation and verification platform with model checking. Our methodology shows three advantages: (1) manipulation of ZX-diagrams through native graph transformation rules, enabling direct implementation of basic rules; (2) quantified pattern matching via QLMNtal extensions, greatly simplifying rule specification; and (3) interactive visualization and validation of optimization paths through state space exploration. Through case studies, we demonstrate how our framework helps understand optimization paths and design new algorithms and strategies. This suggests that the declarative language LMNtal and its toolchain could serve as a new platform to investigate quantum circuit transformation from a different perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 27 figures.

| **[SkyEgg: Joint Implementation Selection and Scheduling for Hardware Synthesis using E-graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15323v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware synthesis from high-level descriptions remains fundamentally limited by the sequential optimization of interdependent design decisions. Current methodologies, including state-of-the-art high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, artificially separate implementation selection from scheduling, leading to suboptimal designs that cannot fully exploit modern FPGA heterogeneous architectures. Implementation selection is typically performed by ad-hoc pattern matching on operations, a process that does not consider the impact on scheduling. Subsequently, scheduling algorithms operate on fixed selection solutions with inaccurate delay estimates, which misses critical optimization opportunities from appropriately configured FPGA blocks like DSP slices. We present SkyEgg, a novel hardware synthesis framework that jointly optimizes implementation selection and scheduling using the e-graph data structure. Our key insight is that both algebraic transformations and hardware implementation choices can be uniformly represented as rewrite rules within an e-graph, modeling the complete design space of implementation candidates to be selected and scheduled together. First, SkyEgg constructs an e-graph from the input program. It then applies both algebraic and implementation rewrites through equality saturation. Finally, it formulates the joint optimization as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem on the saturated e-graph. We provide both exact MILP solving and an efficient ASAP heuristic for scalable synthesis. Our evaluation on benchmarks from diverse applications targeting Xilinx Kintex UltraScale+ FPGAs demonstrates that SkyEgg achieves an average speedup of 3.01x over Vitis HLS, with improvements up to 5.22x for complex expressions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Edge-Centric Relational Reasoning for 3D Scene Graph Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15288v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene graph prediction aims to abstract complex 3D environments into structured graphs consisting of objects and their pairwise relationships. Existing approaches typically adopt object-centric graph neural networks, where relation edge features are iteratively updated by aggregating messages from connected object nodes. However, this design inherently restricts relation representations to pairwise object context, making it difficult to capture high-order relational dependencies that are essential for accurate relation prediction. To address this limitation, we propose a Link-guided Edge-centric relational reasoning framework with Object-aware fusion, namely LEO, which enables progressive reasoning from relation-level context to object-level understanding. Specifically, LEO first predicts potential links between object pairs to suppress irrelevant edges, and then transforms the original scene graph into a line graph where each relation is treated as a node. A line graph neural network is applied to perform edge-centric relational reasoning to capture inter-relation context. The enriched relation features are subsequently integrated into the original object-centric graph to enhance object-level reasoning and improve relation prediction. Our framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any existing object-centric method. Experiments on the 3DSSG dataset with two competitive baselines show consistent improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of our edge-to-object reasoning paradigm.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Graph Query Networks (GQN), an attention-based framework that models objects sensed by radar as graphs, to extract individualized relational and contextual features. GQN employs a novel concept of graph queries to dynamically attend over the bird's-eye view (BEV) space, constructing object-specific graphs processed by two novel modules: EdgeFocus for relational reasoning and DeepContext Pooling for contextual aggregation. On the NuScenes dataset, GQN improves relative mAP by up to +53%, including a +8.2% gain over the strongest prior radar method, while reducing peak graph construction overhead by 80% with moderate FLOPs cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in WACV 2026 Main Conference</p></details> |

For drug discovery specifically, a key inflection - akin to vision's "ImageNet moment" - arrived in 2015, when deep neural networks surpassed traditional approaches on the Tox21 Data Challenge. This milestone accelerated the adoption of deep learning across the pharmaceutical industry, and today most major companies have integrated these methods into their research pipelines. After the Tox21 Challenge concluded, its dataset was included in several established benchmarks, such as MoleculeNet and the Open Graph Benchmark. However, during these integrations, the dataset was altered and labels were imputed or manufactured, resulting in a loss of comparability across studies. Consequently, the extent to which bioactivity and toxicity prediction methods have improved over the past decade remains unclear. To this end, we introduce a reproducible leaderboard, hosted on Hugging Face with the original Tox21 Challenge dataset, together with a set of baseline and representative methods. The current version of the leaderboard indicates that the original Tox21 winner - the ensemble-based DeepTox method - and the descriptor-based self-normalizing neural networks introduced in 2017, continue to perform competitively and rank among the top methods for toxicity prediction, leaving it unclear whether substantial progress in toxicity prediction has been achieved over the past decade. As part of this work, we make all baselines and evaluated models publicly accessible for inference via standardized API calls to Hugging Face Spaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graphical Model-based Inference on Persistent Homology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11996v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Persistent homology is a cornerstone of topological data analysis, offering a multiscale summary of topology with robustness to nuisance transformations, such as rotations and small deformations. Persistent homology has seen broad use across domains such as computer vision and neuroscience. Most statistical treatments, however, use homology primarily as a feature extractor, relying on statistical distance-based tests or simple time-to-event models for inferential tasks. While these approaches can detect global differences, they rarely localize the source of those differences. We address this gap by taking a graphical model-based approach: we associate each vertex with a population latent position in a conic space and model each bar's key events (birth and death times) using an exponential distribution, whose rate is a transformation of the latent positions according to an event occurring on the graph. The low-dimensional bars have simple graph-event representations, such as the formation of a minimum spanning tree or the triangulation of a loop, and thus enjoy tractable likelihoods. Taking a Bayesian approach, we infer latent positions and enable model extensions such as hierarchical models that allow borrowing strength across groups. Applications to a neuroimaging study of Alzheimer's disease demonstrate that our method localizes sources of difference and provides interpretable, model-based analyses of topological structure in complex data. The code is provided and maintained at https://github.com/zitian-wu/graphPH.</p></details> | 29 pages, 11 figures |

We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\%/90\%/88\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dental3R: Geometry-Aware Pairing for Intraoral 3D Reconstruction from Sparse-View Photographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14315v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intraoral 3D reconstruction is fundamental to digital orthodontics, yet conventional methods like intraoral scanning are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which typically relies on sparse smartphone imagery. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Recently developed methods, such as those based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and Transformers, demonstrate exceptional performance across various datasets by effectively extracting structural information. However, the benchmarking of these novel methods often varies significantly in terms of hyperparameter settings and datasets, which limits algorithmic progress. In view of these, we conducted a comprehensive survey and benchmark for drug-target interaction modeling from a structural perspective via integrating tens of explicit (i.e., GNN-based) and implicit (i.e., Transformer-based) structure learning algorithms. We conducted a macroscopical comparison between these two classes of encoding strategies as well as the different featurization techniques that inform molecules' chemical and physical properties. We then carry out the microscopical comparison between all the integrated models across the six datasets via comprehensively benchmarking their effectiveness and efficiency. To ensure fairness, we investigate model performance under individually optimized configuration. Remarkably, the summarized insights from the benchmark studies lead to the design of model combos. We demonstrate that our combos can achieve new state-of-the-art performance on various datasets associated with cost-effective memory and computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[BrainHGT: A Hierarchical Graph Transformer for Interpretable Brain Network Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17604v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformer shows remarkable potential in brain network analysis due to its ability to model graph structures and complex node relationships. Most existing methods typically model the brain as a flat network, ignoring its modular structure, and their attention mechanisms treat all brain region connections equally, ignoring distance-related node connection patterns. However, brain information processing is a hierarchical process that involves local and long-range interactions between brain regions, interactions between regions and sub-functional modules, and interactions among functional modules themselves. This hierarchical interaction mechanism enables the brain to efficiently integrate local computations and global information flow, supporting the execution of complex cognitive functions. To address this issue, we propose BrainHGT, a hierarchical Graph Transformer that simulates the brain's natural information processing from local regions to global communities. Specifically, we design a novel long-short range attention encoder that utilizes parallel pathways to handle dense local interactions and sparse long-range connections, thereby effectively alleviating the over-globalizing issue. To further capture the brain's modular architecture, we designe a prior-guided clustering module that utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to group brain regions into functional communities and leverage neuroanatomical prior to guide the clustering process, thereby improving the biological plausibility and interpretability. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method significantly improves performance of disease identification, and can reliably capture the sub-functional modules of the brain, demonstrating its interpretability.</p></details> |  |

KGs are structured representations of factual knowledge consisting of entities and relations. Due to the high construction cost, they had been regarded as static databases with validated links. However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the "fill-in-the-blank" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our method correctly answers up to around 70% of the questions, while providing traceability of the procedure. We also highlight that the question category has a vast influence on the accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at NeLaMKRR@KR, 2025 (arXiv:2511.09575)</p></details> |

Existing methods often utilize extensive sets of unlabeled amino acid sequences. However, these approaches neither explicitly capture nor harness the accessible protein 3D structural data, which is recognized as a decisive factor in dictating protein functions. To address this, we utilize protein residue graphs and introduce various forms of sequential or structural connections to capture enhanced spatial information. We adeptly combine Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Language Models (LMs), specifically utilizing a pre-trained transformer-based protein language model to encode amino acid sequences and employing message-passing mechanisms like GCN and R-GCN to capture geometric characteristics of protein structures. Employing convolution within a specific node's nearby region, including relations, we stack multiple convolutional layers to efficiently learn combined insights from the protein's spatial graph, revealing intricate interconnections and dependencies in its structural arrangement. To assess our model's performance, we employed the training dataset provided by NetSurfP-2.0, which outlines secondary structure in 3-and 8-states. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model, SSRGNet surpasses the baseline on f1-scores.</p></details> | 40 pages |

However, identifying effective reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode, specifically in the context of cellular reprogramming. To solve it, we devise GATTACA, a scalable computational framework. To facilitate scalability of our framework, we consider previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and improve the procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. We then incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolution operations into the artificial neural network approximator of the DRL agent's action-value function. This allows us to leverage the available knowledge on the structure of a biological system and to indirectly, yet effectively, encode the system's modelled dynamics into a latent representation. Experiments on several large-scale, real-world biological networks from the literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Unlike vision and language tasks, where models can exploit inductive biases in the data, tabular data lacks inherent positional structure, hindering the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based models like TabTransformer, SAINT, and FT-Transformer (which we refer to as 3T) have shown promise on tabular data, they typically operate without leveraging structural cues such as positional encodings (PEs), as no prior structural information is usually available. In this work, we find both theoretically and empirically that structural cues, specifically PEs can be a useful tool to improve generalization performance for tabular transformers. We find that PEs impart the ability to reduce the effective rank (a form of intrinsic dimensionality) of the features, effectively simplifying the task by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, yielding improved generalization. To that end, we propose Tab-PET (PEs for Tabular Transformers), a graph-based framework for estimating and inculcating PEs into embeddings. Inspired by approaches that derive PEs from graph topology, we explore two paradigms for graph estimation: association-based and causality-based. We empirically demonstrate that graph-derived PEs significantly improve performance across 50 classification and regression datasets for 3T. Notably, association-based graphs consistently yield more stable and pronounced gains compared to causality-driven ones. Our work highlights an unexpected role of PEs in tabular transformers, revealing how they can be harnessed to improve generalization.</p></details> |  |

In $c$-Closed Vertex Deletion, the input is a graph $G$ and an integer $k$ and we ask whether $G$ can be transformed into a $c$-closed graph by deleting at most $k$ vertices. We study the classic and parameterized complexity of $c$-Closed Vertex Deletion. We obtain, for example, NP-hardness for the case that $G$ is bipartite with bounded maximum degree. We also show upper and lower bounds on the size of problem kernels for the parameter $k$ and introduce a new parameter, the number $x$ of vertices in bad pairs, for which we show a problem kernel of size $\mathcal{O}(x^3 + x^2\cdot c))$. Here, a pair of nonadjacent vertices is bad if they have at least $c$ common neighbors. Finally, we show that $c$-Closed Vertex Deletion can be solved in polynomial time on unit interval graphs with depth at most $c+1$ and that it is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the neighborhood diversity of $G$.</p></details> |  |

In the proposed system, a sender transmits textual information to a receiver, while a potential eavesdropper attempts to intercept the information. At the sender side, the text is initially preprocessed, where each sentence is annotated with its corresponding topic, and subsequently extracted into a knowledge graph. To achieve the secure transmission of the knowledge graph, we propose a channel encryption scheme that integrates constellation diagonal transformation with multi-parameter weighted fractional Fourier transform (MP-WFRFT). At the receiver side, the textual data is first decrypted, and then recovered via a transformer model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the probability of information compromise. The legitimate receiver achieves a Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score of 0.9, whereas the BLEU score of the eavesdropper remains below 0.3. Compared to the baselines, the proposed method can improve the security by up to 20%.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IEEE Journal of Communications and Networks (JCN)</p></details> |

While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

First, they typically rely on assumptions leading to decay properties of local agent interactions, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies such as cascading power failures or epidemic outbreaks. Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures. Further, to improve credit assignment during training, STACCA integrates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator that is compatible with state-value critic estimates. We evaluate STACCA on epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks, demonstrating improved performance, network generalization, and scalability. These results highlight the potential of transformer-based MARL architectures to achieve scalable and generalizable control in large-scale networked systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted for review</p></details> |

However, capturing the complex spatial and temporal dependencies of HIV transmission remains challenging. Conventional Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) models rely on a fixed binary adjacency matrix that only encodes geographic adjacency, which is unable to represent interactions between non-contiguous counties. Our study proposes a deep learning architecture Mobility-Aware Transformer-Message Passing Neural Network (MAT-MPNN) framework to predict county-level HIV diagnosis rates across California, Florida, and the New England region. The model combines temporal features extracted by a Transformer encoder with spatial relationships captured through a Mobility Graph Generator (MGG). The MGG improves conventional adjacency matrices by combining geographic and demographic information. Compared with the best-performing hybrid baseline, the Transformer MPNN model, MAT-MPNN reduced the Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE) by 27.9% in Florida, 39.1% in California, and 12.5% in New England, and improved the Predictive Model Choice Criterion (PMCC) by 7.7%, 3.5%, and 3.9%, respectively. MAT-MPNN also achieved better results than the Spatially Varying Auto-Regressive (SVAR) model in Florida and New England, with comparable performance in California. These results demonstrate that applying mobility-aware dynamic spatial structures substantially enhances predictive accuracy and calibration in spatiotemporal epidemiological prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 20 figures,1 table.

To achieve this, quantum programs are typically represented as quantum circuits, which must be optimized and adapted for target hardware through quantum circuit compilation. We introduce ZX-DB, a data-driven system that performs quantum circuit simplification and rewriting inside a graph database using ZX-calculus, a complete graphical formalism for quantum mechanics. ZX-DB encodes ZX-calculus rewrite rules as standard openCypher queries and executes them on an example graph database engine, Memgraph, enabling efficient, database-native transformations of large-scale quantum circuits. ZX-DB integrates correctness validation via tensor and graph equivalence checks and is evaluated against the state-of-the-art PyZX framework. Experimental results show that ZX-DB achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup for independent rewrites, while exposing pattern-matching bottlenecks in current graph database engines. By uniting quantum compilation and graph data management, ZX-DB opens a new systems direction toward scalable, database-supported quantum computing pipelines.</p></details> | 9 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Are Graph Transformers Necessary? Efficient Long-Range Message Passing with Fractal Nodes in MPNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13010v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, but often struggle to balance local and global information. While graph Transformers aim to address this by enabling long-range interactions, they often overlook the inherent locality and efficiency of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). We propose a new concept called fractal nodes, inspired by the fractal structure observed in real-world networks. Our approach is based on the intuition that graph partitioning naturally induces fractal structure, where subgraphs often reflect the connectivity patterns of the full graph. Fractal nodes are designed to coexist with the original nodes and adaptively aggregate subgraph-level feature representations, thereby enforcing feature similarity within each subgraph. We show that fractal nodes alleviate the over-squashing problem by providing direct shortcut connections that enable long-range propagation of subgraph-level representations. Experiment results show that our method improves the expressive power of MPNNs and achieves comparable or better performance to graph Transformers while maintaining the computational efficiency of MPNN by improving the long-range dependencies of MPNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026 for Oral Representation.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph, introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we propose a $\textbf{Logic}$-aware $\textbf{R}etrieval$-$\textbf{A}$ugmented $\textbf{G}$eneration framework ($\textbf{LogicRAG}$) that dynamically extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to AAAI'26</p></details> |

However, their computational complexity and irregular memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply. In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency, up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage compared to state-of-the-art GNN designs while also delivering higher model accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. This is the first interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable, and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader adoption across scientific applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>It ha...</summary><p>It has been accepted by FPT 2025</p></details> |

Scale Graph Metanetworks (ScaleGMNs) explicitly leverage these symmetries by proposing an architecture equivariant to both permutation and parameter scaling transformations. Previous work by Ainsworth et al. (2023) addressed permutation symmetries through a computationally intensive combinatorial assignment problem, demonstrating that leveraging permutation symmetries alone can map networks into a shared loss basin. In this work, we extend their approach by also incorporating scaling symmetries, presenting an autoencoder framework utilizing ScaleGMNs as invariant encoders. Experimental results demonstrate that our method aligns Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) under both permutation and scaling symmetries without explicitly solving the assignment problem. This approach ensures that similar networks naturally converge within the same basin, facilitating model merging, i.e., smooth linear interpolation while avoiding regions of high loss.

| **[Hierarchical Frequency-Decomposition Graph Neural Networks for Road Network Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12507v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road networks are critical infrastructures underpinning intelligent transportation systems and their related applications. Effective representation learning of road networks remains challenging due to the complex interplay between spatial structures and frequency characteristics in traffic patterns. Existing graph neural networks for modeling road networks predominantly fall into two paradigms: spatial-based methods that capture local topology but tend to over-smooth representations, and spectral-based methods that analyze global frequency components but often overlook localized variations. This spatial-spectral misalignment limits their modeling capacity for road networks exhibiting both coarse global trends and fine-grained local fluctuations. To bridge this gap, we propose HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical frequency-decomposition graph neural network that unifies spatial and spectral modeling. HiFiNet constructs a multi-level hierarchy of virtual nodes to enable localized frequency analysis, and employs a decomposition-updating-reconstruction framework with a topology-aware graph transformer to separately model and fuse low- and high-frequency signals. Theoretically justified and empirically validated on multiple real-world datasets across four downstream tasks, HiFiNet demonstrates superior performance and generalization ability in capturing effective road network representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Aware Retrieval Augmentation for Dynamic Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12495v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic recommendation systems aim to provide personalized suggestions by modeling temporal user-item interactions across time-series behavioral data. Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained dynamic graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn user-item representations over temporal snapshot graphs. However, fine-tuning GNNs on these graphs often results in generalization issues due to temporal discrepancies between pre-training and fine-tuning stages, limiting the model's ability to capture evolving user preferences. To address this, we propose TarDGR, a task-aware retrieval-augmented framework designed to enhance generalization capability by incorporating task-aware model and retrieval-augmentation. Specifically, TarDGR introduces a Task-Aware Evaluation Mechanism to identify semantically relevant historical subgraphs, enabling the construction of task-specific datasets without manual labeling. It also presents a Graph Transformer-based Task-Aware Model that integrates semantic and structural encodings to assess subgraph relevance. During inference, TarDGR retrieves and fuses task-aware subgraphs with the query subgraph, enriching its representation and mitigating temporal generalization issues. Experiments on multiple large-scale dynamic graph datasets demonstrate that TarDGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with extensive empirical evidence underscoring its superior accuracy and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

Current Transformer- or Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based multimodal depression detection methods face significant challenges in modeling individual differences and cross-modal temporal dependencies across diverse behavioral contexts. Therefore, we propose P$^3$HF (Personality-guided Public-Private Domain Disentangled Hypergraph-Former Network) with three key innovations: (1) personality-guided representation learning using LLMs to transform discrete individual features into contextual descriptions for personalized encoding; (2) Hypergraph-Former architecture modeling high-order cross-modal temporal relationships; (3) event-level domain disentanglement with contrastive learning for improved generalization across behavioral contexts. Experiments on MPDD-Young dataset show P$^3$HF achieves around 10\% improvement on accuracy and weighted F1 for binary and ternary depression classification task over existing methods. Extensive ablation studies validate the independent contribution of each architectural component, confirming that personality-guided representation learning and high-order hypergraph reasoning are both essential for generating robust, individual-aware depression-related representations.

While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong performance by capturing long-range temporal dependencies, their reliance on self-attention results in quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, limiting scalability on high-frequency or large-scale graphs. In this work, we revisit the necessity of self-attention in dynamic graph modeling. Inspired by recent findings that attribute the success of Transformers more to their architectural design than attention itself, we propose GLFormer, a novel attention-free Transformer-style framework for dynamic graphs. GLFormer introduces an adaptive token mixer that performs context-aware local aggregation based on interaction order and time intervals. To capture long-term dependencies, we further design a hierarchical aggregation module that expands the temporal receptive field by stacking local token mixers across layers. Experiments on six widely-used dynamic graph benchmarks show that GLFormer achieves SOTA performance, which reveals that attention-free architectures can match or surpass Transformer baselines in dynamic graph settings with significantly improved efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP), a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.

In comparison to the state of the art literature, our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with lower computational cost (without ensemble). While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

We introduce the perception gap index, a graph-based measure that quantifies local-global opinion divergence, which can be viewed as a generalization of the majority illusion to continuous settings. Using techniques from spectral graph theory, we demonstrate that higher connectivity makes networks more resilient to perception distortion. Our analysis of stochastic block models, however, shows that pronounced community structure increases vulnerability. We also study the problem of minimizing the perception gap via link recommendation with a fixed budget. We prove that this problem does not admit a polynomial-time algorithm for any bounded approximation ratio, unless P = NP. However, we propose a collection of efficient heuristic methods that have been demonstrated to produce near-optimal solutions on real-world network data.</p></details> |  |

However, the nonlinear nature of specklegram data presents significant challenges for accurate temperature prediction. This study investigates the use of transformer-based architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Swin Transformers, and emerging models such as Learnable Importance Non-Symmetric Attention Vision Transformers (LINA-ViT) and Multi-Adaptive Proximity Vision Graph Attention Transformers (MAP-ViGAT), to predict temperature from specklegram data over a range of 0 to 120 Celsius. The results show that ViTs achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.15, outperforming traditional models such as CNNs. GAT-ViT and MAP-ViGAT variants also demonstrated competitive accuracy, highlighting the importance of adaptive attention mechanisms and graph-based structures in capturing complex modal interactions and phase shifts in specklegram data. Additionally, this study incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including attention maps and saliency maps, to provide insights into the decision-making processes of the transformer models, improving interpretability and transparency. These findings establish transformer architectures as strong benchmarks for optical fiber-based temperature sensing and offer promising directions for industrial monitoring and structural health assessment applications.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, judicious planning and utilization of quantum computer runtime are essential to ensure smooth execution and completion of projects. Accurate estimation of a quantum circuit's execution time is thus necessary to prevent unexpectedly exceeding the anticipated runtime or the maximum capacity of the quantum computers; it also allows quantum computing platforms to make precisely informed provisioning and prioritization of quantum computing jobs. In this paper, we first study the characteristics of quantum circuits' runtime on simulators and real quantum computers. Then, we introduce an innovative method that employs a graph transformer-based model, utilizing the graph information and global information of quantum circuits to estimate their execution time. We selected a benchmark dataset comprising over 1,510 quantum circuits, initially predicting their execution times on simulators, which yielded promising results with an R-squared value greater than 95%. Subsequently, we applied active learning to select 340 circuit samples with a confidence level of 95% to build and evaluate our approach for the estimation of circuit execution times on quantum computers, achieving an average R-squared value exceeding 90%. Our approach can be integrated into quantum computing platforms to provide an accurate estimation of quantum execution time and be used as a reference for prioritizing quantum execution jobs. In addition, our findings provide insights for quantum program developers to optimize their circuits for reduced execution time.</p></details> |  |

Recent generative object detectors address this limitation by coupling an autoregressive language model with a detector backbone, enabling direct category name generation for each detected object. However, this straightforward design introduces structural redundancy and substantial latency. In this paper, we propose a Real-Time Generative Detection Transformer (RTGen), a real-time generative object detector with a succinct encoder-decoder architecture. Specifically, we introduce a novel Region-Language Decoder (RL-Decoder) that jointly decodes visual and textual representations within a unified framework. The textual side is organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), enabling non-autoregressive category naming. Benefiting from these designs, RTGen-R34 achieves 131.3 FPS on T4 GPUs, over 270x faster than GenerateU. Moreover, our models learn to generate category names directly from detection labels, without relying on external supervision such as CLIP or pretrained language models, achieving efficient and flexible open-ended detection.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge lies in capturing dynamic interdependencies that evolve with distinct part geometries as operations are performed. Machine learning has been applied to address challenges in MP, such as operation selection and machining sequence prediction. Dynamic graph learning (DGL) has been widely used to model dynamic systems, thanks to its ability to integrate spatio-temporal relationships. However, in MP, while existing DGL approaches can capture these dependencies, they fail to incorporate three-dimensional (3D) geometric information of parts and thus lack domain awareness in predicting machining operation sequences. To address this limitation, we propose MP-GFormer, a 3D-geometry-aware dynamic graph transformer that integrates evolving 3D geometric representations into DGL through an attention mechanism to predict machining operation sequences. Our approach leverages StereoLithography surface meshes representing the 3D geometry of a part after each machining operation, with the boundary representation method used for the initial 3D designs. We evaluate MP-GFormer on a synthesized dataset and demonstrate that the method achieves improvements of 24\% and 36\% in accuracy for main and sub-operation predictions, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, most computational models treat genes as isolated numerical features, ignoring the rich biological semantics encoded in their symbols. This prevents a truly deep understanding of critical biological characteristics. To overcome this limitation, we present SemST, a semantic-guided deep learning framework for spatial transcriptomics data clustering. SemST leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable genes to "speak" through their symbolic meanings, transforming gene sets within each tissue spot into biologically informed embeddings. These embeddings are then fused with the spatial neighborhood relationships captured by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), achieving a coherent integration of biological function and spatial structure. We further introduce the Fine-grained Semantic Modulation (FSM) module to optimally exploit these biological priors. The FSM module learns spot-specific affine transformations that empower the semantic embeddings to perform an element-wise calibration of the spatial features, thus dynamically injecting high-order biological knowledge into the spatial context.

| **[Explicit Multimodal Graph Modeling for Human-Object Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12554v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection, which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork \textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level visual and language features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs. Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Attributed Graph Learning via Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11245v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attributed graphs, typically characterized by irregular topologies and a mix of numerical and categorical attributes, are ubiquitous in diverse domains such as social networks, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics. While graph kernels provide a principled framework for measuring graph similarity, existing kernel methods often struggle to simultaneously capture heterogeneous attribute semantics and neighborhood information in attributed graphs. In this work, we propose the Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernel (NASK), a novel graph kernel designed for attributed graph learning. NASK leverages an exponential transformation of the Gower similarity coefficient to jointly model numerical and categorical features efficiently, and employs star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to integrate multi-scale neighborhood structural information. We theoretically prove that NASK is positive definite, ensuring compatibility with kernel-based learning frameworks such as SVMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven attributed and four large-scale real-world graph benchmarks. The results demonstrate that NASK consistently achieves superior performance over sixteen state-of-the-art baselines, including nine graph kernels and seven Graph Neural Networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[NTSFormer: A Self-Teaching Graph Transformer for Multimodal Isolated Cold-Start Node Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04870v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Isolated cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because such nodes have no edges and often have missing modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for isolated cold-start inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However, this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student" prediction based only on self information (i.e., the node's own features), and a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature data into token sequences, which are then processed by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion. Experiments on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior performance for multimodal isolated cold-start node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Hypergraph Neural Network with State Space Models for Node Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06587v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention for node classification tasks on graph-structured data. However, traditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes, often overlooking the role-based characteristics that can provide complementary insights for learning expressive node representations. Existing frameworks for extracting role-based features are largely unsupervised and often fail to translate effectively into downstream predictive tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a hypergraph neural network with a state space model (HGMN). The model integrates role-aware representations into GNNs by combining hypergraph construction with state-space modeling in a principled manner. HGMN employs hypergraph construction techniques to capture higher-order relationships and leverages a learnable mamba transformer mechanism to fuse role-based and adjacency-based embeddings. By exploring two distinct hypergraph construction strategies, degree-based and neighborhood-based, the framework reinforces connectivity among nodes with structural similarity, thereby enriching the learned representations. Furthermore, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution layers enables the model to account for complex dependencies within hypergraph structures. To alleviate the over-smoothing problem encountered in deeper networks, we incorporate residual connections, which improve stability and promote effective feature propagation across layers. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets including OGB, ACM, DBLP, IIP TerroristRel, Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed demonstrate that HGMN consistently outperforms strong baselines in node classification tasks. These results support the claim that explicitly incorporating role-based features within a hypergraph framework offers tangible benefits for node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies have introduced PEFTs tailored for point cloud data, as general approaches are suboptimal. To further reduce the number of trainable parameters, we propose a point-cloud-specific PEFT, termed Graph Features Tuning (GFT), which learns a dynamic graph from initial tokenized inputs of the transformer using a lightweight graph convolution network and passes these graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules. Extensive experiments on object classification and segmentation tasks show that GFT operates in the same domain, rivalling existing methods, while reducing the trainable parameters.

This paper presents a systematic evaluation of navigation strategies for this task, comparing agents guided by graph-theoretic structure (betweenness centrality), semantic meaning (language model embeddings), and hybrid approaches. Through rigorous benchmarking on a large Wikipedia subgraph, we demonstrate that a purely greedy agent guided by the semantic similarity of article titles is overwhelmingly effective. This strategy, when combined with a simple loop-avoidance mechanism, achieved a perfect success rate and navigated the network with an efficiency an order of magnitude better than structural or hybrid methods. Our findings highlight the critical limitations of purely structural heuristics for goal-directed search and underscore the transformative potential of large language models to act as powerful, zero-shot semantic navigators in complex information spaces.</p></details> |  |

These properties make origami increasingly valuable in robotic and deployable systems. However, accurately simulating their folding behavior and interactions with the environment remains challenging. To address this, we present a design framework for origami mechanism simulation that utilizes MuJoCo's deformable-body capabilities. In our approach, origami sheets are represented as graphs of interconnected deformable elements with user-specified constraints such as creases and actuation, defined through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). This framework allows users to generate physically consistent simulations that capture both the geometric structure of origami mechanisms and their interactions with external objects and surfaces. We demonstrate our method's utility through a case study on an origami catapult, where design parameters are optimized in simulation using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and validated experimentally on physical prototypes. The optimized structure achieves improved throwing performance, illustrating how our system enables rapid, simulation-driven origami design, optimization, and analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages, 9 Figures, Submitted to IEEE RoboSoft</p></details> |
| **[A Novel Sliced Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02364v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance and its fused extension (FGW) are powerful tools for comparing heterogeneous data. Their computation is, however, challenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal transport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been proposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version is restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries, strongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an appropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the underlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the numerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and allowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance actually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from below and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW. Since we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is numerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance; especially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.</p></details> |  |

Yet remains an unsolved challenge across domains like healthcare or vehicle diagnostics. We introduce CARGO, a scalable multi-label causal discovery method for sparse, high-dimensional event sequences comprising of thousands of unique event types. Using two pretrained causal Transformers as domain-specific foundation models for event sequences. CARGO infers in parallel, per sequence one-shot causal graphs and aggregates them using an adaptive frequency fusion to reconstruct the global Markov boundaries of labels. This two-stage approach enables efficient probabilistic reasoning at scale while bypassing the intractable cost of full-dataset conditional independence testing. Our results on a challenging real-world automotive fault prediction dataset with over 29,100 unique event types and 474 imbalanced labels demonstrate CARGO's ability to perform structured reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeuRIPS2025 Workshop on Structured Probabilistic Inference and Generative Modeling</p></details> |

While recent methods have become increasingly complex, the field lacks a strong and informative baseline to reliably gauge progress. This paper proposes HyperEvent, a simple approach that captures relative structural patterns in event sequences through an intuitive encoding mechanism. As a straightforward baseline, HyperEvent leverages relative structural encoding to identify meaningful event sequences without complex parameterization. By combining these interpretable features with a lightweight transformer classifier, HyperEvent reframes link prediction as event structure recognition. Despite its simplicity, HyperEvent achieves competitive results across multiple benchmarks, often matching the performance of more complex models. This work demonstrates that effective modeling can be achieved through simple structural encoding, providing a clear reference point for evaluating future advancements.</p></details> |  |

Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, as a useful application of LLMs, can improve contextual reasoning through structured entity and relationship identification from long-context knowledge, e.g. biomedical literature. Even though many advantages over naive RAGs, most of graph-based RAGs are computationally intensive, which limits their application to large-scale dataset. To address this issue, we introduce fastbmRAG, an fast graph-based RAG optimized for biomedical literature. Utilizing well organized structure of biomedical papers, fastbmRAG divides the construction of knowledge graph into two stages, first drafting graphs using abstracts; and second, refining them using main texts guided by vector-based entity linking, which minimizes redundancy and computational load. Our evaluations demonstrate that fastbmRAG is over 10x faster than existing graph-RAG tools and achieve superior coverage and accuracy to input knowledge. FastbmRAG provides a fast solution for quickly understanding, summarizing, and answering questions about biomedical literature on a large scale.

However, predicting the diffusion trajectory and market impact of such content remains challenging due to data heterogeneity, non linear propagation mechanisms, and evolving consumer interactions. This study proposes an AI driven Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates multi source data including social media streams, marketing expenditure records, consumer engagement logs, and sentiment dynamics using a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Temporal Transformer framework. The model jointly learns the content diffusion structure and temporal influence evolution through a dual channel architecture, while causal inference modules disentangle the effects of marketing stimuli on return on investment (ROI) and market visibility. Experiments on large scale real-world datasets collected from multiple online platforms such as Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube advertising show that our system outperforms existing baselines in all six metrics. The proposed DSS enhances marketing decisions by providing interpretable real-time insights into AIGC driven content dissemination and market growth patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solvaformer: an SE(3)-equivariant graph transformer for small molecule solubility prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09774v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of small molecule solubility using material-sparing approaches is critical for accelerating synthesis and process optimization, yet experimental measurement is costly and many learning approaches either depend on quantumderived descriptors or offer limited interpretability. We introduce Solvaformer, a geometry-aware graph transformer that models solutions as multiple molecules with independent SE(3) symmetries. The architecture combines intramolecular SE(3)-equivariant attention with intermolecular scalar attention, enabling cross-molecular communication without imposing spurious relative geometry. We train Solvaformer in a multi-task setting to predict both solubility (log S) and solvation free energy, using an alternating-batch regimen that trains on quantum-mechanical data (CombiSolv-QM) and on experimental measurements (BigSolDB 2.0). Solvaformer attains the strongest overall performance among the learned models and approaches a DFT-assisted gradient-boosting baseline, while outperforming an EquiformerV2 ablation and sequence-based alternatives. In addition, token-level attention produces chemically coherent attributions: case studies recover known intra- vs. inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding patterns that govern solubility differences in positional isomers. Taken together, Solvaformer provides an accurate, scalable, and interpretable approach to solution-phase property prediction by uniting geometric inductive bias with a mixed dataset training strategy on complementary computational and experimental data.</p></details> |  |

We propose NeuroLingua, a language-inspired framework that conceptualizes sleep as a structured physiological language. Each 30-second epoch is decomposed into overlapping 3-second subwindows ("tokens") using a CNN-based tokenizer, enabling hierarchical temporal modeling through dual-level Transformers: intra-segment encoding of local dependencies and inter-segment integration across seven consecutive epochs (3.5 minutes) for extended context. Modality-specific embeddings from EEG and EOG channels are fused via a Graph Convolutional Network, facilitating robust multimodal integration. NeuroLingua is evaluated on the Sleep-EDF Expanded and ISRUC-Sleep datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on Sleep-EDF (85.3% accuracy, 0.800 macro F1, and 0.796 Cohen's kappa) and competitive performance on ISRUC (81.9% accuracy, 0.802 macro F1, and 0.755 kappa), matching or exceeding published baselines in overall and per-class metrics. The architecture's attention mechanisms enhance the detection of clinically relevant sleep microevents, providing a principled foundation for future interpretability, explainability, and causal inference in sleep research. By framing sleep as a compositional language, NeuroLingua unifies hierarchical sequence modeling and multimodal fusion, advancing automated sleep staging toward more transparent and clinically meaningful applications.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose GNNMoE, a novel entropy-driven mixture of message-passing experts framework that enables node-level adaptive representation learning. GNNMoE decomposes message passing into propagation and transformation operations and integrates them through multiple expert networks guided by a hybrid routing mechanism. And a routing entropy regularization dynamically adjusts soft weighting and soft top-$k$ routing, allowing GNNMoE to flexibly adapt to diverse neighborhood contexts. Extensive experiments on twelve benchmark datasets demonstrate that GNNMoE consistently outperforms SOTA node classification methods, while maintaining scalability and interpretability. This work provides a unified and principled approach for achieving fine-grained, personalized node representation learning.</p></details> |  |

The claim has been proven for different classes of models such as mesh refinements from computer graphics, Lindenmayer systems from morphogenesis modeling and cellular automata from biological, physical and parallel computation modeling. The Global Transformation formalism achieves this by using category theory for its genericity, and more precisely the notion of Kan extension to determine the global behaviors based on the local ones. On the other side, Causal Graph Dynamics describe the transformation of port graphs in a synchronous and deterministic way and has not yet being tackled. In this paper, we show the precise sense in which the claim of Global Transformations holds for them as well. This is done by showing different ways in which they can be expressed as Kan extensions, each of them highlighting different features of Causal Graph Dynamics. Along the way, this work uncovers the interesting class of Monotonic Causal Graph Dynamics and their universality among General Causal Graph Dynamics.</p></details> |  |

The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Covariance Scattering Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08878v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.</p></details> |  |

Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the visual model robustness against gradient-based white box adversarial attacks, while incurring only a marginal drop in clean accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV2025 Workshop, short paper</p></details> |

However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Public benchmarks remain significantly smaller and hand-crafted, while releasing truly malicious RTL raises ethical and operational risks. This work presents an automated and scalable methodology for generating HT-like patterns in industry-scale netlists whose purpose is to stress-test detection tools without altering user-visible functionality. The pipeline (i) parses large gate-level designs into connectivity graphs, (ii) explores rare regions using SCOAP testability metrics, and (iii) applies parameterized, function-preserving graph transformations to synthesize trigger-payload pairs that mimic the statistical footprint of stealthy HTs. When evaluated on the benchmarks generated in this work, representative state-of-the-art graph-learning models fail to detect Trojans. The framework closes the evaluation gap between academic circuits and modern SoCs by providing reproducible challenge instances that advance security research without sharing step-by-step attack instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in DATE 2026</p></details> |

Existing approaches struggle to transfer knowledge effectively. We propose 'One Model for All', a universal pre-training framework for EEG analysis across disparate datasets. Our paradigm decouples learning into two stages: (1) Univariate pre-training via self-supervised contrastive learning on individual channels, enabled by a Unified Channel Schema (UCS) that leverages the channel union (e.g., SEED-62ch, DEAP-32ch); (2) Multivariate fine-tuning with a novel 'ART' (Adaptive Resampling Transformer) and 'GAT' (Graph Attention Network) architecture to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Experiments show universal pre-training is an essential stabilizer, preventing collapse on SEED (vs. scratch) and yielding substantial gains on DEAP (+7.65%) and DREAMER (+3.55%). Our framework achieves new SOTA performance on all within-subject benchmarks: SEED (99.27%), DEAP (93.69%), and DREAMER (93.93%). We also show SOTA cross-dataset transfer, achieving 94.08% (intersection) and 93.05% (UCS) on the unseen DREAMER dataset, with the former surpassing the within-domain pre-training benchmark. Ablation studies validate our architecture: the GAT module is critical, yielding a +22.19% gain over GCN on the high-noise DEAP dataset, and its removal causes a catastrophic -16.44% performance drop. This work paves the way for more universal, scalable, and effective pre-trained models for diverse EEG analysis tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, applying DiTs to molecules introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative modeling of molecular structures.

However, its scalability on large-scale graphs is hindered by the intensive message passing mechanism of GNN and the quadratic computational complexity of contrastive loss over positive and negative node pairs. To address these issues, we propose an efficient GCL framework that transforms the input graph into a compact network of interconnected node sets while preserving structural information across communities. We firstly introduce a kernelized graph community contrastive loss with linear complexity, enabling effective information transfer among node sets to capture hierarchical structural information of the graph. We then incorporate a knowledge distillation technique into the decoupled GNN architecture to accelerate inference while maintaining strong generalization performance. Extensive experiments on sixteen real-world datasets of varying scales demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines in both effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> |  |

Existing expressivity results are often tied to specific design choices and lack comprehensive empirical validation on large-scale data. This leaves a gap between theory and practice, preventing generalizable insights that exceed particular application domains. Here, we propose the Generalized-Distance Transformer (GDT), a GT architecture using standard attention that incorporates many advancements for GTs from recent years, and develop a fine-grained understanding of the GDT's representation power in terms of attention and PEs. Through extensive experiments, we identify design choices that consistently perform well across various applications, tasks, and model scales, demonstrating strong performance in a few-shot transfer setting without fine-tuning. Our evaluation covers over eight million graphs with roughly 270M tokens across diverse domains, including image-based object detection, molecular property prediction, code summarization, and out-of-distribution algorithmic reasoning. We distill our theoretical and practical findings into several generalizable insights about effective GT design, training, and inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 as spotlight</p></details> |

However, existing evaluation resources heavily rely on small clinical interview corpora, social media posts, or synthetic dialogues, which limits their clinical validity and fails to capture the full complexity of diagnostic reasoning. In this work, we introduce PsychiatryBench, a rigorously curated benchmark grounded exclusively in authoritative, expert-validated psychiatric textbooks and casebooks. PsychiatryBench comprises eleven distinct question-answering tasks ranging from diagnostic reasoning and treatment planning to longitudinal follow-up, management planning, clinical approach, sequential case analysis, and multiple-choice/extended matching formats totaling 5,188 expert-annotated items. {\color{red}We evaluate a diverse set of frontier LLMs (including Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Sonnet 4.5, and GPT 5) alongside leading open-source medical models such as MedGemma using both conventional metrics and an "LLM-as-judge" similarity scoring framework. Our results reveal substantial gaps in clinical consistency and safety, particularly in multi-turn follow-up and management tasks, underscoring the need for specialized model tuning and more robust evaluation paradigms. PsychiatryBench offers a modular, extensible platform for benchmarking and improving LLM performance in mental health applications.</p></details> |  |

While these systems democratize software creation through natural language requirements, they introduce significant security risks that remain largely unexplored. We identify two risky scenarios: Malicious User with Benign Agents (MU-BA) and Benign User with Malicious Agents (BU-MA). We introduce the Implicit Malicious Behavior Injection Attack (IMBIA), demonstrating how multi-agent systems can be manipulated to generate software with concealed malicious capabilities beneath seemingly benign applications, and propose Adv-IMBIA as a defense mechanism. Evaluations across ChatDev, MetaGPT, and AgentVerse frameworks reveal varying vulnerability patterns, with IMBIA achieving attack success rates of 93%, 45%, and 71% in MU-BA scenarios, and 71%, 84%, and 45% in BU-MA scenarios. Our defense mechanism reduced attack success rates significantly, particularly in the MU-BA scenario. Further analysis reveals that compromised agents in the coding and testing phases pose significantly greater security risks, while also identifying critical agents that require protection against malicious user exploitation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust security measures in multi-agent software development systems and provide practical guidelines for implementing targeted, resource-efficient defensive strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 Alignment Track</p></details> |

While existing methods address these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other. Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as NIPS 2025 poster</p></details> |

The rollout phase, which dominates end-to-end iteration time, suffers from substantial long-tail latency and poor resource utilization due to inherent workload imbalance. We present Seer, a novel online context learning system that addresses these challenges by exploiting previously overlooked similarities in output lengths and generation patterns among requests sharing the same prompt. Seer introduces three key techniques: divided rollout for dynamic load balancing, context-aware scheduling, and adaptive grouped speculative decoding. Together, these mechanisms substantially reduce long-tail latency and improve resource efficiency during rollout. Evaluations on production-grade RL workloads demonstrate that Seer improves end-to-end rollout throughput by 74% to 97% and reduces long-tail latency by 75% to 93% compared to state-of-the-art synchronous RL systems, significantly accelerating RL training iterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, prompt injection attacks-malicious manipulations of input prompts-pose new threats that may undermine operational security, disrupt decision-making, and erode trust among allies. This perspective paper highlights four vulnerabilities in federated military LLMs: secret data leakage, free-rider exploitation, system disruption, and misinformation spread. To address these risks, we propose a human-AI collaborative framework with both technical and policy countermeasures. On the technical side, our framework uses red/blue team wargaming and quality assurance to detect and mitigate adversarial behaviors of shared LLM weights. On the policy side, it promotes joint AI-human policy development and verification of security protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 3rd International Workshop on Dataspaces and Digital Twins for Critical Entities and Smart Urban Communities - IEEE BigData 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLMs as Firmware Experts: A Runtime-Grown Tree-of-Agents Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18438v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agent systems have recently demonstrated strong potential in automating code reasoning and vulnerability detection. However, when applied to large-scale firmware, their performance degrades due to the binary nature of firmware, complex dependency structures, and heterogeneous components. To address this challenge, this paper presents FIRMHIVE, a recursive agent hive that enables LLMs to act as autonomous firmware security analysts. FIRMHIVE introduces two key mechanisms: (1) transforming delegation into a per-agent, executable primitive and (2) constructing a runtime Tree of Agents (ToA) for decentralized coordination. We evaluate FIRMHIVE using real-world firmware images obtained from publicly available datasets, covering five representative security analysis tasks. Compared with existing LLM-agent baselines, FIRMHIVE performs deeper (about 16x more reasoning steps) and broader (about 2.3x more files inspected) cross-file exploration, resulting in about 5.6x more alerts per firmware. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) security tools, FIRMHIVE identifies about 1.5x more vulnerabilities (1,802 total) and achieves 71% precision, representing significant improvements in both yield and fidelity.</p></details> | 18 pages, 13 figures |
| **[UnWEIRDing LLM Entity Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18403v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have been widely been adopted by users for writing tasks such as sentence completions. While this can improve writing efficiency, prior research shows that LLM-generated suggestions may exhibit cultural biases which may be difficult for users to detect, especially in educational contexts for non-native English speakers. While such prior work has studied the biases in LLM moral value alignment, we aim to investigate cultural biases in LLM recommendations for real-world entities. To do so, we use the WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) framework to evaluate recommendations by various LLMs across a dataset of fine-grained entities, and apply pluralistic prompt-based strategies to mitigate these biases. Our results indicate that while such prompting strategies do reduce such biases, this reduction is not consistent across different models, and recommendations for some types of entities are more biased than others.</p></details> |  |

Yet, their predictive ability varies sharply with domain structure and prompt framing. We investigate how forecasting performance varies with different model families on real-world questions about events that happened beyond the model cutoff date. We analyze how context, question type, and external knowledge affect accuracy and calibration, and how adding factual news context modifies belief formation and failure modes. Our results show that forecasting ability is highly variable as it depends on what, and how, we ask.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Needle in a Haystack: Intent-driven Reusable Artifacts Recommendation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18343v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In open source software development, the reuse of existing artifacts has been widely adopted to avoid redundant implementation work. Reusable artifacts are considered more efficient and reliable than developing software components from scratch. However, when faced with a large number of reusable artifacts, developers often struggle to find artifacts that can meet their expected needs. To reduce this burden, retrieval-based and learning-based techniques have been proposed to automate artifact recommendations. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the potential to understand intentions, perform semantic alignment, and recommend usable artifacts. Nevertheless, their effectiveness has not been thoroughly explored. To fill this gap, we construct an intent-driven artifact recommendation benchmark named IntentRecBench, covering three representative open source ecosystems. Using IntentRecBench, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study of five popular LLMs and six traditional approaches in terms of precision and efficiency. Our results show that although LLMs outperform traditional methods, they still suffer from low precision and high inference cost due to the large candidate space. Inspired by the ontology-based semantic organization in software engineering, we propose TreeRec, a feature tree-guided recommendation framework to mitigate these issues. TreeRec leverages LLM-based semantic abstraction to organize artifacts into a hierarchical semantic tree, enabling intent and function alignment and reducing reasoning time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TreeRec consistently improves the performance of diverse LLMs across ecosystems, highlighting its generalizability and potential for practical deployment.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[AP2O-Coder: Human-Inspired Progressive Optimization to Fix LLM Code Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02393v3)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs' code generation capabilities have yielded substantial improvements in the effectiveness of programming tasks. However, LLM-generated code still suffers from compilation and runtime errors. Existing offline preference optimization methods primarily focus on enhancing LLMs' coding abilities using pass/fail signals in the preference data, overlooking the deep-level error types in the failed codes. To address this, we propose Adaptively Progressive Preference Optimization (AP2O) for coding (i.e., AP2O-Coder), a method that guides LLMs adaptively and methodically to reduce code errors for code generation. Specifically, we construct an error notebook from failed codes and progressively optimize the LLM to correct errors type by type. Furthermore, we adaptively replay error types to tailor to the LLM's changing weaknesses throughout the training process. Through extensive experiments on both code and general LLMs (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek series) with parameters ranging from 0.5B to 34B, our AP2O-Coder improves code generation performance by up to 3% in pass@k while using less preference data.

Existing work focuses on isolated activities such as code generation or testing, leaving open questions about how LLMs affect developers, processes, products, and the software ecosystem. We address this gap through semi-structured interviews with sixteen early-adopter software professionals who integrated LLM-based tools into their day-to-day work in early to mid-2023. We treat these interviews as early empirical evidence and compare participants' accounts with recent work on LLMs in software engineering, noting which early patterns persist or shift. Using thematic analysis, we organize findings around four dimensions: people, process, product, and society. Developers reported substantial productivity gains from reducing routine tasks, streamlining search, and accelerating debugging, but also described a productivity-quality paradox: they often discarded generated code and shifted effort from writing to critically evaluating and integrating it. LLM use was highly phase-dependent, with strong uptake in implementation and debugging but limited influence on requirements gathering and other collaborative work. Participants developed new competencies to use LLMs effectively, including prompt engineering strategies, layered verification, and secure integration to protect proprietary data. They anticipated changes in hiring expectations, team practices, and computing education, while emphasizing that human judgment and foundational software engineering skills remain essential. Our findings, later echoed in large-scale quantitative studies, offer actionable implications for developers, organizations, educators, and tool designers seeking to integrate LLMs responsibly into software practice today.</p></details> |  |
| **[Path-Constrained Retrieval: A Structural Approach to Reliable LLM Agent Reasoning Through Graph-Scoped Semantic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18313v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model agents often retrieve context from knowledge bases that lack structural consistency with the agent's current reasoning state, leading to incoherent reasoning chains. We introduce Path-Constrained Retrieval (PCR), a retrieval method that combines structural graph constraints with semantic search to ensure retrieved information maintains logical relationships within a knowledge graph. PCR restricts the search space to nodes reachable from an anchor node, preventing retrieval of structurally disconnected information that may lead to inconsistent reasoning. We evaluate PCR on PathRAG-6, a benchmark spanning six domains with 180 nodes and 360 edges. Our results show that PCR achieves full structural consistency compared to 24-32 percent in baseline methods, while maintaining strong relevance scores. On the technology domain, PCR obtains full relevance at rank 10 with full structural consistency, significantly outperforming vector search and hybrid retrieval. PCR reduces the average graph distance of retrieved context by 78 percent compared to baselines, demonstrating retrieval of more structurally consistent information. These findings suggest that path-constrained retrieval is an effective approach for improving the reliability and coherence of LLM agent reasoning systems.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Scalable and Accurate Graph Reasoning with LLM-based Multi-Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05130v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling complex graph reasoning tasks. However, due to the intricacies of graph structures and the inherent limitations of LLMs in handling long text, current approaches often fail to deliver satisfactory accuracy, even on small-scale graphs and simple tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce GraphAgent-Reasoner, a fine-tuning-free framework that utilizes a multi-agent collaboration strategy for explicit and precise graph reasoning. Inspired by distributed graph computation theory, our framework decomposes graph problems into smaller, node-centric tasks that are distributed among multiple agents. The agents collaborate to solve the overall problem, significantly reducing the amount of information and complexity handled by a single LLM, thus enhancing the accuracy of graph reasoning. By simply increasing the number of agents, GraphAgent-Reasoner can efficiently scale to accommodate larger graphs with over 1,000 nodes. Evaluated on the GraphInstruct dataset, our framework demonstrates near-perfect accuracy on polynomial-time graph reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming the best available models, both closed-source and fine-tuned open-source variants. Our framework also demonstrates the capability to handle real-world graph reasoning applications such as webpage importance analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 Workshop WMAC</p></details> |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities to augment AAV intelligence. These advances help address complex challenges like area coverage optimization, dynamic path planning, and adaptive decision-making. However, the absence of physical grounding in LLMs leads to hallucination and reproducibility problems in spatial reasoning and decision-making. To tackle these issues, we present Skypilot, an LLM-enhanced two-stage framework that grounds language models in physical reality by integrating monte carlo tree search (MCTS). In the first stage, we introduce a diversified action space that encompasses generate, regenerate, fine-tune, and evaluate operations, coupled with physics-informed reward functions to ensure trajectory feasibility. In the second stage, we fine-tune Qwen3-4B on 23,000 MCTS-generated samples, achieving substantial inference acceleration while maintaining solution quality. Extensive numerical simulations and real-world flight experiments validate the efficiency and superiority of our proposed approach.

| **[LLM Reasoning for Cold-Start Item Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18261v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for improving recommendation systems through their inherent reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base. Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.</p></details> |  |

Software engineering has advanced significantly in recent years with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reliability of LLMs in software engineering is often compromised by ambiguities and inconsistencies due to improper user specification. To address this challenge, we present CodeMetaAgent (CMA), a metamorphic relation-driven LLM agent that systematically refines task specifications and generates semantically constrained test cases. Our proposed framework uses MRs with LLMs to improve generation consistency and reduce variability caused by specifications, unlike the traditional use of MRs as post validations. Our framework has been evaluated on the HumanEval-Pro, MBPP-Pro, and SWE-Bench_Lite datasets using the GPT-4o, Mistral Large, GPT-OSS, and Qwen3-Coder models. It improved code generation accuracy by up to 17% and achieved code coverage gains of up to 99.81%. These results show that metamorphic relations can be a simple but effective guide in assisting LLM-based software development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using LLMs for Late Multimodal Sensor Fusion for Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10729v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensor data streams provide valuable information around activities and context for downstream applications, though integrating complementary information can be challenging. We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used for late fusion for activity classification from audio and motion time series data. We curated a subset of data for diverse activity recognition across contexts (e.g., household activities, sports) from the Ego4D dataset. Evaluated LLMs achieved 12-class zero- and one-shot classification F1-scores significantly above chance, with no task-specific training. Zero-shot classification via LLM-based fusion from modality-specific models can enable multimodal temporal applications where there is limited aligned training data for learning a shared embedding space. Additionally, LLM-based fusion can enable model deploying without requiring additional memory and computation for targeted application-specific multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

A Case Study on Childhood Lead Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18239v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Public health agencies face critical challenges in identifying high-risk neighborhoods for childhood lead exposure with limited resources for outreach and intervention programs. To address this, we develop a Priority Score integrating untested children proportions, elevated blood lead prevalence, and public health coverage patterns to support optimized resource allocation decisions across 136 neighborhoods in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. We leverage these allocation tasks, which require integrating multiple vulnerability indicators and interpreting empirical evidence, to evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) with agentic reasoning and deep research capabilities can effectively allocate public health resources when presented with structured allocation scenarios. LLMs were tasked with distributing 1,000 test kits within each city based on neighborhood vulnerability indicators. Results reveal significant limitations: LLMs frequently overlooked neighborhoods with highest lead prevalence and largest proportions of untested children, such as West Englewood in Chicago, while allocating disproportionate resources to lower-priority areas like Hunts Point in New York City. Overall accuracy averaged 0.46, reaching a maximum of 0.66 with ChatGPT 5 Deep Research. Despite their marketed deep research capabilities, LLMs struggled with fundamental limitations in information retrieval and evidence-based reasoning, frequently citing outdated data and allowing non-empirical narratives about neighborhood conditions to override quantitative vulnerability indicators.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an edge-centric Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework that integrates lightweight machine learning (ML) based IDS models with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to improve detection accuracy, semantic interpretability, and operational efficiency at the network edge. The system evaluates six ML-based IDS models: Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model on low-power edge gateways, achieving accuracy up to 98 percent under real-world cyberattacks. For anomaly detection, the system transmits a compact and secure telemetry snapshot (for example, CPU usage, memory usage, latency, and energy consumption) via low-bandwidth API calls to LLMs including GPT-4-turbo, DeepSeek V2, and LLaMA 3.5. These models use zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought reasoning to produce human-readable threat analyses and actionable mitigation recommendations. Evaluations across diverse attacks such as DoS, DDoS, brute force, and port scanning show that the system enhances interpretability while maintaining low latency (<1.5 s), minimal bandwidth usage (<1.2 kB per prompt), and energy efficiency (<75 J), demonstrating its practicality and scalability as an IDS solution for edge gateways.</p></details> |  |

However, their integration into Hierarchical Planning (HP), a subfield of AP that leverages hierarchical knowledge to enhance planning performance, remains largely unexplored. In this preliminary work, we propose a roadmap to address this gap and harness the potential of LLMs for HP. To this end, we present a taxonomy of integration methods, exploring how LLMs can be utilized within the HP life cycle. Additionally, we provide a benchmark with a standardized dataset for evaluating the performance of future LLM-based HP approaches, and present initial results for a state-of-the-art HP planner and LLM planner. As expected, the latter exhibits limited performance (3\% correct plans, and none with a correct hierarchical decomposition) but serves as a valuable baseline for future approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 0 figures, to be published in the AAAI Workshop on Planning in the Era of LLMs ( https://llmforplanning.github.io )</p></details> |

In this work, we try to address this gap. We present two main contributions. First, we propose L2HP, an extension of L2P (a library to LLM-driven PDDL models generation) that support HP model generation and follows a design philosophy of generality and extensibility. Second, we apply our framework to perform experiments where we compare the modeling capabilities of LLMs for AP and HP. On the PlanBench dataset, results show that parsing success is limited but comparable in both settings (around 36\%), while syntactic validity is substantially lower in the hierarchical case (1\% vs. 20\% of instances).

Training-Free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents via LLM-Guided Program Synthesis in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11425v2)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents in safety-critical applications must continuously adapt to dynamic conditions without compromising performance and reliability. This work introduces TAPA (Training-free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents), a novel framework that positions large language models (LLMs) as intelligent moderators of the symbolic action space. Unlike prior programmatic agents typically generate a monolithic policy program or rely on fixed symbolic action sets, TAPA synthesizes and adapts modular programs for individual high-level actions, referred to as logical primitives. By decoupling strategic intent from execution, TAPA enables meta-agents to operate over an abstract, interpretable action space while the LLM dynamically generates, composes, and refines symbolic programs tailored to each primitive. Extensive experiments across cybersecurity and swarm intelligence domains validate TAPA's effectiveness. In autonomous DDoS defense scenarios, TAPA achieves 77.7% network uptime while maintaining near-perfect detection accuracy in unknown dynamic environments. In swarm intelligence formation control under environmental and adversarial disturbances, TAPA consistently preserves consensus at runtime where baseline methods fail. This work promotes a paradigm shift for autonomous system design in evolving environments, from policy adaptation to dynamic action adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the paper accepted at AAAI-26 Oral to comply with the AAAI camera-ready requirements with minor revisions</p></details> |

In realistic enterprise settings, this involves executing multi-host network attacks spanning many "stepping stone" hosts. Unfortunately, red teams are expensive and entail significant expertise and effort. Given the promise of LLMs in CTF challenges, we first analyze if LLMs can autonomously execute multi-host red team exercises. We find that state-of-the-art LLM-assisted offense systems (e.g., PentestGPT, CyberSecEval3) with leading LLMs (e.g., Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) are unable to do so. Building on our observations in understanding the failure modes of state-of-the-art systems, we argue the need to improve the abstractions and interfaces for LLM-assisted red teaming. Based on this insight, we present the design and implementation of Incalmo, an LLM-assisted system for autonomously red teaming multi-host networks. Incalmo uses LLMs to plan red team exercises in terms of high-level declarative tasks that are executed by domain-specific task agents. Incalmo also uses auxiliary services to manage context and acquired assets. For our evaluation, we develop MHBench, a novel multi-host attack benchmark with 40 realistic emulated networks (from 22 to 50 hosts). We find that Incalmo successfully acquires critical assets (i.e., key hosts or data) in 37 out of 40 MHBench environments. In contrast, state-of-the-art LLM-assisted systems succeed in only 3 out of 40 environments. We show that Incalmo is efficient-successful attacks took 12-54 minutes and cost <$15 in LLM credits.</p></details> | 18 pages, 15 figures |

Step-by-step validation is a promising alternative, yet existing methods are often rigid. They struggle to adapt to diverse reasoning structures, from formal proofs to informal natural language narratives. To address this adaptability gap, we propose the Graph of Verification (GoV), a novel framework for adaptable and multi-granular verification. GoV's core innovation is its flexible "node block" architecture. This mechanism allows GoV to adaptively adjust its verification granularity--from atomic steps for formal tasks to entire paragraphs for natural language--to match the native structure of the reasoning process. This flexibility allows GoV to resolve the fundamental trade-off between verification precision and robustness. Experiments on both well-structured and loosely-structured benchmarks demonstrate GoV's versatility. The results show that GoV's adaptive approach significantly outperforms both holistic baselines and other state-of-the-art decomposition-based methods, establishing a new standard for training-free reasoning verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Towards Harnessing the Power of LLMs for ABAC Policy Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18098v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an empirical investigation into the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform automated Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) policy mining. While ABAC provides fine-grained, context-aware access management, the increasing number and complexity of access policies can make their formulation and evaluation rather challenging. To address the task of synthesizing concise yet accurate policies, we evaluate the performance of some of the state-of-the-art LLMs, specifically Google Gemini (Flash and Pro) and OpenAI ChatGPT, as potential policy mining engines. An experimental framework was developed in Python to generate randomized access data parameterized by varying numbers of subjects, objects, and initial policy sets. The baseline policy sets, which govern permission decisions between subjects and objects, serve as the ground truth for comparison. Each LLM-generated policy was evaluated against the baseline policy using standard performance metrics. The results indicate that LLMs can effectively infer compact and valid ABAC policies for small-scale scenarios. However, as the system size increases, characterized by higher numbers of subjects and objects, LLM outputs exhibit declining accuracy and precision, coupled with significant increase in the size of policy generated, which is beyond the optimal size. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLM architectures for scalable policy mining in access control domains. Future work will explore hybrid approaches that combine prompt optimization with classical rule mining algorithms to improve scalability and interpretability in complex ABAC environments.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area, existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions. To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5% on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior general-purpose and specialized models.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 Oral.

| **[Tree Training: Accelerating Agentic LLMs Training via Shared Prefix Reuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00413v2)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In agentic LLM scenarios, an agent's interaction process during a single rollout often exhibits branching behaviors. Due to memory retrieval and concurrent tool executions at certain decision points, the token trajectory of one task evolves into a tree-like structure rather than a linear sequence. However, current training pipelines decompose such tree-structured trajectories into separate linear segments, treating each branch as an independent sequence. As a result, shared prefixes across these branches are repeatedly recomputed during both forward and backward passes. To address this inefficiency, we propose Tree Training, a paradigm that computes each shared prefix only once and reuses its intermediate results across related branches during both forward and backward passes, substantially improving computation efficiency in large-scale agentic training. This is achieved via (i) Tree Packing, which efficiently reuses shared computations across trajectories, and (ii) Gradient Restoration, which ensures correct gradient propagation across reused prefixes. Experiments on multiple open-source models demonstrate up to 3.9x reduction in total training time, enabling more efficient agentic LLM SFT and RL training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curvature-Aware Safety Restoration In LLMs Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18039v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks often compromises safety alignment, even when using parameter-efficient methods like LoRA. In this work, we uncover a notable property: fine-tuned models preserve the geometric structure of their loss landscapes concerning harmful content, regardless of the fine-tuning method employed. This suggests that safety behaviors are not erased but shifted to less influential regions of the parameter space. Building on this insight, we propose a curvature-aware alignment restoration method that leverages influence functions and second-order optimization to selectively increase loss on harmful inputs while preserving task performance. By navigating the shared geometry between base and fine-tuned models, our method discourages unsafe outputs while preserving task-relevant performance, avoiding full reversion and enabling precise, low-impact updates. Extensive evaluations across multiple model families and adversarial settings show that our approach efficiently reduces harmful responses while maintaining or even improving utility and few-shot learning performance.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated that various testing activities can be performed automatically by large language models (LLMs) with reasonable accuracy. This paper develops a multi-agent system called MASTEST that combines LLM-based and programmed agents to form a complete tool chain that covers the whole workflow of API test starting from generating unit and system test scenarios from API specification in the OpenAPI Swagger format, to generating of Pytest test scripts, executing test scripts to interact with web services, to analysing web service response messages to determine test correctness and calculate test coverage. The system also supports the incorporation of human testers in reviewing and correcting LLM generated test artefacts to ensure the quality of testing activities. MASTEST system is evaluated on two LLMs, GPT-4o and DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner with five public APIs. The performances of LLMs on various testing activities are measured by a wide range of metrics, including unit and system test scenario coverage and API operation coverage for the quality of generated test scenarios, data type correctness, status code coverage and script syntax correctness for the quality of LLM generated test scripts, as well as bug detection ability and usability of LLM generated test scenarios and scripts. Experiment results demonstrated that both DeepSeek and GPT-4o achieved a high overall performance. DeepSeek excels in data type correctness and status code detection, while GPT-4o performs best in API operation coverage. For both models, LLM generated test scripts maintained 100\% syntax correctness and only required minimal manual edits for semantic correctness. These findings indicate the effectiveness and feasibility of MASTEST.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 Pa...</summary><p>14 Page of main text plus 4 pages of appendix</p></details> |
| **[How Far Can LLMs Emulate Human Behavior?: A Strategic Analysis via the Buy-and-Sell Negotiation Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17990v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies have drawn attention to their potential for handling not only simple question-answer tasks but also more complex conversational abilities and performing human-like behavioral imitations. In particular, there is considerable interest in how accurately LLMs can reproduce real human emotions and behaviors, as well as whether such reproductions can function effectively in real-world scenarios. However, existing benchmarks focus primarily on knowledge-based assessment and thus fall short of sufficiently reflecting social interactions and strategic dialogue capabilities. To address these limitations, this work proposes a methodology to quantitatively evaluate the human emotional and behavioral imitation and strategic decision-making capabilities of LLMs by employing a Buy and Sell negotiation simulation. Specifically, we assign different personas to multiple LLMs and conduct negotiations between a Buyer and a Seller, comprehensively analyzing outcomes such as win rates, transaction prices, and SHAP values. Our experimental results show that models with higher existing benchmark scores tend to achieve better negotiation performance overall, although some models exhibit diminished performance in scenarios emphasizing emotional or social contexts. Moreover, competitive and cunning traits prove more advantageous for negotiation outcomes than altruistic and cooperative traits, suggesting that the assigned persona can lead to significant variations in negotiation strategies and results. Consequently, this study introduces a new evaluation approach for LLMs' social behavior imitation and dialogue strategies, and demonstrates how negotiation simulations can serve as a meaningful complementary metric to measure real-world interaction capabilities-an aspect often overlooked in existing benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose and evaluate a method that transforms binary classification tasks into pairwise comparisons between instances within a dataset, using LLMs to produce relative rankings of those instances. Repeated pairwise comparisons can be used to score instances using the Elo rating system (used in chess and other competitions), inducing a confidence ordering over instances in a dataset. We evaluate scheduling algorithms for their ability to minimize comparisons, and show that our proposed algorithm leads to improved classification performance, while also providing more information than traditional zero-shot classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025, Findings).

Recent advancements extend the context window by adjusting the scaling factors of RoPE and fine-tuning. However, suboptimal initialization of these factors results in increased fine-tuning costs and reduced performance at target length. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RoPE-based fine-tuning framework that diverges from conventional scaling factors search. Specifically, we present a \textbf{D}ivide-and-\textbf{C}onquer \textbf{I}ncremental \textbf{S}earch (DCIS) algorithm that strategically determines the better scaling factors. Further fine-tuning with the identified scaling factors effectively extends the context window of LLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our methodology not only mitigates performance decay at extended target lengths but also allows the model to fine-tune on short contexts and generalize to long contexts, thereby reducing the cost of fine-tuning. The scaling factors obtained through DCIS can even perform effectively without fine-tuning. Further analysis of the search space reveals that DCIS achieves twice the search efficiency compared to other methods. We also examine the impact of the non-strictly increasing scaling factors utilized in DCIS and evaluate the general capabilities of LLMs across various context lengths.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Main |

We address this challenge by proposing a two-stage diagnostic framework that enhances transparency, trustworthiness, and reliability. First, we introduce Evidence-Guided Diagnostic Reasoning (EGDR), which guides LLMs to generate structured diagnostic hypotheses by interleaving evidence extraction with logical reasoning grounded in DSM-5 criteria. Second, we propose a Diagnosis Confidence Scoring (DCS) module that evaluates the factual accuracy and logical consistency of generated diagnoses through two interpretable metrics: the Knowledge Attribution Score (KAS) and the Logic Consistency Score (LCS). Evaluated on the D4 dataset with pseudo-labels, EGDR outperforms direct in-context prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) across five LLMs. For instance, on OpenBioLLM, EGDR improves accuracy from 0.31 (Direct) to 0.76 and increases DCS from 0.50 to 0.67. On MedLlama, DCS rises from 0.58 (CoT) to 0.77. Overall, EGDR yields up to +45% accuracy and +36% DCS gains over baseline methods, offering a clinically grounded, interpretable foundation for trustworthy AI-assisted diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient LLM-aware Heterogeneous Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17923v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs are widely present in real-world complex networks, where the diversity of node and relation types leads to complex and rich semantics. Efforts for modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs are restricted by the limitations of predefined semantic dependencies and the scarcity of supervised signals. The advanced pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm leverages graph structure to provide rich self-supervised signals, but introduces semantic gaps between tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential to address the semantic issues of relations and tasks in heterogeneous graphs through their strong reasoning capabilities in textual modality, but their incorporation into heterogeneous graphs is largely limited by computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Efficient LLM-Aware (ELLA) framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the above issues. To capture complex relation semantics, we propose an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer that leverages LLM to encode multi-hop, multi-type relations. To reduce computational complexity, we further employ a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer, which help reduces the complexity of LLM-aware relation reasoning from exponential to linear. To bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we introduce the fine-grained task-aware textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Extensive experiments on four heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed ELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the performance and efficiency. In particular, ELLA scales up to 13b-parameter LLMs and achieves up to a 4x speedup compared with existing LLM-based methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/l-wd/ELLA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Token-Controlled Re-ranking for Sequential Recommendation via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17913v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as re-rankers is shifting recommender systems towards a user-centric paradigm. However, a significant gap remains: current re-rankers often lack mechanisms for fine-grained user control. They struggle to balance inherent user preferences with multiple attribute-based constraints, often resorting to simplistic hard filtering that can excessively narrow the recommendation pool and yield suboptimal results. This limitation leaves users as passive recipients rather than active collaborators in the recommendation process. To bridge this gap, we propose COREC, a novel token-augmented re-ranking framework that incorporates specific user requirements in co-creating the recommendation outcome. COREC empowers users to steer re-ranking results with precise and flexible control via explicit, attribute-based signals. The framework learns to balance these commands against latent preferences, yielding rankings that adhere to user instructions without sacrificing personalization. Experiments show that COREC: (1) exceeds state-of-the-art baselines on standard recommendation effectiveness and (2) demonstrates superior adherence to specific attribute requirements, proving that COREC enables fine-grained and predictable manipulation of the rankings.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches (e.g., SafeCoder) to improve secure code generation are limited by small, imbalanced instruction-tuning datasets. In this work, we present Secure-Instruct, a novel pipeline that automatically synthesizes high-quality vulnerable and secure code examples and instruction-tunes LLMs to align task description and secure code generation abilities. We evaluate Secure-Instruct on four representative LLMs using two security-related benchmarks: our own CWEBench and the existing CWEval. CWEBench comprises 93 scenarios on 44 CWEs, all without overlap with Secure-Instruct's synthetic instruction-tuning dataset, while CWEval covers 31 CWEs with 119 manually verified security-critical tasks. We find that Secure-Instruct improves both security and functional correctness in code generation. On CWEBench, Secure-Instruct substantially improves secure code generation, giving a 28.5% increase on average in secure ratio over the pre-trained models and outperforms SafeCoder by 12.6%. On CWEval, Secure-Instruct achieves an increase of 157.3% for CodeLlama-7B and 46.4% for Mistral-7B in Func-Sec@1 over pretrained models, and significantly outperforms SafeCoder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Hallucinations in LLM-Generated Code via Semantic Triangulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12288v2)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When generating code from natural language prompts, an LLM samples programs from a probability distribution, many of which might be incorrect. Sample consensus techniques - such as majority voting or validation against generated tests or specifications - aim to identify a correct program in the sample or abstain if none is valid. However, existing methods often fail to select a correct solution when its sampling probability is low, or when the problem permits multiple valid but non-equivalent solutions. Additionally, they often fail to abstain when no correct solution is present in the sample. To overcome these limitations, we introduce semantic triangulation, which transforms a programming problem in a way that non-trivially alters its semantics while preserving an exact, verifiable mapping between solutions before and after transformation. We theoretically establish that verifying consistency across such problem transformations increases confidence that generated programs reflect accurate generalization rather than spurious statistical correlations, enabling more reliable sample consensus and abstention. On the LiveCodeBench and CodeElo benchmarks, using GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 models, semantic triangulation increases reliability of generated code by 21% compared to the method that selects only high-confidence solutions with the probability threshold 0.5, while being able to pinpoint correct solutions at sampling probabilities as low as 0.14. Apart from that, it is also the only approach to consistently form true consensus on tasks with multiple valid but non-equivalent solutions.</p></details> |  |

By constructing LLM Agents equipped with various functional modules, we replicate three representative survey experiments involving several expectations across different types of economic agents. Our results show that although the expectations simulated by LLM Agents are more homogeneous than those of humans, they consistently outperform LLMs relying simply on prompt engineering, and possess human-like mental mechanisms. Evaluation reveals that these capabilities stem from the contributions of their components, offering guidelines for their architectural design. Our approach complements traditional methods and provides new insights into AI behavioral science in macroeconomic research</p></details> |  |

While the increasing prevalence of LLM-powered applications provides users with unprecedented convenience, it also brings forth new security challenges. For such an emerging ecosystem, the security community lacks sufficient understanding of the LLM application ecosystem, especially regarding the capability boundaries of the applications themselves. In this paper, we systematically analyzed the new development paradigm and defined the concept of the LLM app capability space. We also uncovered potential new risks beyond jailbreak that arise from ambiguous capability boundaries in real-world scenarios, namely, capability downgrade and upgrade. To evaluate the impact of these risks, we designed and implemented an LLM app capability evaluation framework, LLMApp-Eval. First, we collected application metadata across 4 platforms and conducted a cross-platform ecosystem analysis. Then, we evaluated the risks for 199 popular applications among 4 platforms and 6 open-source LLMs. We identified that 178 (89.45%) potentially affected applications, which can perform tasks from more than 15 scenarios or be malicious. We even found 17 applications in our study that executed malicious tasks directly, without applying any adversarial rewriting. Furthermore, our experiments also reveal a positive correlation between the quality of prompt design and application robustness. We found that well-designed prompts enhance security, while poorly designed ones can facilitate abuse. We hope our work inspires the community to focus on the real-world risks of LLM applications and foster the development of a more robust LLM application ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium 2026</p></details> |

Automatic text simplification solutions, including advanced large language models (LLMs), however, continue to face challenges in reliably arbitrating the tension between optimizing readability performance and ensuring preservation of discourse fidelity. This report empirically assesses two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating how they navigate the readability-accuracy tension compared to a human benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral-Small 3 24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify an architectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a tempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a suite of metrics while preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also attains enhanced readability performance and a reasonable BERTScore of 0.89, but its operational strategy shows a disconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy. Additionally, a comprehensive correlation analysis of a suite of 21 metrics spanning readability, discourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for mechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies, and informs metric selection and domain adaptation for text simplification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid LLM Routing for Efficient App Feedback Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08250v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs), pre-trained on massive datasets, has demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text classification. While prior studies have examined the use of LLMs for predicting the intent of user feedback and reported encouraging results, these investigations remain limited in scope. Furthermore, the vast volume of feedback posted daily, particularly for popular applications, combined with the computational and financial overhead of commercial LLMs, renders large-scale deployment impractical. In contrast, smaller models provide greater efficiency and lower cost but generally at the expense of reduced accuracy. In this paper, we aim to balance accuracy and efficiency in feedback classification. We first present a comprehensive study of zero-shot classification using four widely adopted LLMs, GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, Flan-T5, and Llama3-70B, on diverse feedback datasets collected from multiple platforms, including app stores, forums, and X, which are categorized under different schemes. This analysis reveals how classification scheme design and platform characteristics influence the predictive performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose a two-tier routing strategy for scalable app store feedback classification. In this approach, low-complexity instances are processed by lightweight fine-tuned models, while ambiguous cases are routed to high-capacity LLMs for more reliable decisions. Experimental results show that this strategy retains 98.4% to 100.4% of zero-shot LLM accuracy while reducing request and token costs by 67.8% and 66.3%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, they often fail to capture the precise, reusable expertise that engineers apply, leading to inaccurate responses. We propose GROVE, a hierarchical knowledge management framework that learns and organizes reusable debugging expertise into an LLM-organized knowledge tree for solving assertion failures. GROVE distills debugging knowledge from prior cases and organizes it into a vertical tree of configurable depth, with each node encoding a concise knowledge item and explicit applicability conditions. During training, GROVE uses a parallel, gradient-free loop where an LLM proposes tree modifications as structured JSON edits by learning from the cases. At test time, a budget-aware iterative zoom is performed to navigate the tree, retrieving a small set of applicable knowledge items that guide a base LLM's hypothesis generation and fix proposals. Evaluated on a suite of assertion-failure cases, GROVE delivers consistent gains in pass@1 and pass@5, demonstrating the value of structured knowledge evolution.</p></details> |  |

As such, OPE plays a critical role in ensuring safety in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. However, standard OPE approaches are limited by the size and coverage of the behavior dataset. While previous work has explored using expert-labeled counterfactual annotations to enhance dataset coverage, obtaining such annotations is expensive, limiting the scalability of prior approaches. We propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate counterfactual annotations for OPE in medical domains. Our method uses domain knowledge to guide LLMs in predicting how key clinical features evolve under alternate treatments. These predicted features can then be transformed using known reward functions to create counterfactual annotations. We first evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict clinical features across two patient subsets in MIMIC-IV, finding that state-of-the-art LLMs achieve comparable performance. Building on this capacity to predict clinical features, we generate LLM-based counterfactual annotations and incorporate them into an OPE estimator. Our empirical results analyze the benefits of counterfactual annotations under varying degrees of shift between the behavior and target policies. We find that in most cases, the LLM-based counterfactual annotations significantly improve OPE estimates up to a point. We provide an entropy-based metric to identify when additional annotations cease to be useful. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based counterfactual annotations offer a scalable approach for addressing coverage limitations in healthcare datasets, enabling safer deployment of decision-making policies in clinical settings.</p></details> |  |

We release three local government deliberation datasets: Appellate Court hearings, School Board meetings, and Municipal Council sessions. Fine-tuning LLMs to model specific participants using this "action-aware" data produces a 67% reduction in perplexity and nearly doubles classifier-based performance metrics for speaker fidelity and realism.

Built on the Transformer architecture, these models are trained on extensive datasets, enabling them to understand and generate human language effectively. In the financial domain, the deployment of LLMs is gaining momentum. These models are being utilized for automating financial report generation, forecasting market trends, analyzing investor sentiment, and offering personalized financial advice. Leveraging their natural language processing capabilities, LLMs can distill key insights from vast financial data, aiding institutions in making informed investment choices and enhancing both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. In this study, we provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging integration of LLMs into various financial tasks. Additionally, we conducted holistic tests on multiple financial tasks through the combination of natural language instructions. Our findings show that GPT-4 effectively follow prompt instructions across various financial tasks.

Different methods have been proposed to mitigate such hallucinations and fragility, one of which is to measure the consistency of LLM responses -- the model's confidence in the response or likelihood of generating a similar response when resampled. In previous work, measuring LLM response consistency often relied on calculating the probability of a response appearing within a pool of resampled responses, analyzing internal states, or evaluating logits of responses. However, it was not clear how well these approaches approximated users' perceptions of consistency of LLM responses. To find out, we performed a user study ($n=2,976$) demonstrating that current methods for measuring LLM response consistency typically do not align well with humans' perceptions of LLM consistency. We propose a logit-based ensemble method for estimating LLM consistency and show that our method matches the performance of the best-performing existing metric in estimating human ratings of LLM consistency.

To investigate these risks, we introduce a news-image benchmark consisting of 1,343 image-question pairs drawn from diverse outlets, which we annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes (age, gender, race, occupation, and sports). We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art VLMs and employ a large language model (LLM) as judge, with human verification. Our findings show that: (i) visual context systematically shifts model outputs in open-ended settings; (ii) bias prevalence varies across attributes and models, with particularly high risk for gender and occupation; and (iii) higher faithfulness does not necessarily correspond to lower bias. We release the benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and fairness-aware multimodal assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Workshop (Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle)</p></details> |

We present LiveCLKTBench, an automated generation pipeline specifically designed to isolate and measure cross-lingual knowledge transfer. Our pipeline identifies self-contained, time-sensitive knowledge entities from real-world domains, filters them based on temporal occurrence, and verifies them against the model's knowledge. The documents of these valid entities are then used to generate factual questions, which are translated into multiple languages to evaluate transferability across linguistic boundaries. Using LiveCLKTBench, we evaluate several LLMs across five languages and observe that cross-lingual transfer is strongly influenced by linguistic distance and often asymmetric across language directions. While larger models improve transfer, the gains diminish with scale and vary across domains. These findings provide new insights into multilingual transfer and demonstrate the value of LiveCLKTBench as a reliable benchmark for future research.</p></details> |  |

Generative LLMs like GPT and Claude are increasingly being used as content analytical tools, but how effective are they for frame analysis? We address this question by systematically evaluating them against their computational predecessors: bag-of-words models and encoder-only transformers; and traditional manual coding procedures. Our analysis rests on a novel gold standard dataset that we inductively and iteratively developed through the study, investigating six months of news coverage of the US Mpox epidemic of 2022. While we discover some potential applications for generative LLMs, we demonstrate that they were consistently outperformed by manual coders, and in some instances, by smaller language models. Some form of human validation was always necessary to determine appropriate model choice. Additionally, by examining how the suitability of various approaches depended on the nature of different tasks that were part of our frame analytical workflow, we provide insights as to how researchers may leverage the complementarity of these approaches to use them in tandem. We conclude by endorsing a methodologically pluralistic approach and put forth a roadmap for computational frame analysis for researchers going forward.</p></details> |  |

This sector faces increasing operational pressures amidst rising immigration targets, which highlights a need for enhanced efficiency and innovation, potentially through reliable AI solutions. The ad-hoc use of general-purpose generative AI, such as ChatGPT, might become a common practice among newcomers and service providers to address this need. However, these tools are not tailored for the settlement domain and can have detrimental implications for immigrants and refugees. We explore the risks that these tools might pose on newcomers to first, warn against the unguarded use of generative AI, and second, to incentivize further research and development in creating AI literacy programs as well as customized LLMs that are aligned with the preferences of the impacted communities. Crucially, such technologies should be designed to integrate seamlessly into the existing workflow of the settlement sector, ensuring human oversight, trustworthiness, and accountability.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Drift No More? Context Equilibria in Multi-Turn LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07777v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns. Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $τ$-Bench, measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators. Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together, these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.</p></details> |  |

In our approach, the agent embodies the user's "persona" (e.g. user profile or taste) and is powered by a large language model (LLM). To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user's historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge. On the LaMP benchmark, our method improves news categorization F1 by 11.1%, movie tagging F1 by 56.1%, and reduces product rating MAE by 10.4% over prior methods.

The present study addresses this question from the perspective of lexical diversity. Specifically, the study investigates patterns of lexical diversity in LLM-generated texts from four ChatGPT models (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-o4 mini, and ChatGPT-4.5) in comparison with texts written by L1 and L2 English participants (n = 240) across four education levels. Six dimensions of lexical diversity were measured in each text: volume, abundance, variety-repetition, evenness, disparity, and dispersion. Results from one-way MANOVAs, one-way ANOVAs, and Support Vector Machines revealed that the ChatGPT-generated texts differed significantly from human-written texts for each variable, with ChatGPT-o4 mini and ChatGPT-4.5 differing the most. Within these two groups, ChatGPT-4.5 demonstrated higher levels of lexical diversity than older models despite producing fewer tokens. The human writers' lexical diversity did not differ across subgroups (i.e., education, language status). Altogether, the results indicate that ChatGPT models do not produce human-like texts in relation to lexical diversity, and the newer models produce less human-like text than older models. We discuss the implications of these results for language pedagogy and related applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches face trade-offs between generality and specialization, and practical deployments reveal challenges such as hallucinations, context limitations, and ethical concerns. In this work, we introduce a novel command & control (C2) architecture leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to coordinate distributed, adaptive reconnaissance agents covertly across networks. Notably, we find that our architecture not only improves goal-directed behavior of the system as whole, but also eliminates key host and network artifacts that can be used to detect and prevent command & control behavior altogether. We begin with a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art generative red teaming methods, from fine-tuned specialist models to modular or agentic frameworks, analyzing their automation capabilities against task-specific accuracy. We then detail how our MCP-based C2 can overcome current limitations by enabling asynchronous, parallel operations and real-time intelligence sharing without periodic beaconing. We furthermore explore advanced adversarial capabilities of this architecture, its detection-evasion techniques, and address dual-use ethical implications, proposing defensive measures and controlled evaluation in lab settings. Experimental comparisons with traditional C2 show drastic reductions in manual effort and detection footprint. We conclude with future directions for integrating autonomous exploitation, defensive LLM agents, predictive evasive maneuvers, and multi-agent swarms. The proposed MCP-enabled C2 framework demonstrates a significant step toward realistic, AI-driven red team operations that can simulate advanced persistent threats while informing the development of next-generation defensive systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables.

These models include unimodal vision encoders trained on a single data modality and multimodal architectures trained on combinations of SAR, multispectral, hyperspectral, and image-text data. They support diverse RS tasks including semantic segmentation, image classification, change detection, and visual question answering. However, selecting an appropriate remote sensing foundation model (RSFM) remains difficult due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints. We introduce the RSFM Database (RS-FMD), a structured resource covering over 150 RSFMs spanning multiple data modalities, resolutions, and learning paradigms. Built on RS-FMD, we present REMSA, the first LLM-based agent for automated RSFM selection from natural language queries. REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol. REMSA outperforms several baselines, including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs. It operates entirely on publicly available metadata and does not access private or sensitive data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/be-chen/REMSA</p></details> |

This leads to new State-of-the-Art performance on the recent MMAU and MMAR benchmarks. Omni-R1 achieves the highest accuracies on the sounds, music, speech, and overall average categories, both on the Test-mini and Test-full splits. To understand the performance improvement, we tested models both with and without audio and found that much of the performance improvement from GRPO could be attributed to better text-based reasoning. We also made a surprising discovery that fine-tuning without audio on a text-only dataset was effective at improving the audio-based performance.</p></details> |  |

This paper focuses on human-robot interaction (HRI) based on human-robot dialogue that relies on the robot action confirmation and action step generation using multimodal scene understanding. The state-of-the-art approach uses multimodal transformers to generate robot action steps aligned with robot action confirmation from a single clip showing a task composed of multiple micro steps. Although actions towards a long-horizon task depend on each other throughout an entire video, the current approaches mainly focus on clip-level processing and do not leverage long-context information. This paper proposes a long-context Q-former incorporating left and right context dependency in full videos. Furthermore, this paper proposes a text-conditioning approach to feed text embeddings directly into the LLM decoder to mitigate the high abstraction of the information in text by Q-former. Experiments with the YouCook2 corpus show that the accuracy of confirmation generation is a major factor in the performance of action planning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the long-context Q-former improves the confirmation and action planning by integrating VideoLLaMA3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASRU 2025</p></details> |

Nevertheless, most MLLMs suffer from limited spatial reasoning ability to interpret and infer spatial arrangements in three-dimensional space. In this work, we propose a novel vision encoder based on hierarchical fusion of geometry and semantics features, generating spatial-aware visual embedding and boosting the spatial grounding capability of MLLMs. Specifically, we first unveil that the spatial ambiguity shortcoming stems from the lossy embedding of the vision encoder utilized in most existing MLLMs (e.g., CLIP), restricted to instance-level semantic features. This motivates us to complement CLIP with the geometry features from vision-only self-supervised learning via a hierarchical adapter, enhancing the spatial awareness in the proposed SpatialGeo. The network is efficiently trained using pretrained LLaVA model and optimized with random feature dropping to avoid trivial solutions relying solely on the CLIP encoder. Experimental results show that SpatialGeo improves the accuracy in spatial reasoning tasks, enhancing state-of-the-art models by at least 8.0% in SpatialRGPT-Bench with approximately 50% less memory cost during inference.

While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for dynamic feedback generation, they risk producing hallucinations or pedagogically unsound explanations. We evaluated the stepwise accuracy of LLMs in constructing multi-step symbolic logic proofs, comparing six prompting techniques across four state-of-the-art LLMs on 358 propositional logic problems. Results show that DeepSeek-V3 achieved superior performance up to 86.7% accuracy on stepwise proof construction and excelled particularly in simpler rules. We further used the best-performing LLM to generate explanatory hints for 1,050 unique student problem-solving states from a logic ITS and evaluated them on 4 criteria with both an LLM grader and human expert ratings on a 20% sample. Our analysis finds that LLM-generated hints were 75% accurate and rated highly by human evaluators on consistency and clarity, but did not perform as well explaining why the hint was provided or its larger context. Our results demonstrate that LLMs may be used to augment tutoring systems with logic tutoring hints, but require additional modifications to ensure accuracy and pedagogical appropriateness.</p></details> |  |

Supervised and contrastive approaches rely on data with spurious correlations and often confuse style with topic. Despite their natural use in AI-generated text detection, the CLM pre-training of modern LLMs has been scarcely leveraged for general authorship problems. We propose a novel unsupervised approach based on this extensive pre-training and the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, employing the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability from one text to another. Our method significantly outperforms LLM prompting approaches of comparable scale and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively trained baselines when controlling for topical correlations. Moreover, performance scales fairly consistently with the size of the base model and, in the case of authorship verification, with an additional mechanism that increases test-time computation; enabling flexible trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlsReuse: LLM-Powered Serverless Function Reuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17262v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has rapidly emerged as a popular cloud computing paradigm. It enables developers to implement function-level tasks, i.e., serverless functions, without managing infrastructure. While reducing operational overhead, it poses challenges, especially for novice developers. Developing functions from scratch requires adapting to heterogeneous, platform-specific programming styles, making the process time-consuming and error-prone. Function reuse offers a promising solution to address these challenges. However, research on serverless computing lacks a dedicated approach for function recommendation. Existing techniques from traditional contexts remain insufficient due to the semantic gap between task descriptions and heterogeneous function implementations. Advances in large language models (LLMs), pre-trained on large-scale corpora, create opportunities to bridge this gap by aligning developer requirements with function semantics. This paper presents SlsReuse, the first LLM-powered framework for serverless function reuse. Specifically, SlsReuse first constructs a reusable function repository serving as a foundational knowledge base. Then, it learns unified semantic-enhanced representations of heterogeneous functions through effective prompt engineering with few-shot prompting, capturing implicit code intent, target platforms, programming languages, and cloud services. Finally, given a natural language task query, SlsReuse performs intent-aware discovery combined with a multi-level pruning strategy and similarity matching. We evaluate SlsReuse on a curated dataset of 110 task queries. Built on ChatGPT-4o, one of the most representative LLMs, SlsReuse achieves Recall@10 of 91.20%, exceeding the state-of-the-art baseline by 24.53 percentage points.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs excel at general-purpose code generation, the unique constraints of Smart Contracts, such as gas consumption, security, and determinism, raise open questions about the reliability of LLM-generated Solidity code. Existing studies lack a comprehensive evaluation of these critical functional and non-functional properties. We benchmark four state-of-the-art models under zero-shot and retrieval-augmented generation settings across 500 real-world functions. Our multi-faceted assessment employs code similarity metrics, semantic embeddings, automated test execution, gas profiling, and cognitive and cyclomatic complexity analysis. Results show that while LLMs produce code with high semantic similarity to real contracts, their functional correctness is low: only 20% to 26% of zero-shot generations behave identically to ground-truth implementations under testing. The generated code is consistently simpler, with significantly lower complexity and gas consumption, often due to omitted validation logic. Retrieval-Augmented Generation markedly improves performance, boosting functional correctness by up to 45% and yielding more concise and efficient code. Our findings reveal a significant gap between semantic similarity and functional plausibility in LLM-generated Smart Contracts. We conclude that while RAG is a powerful enhancer, achieving robust, production-ready code generation remains a substantial challenge, necessitating careful expert validation.</p></details> | 20 pages |

To address these challenges, researchers have turned towards integrating tools into LLM-powered agents to enhance the overall information fusion process. However, the conjunction of these technologies and the proposed enhancements in several state-of-the-art works followed a non-unified software architecture, resulting in a lack of modularity and terminological inconsistencies among researchers. To address these issues, we propose a novel LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework (LLM-Agent-UMF) that establishes a clear foundation for agent development from both functional and software architectural perspectives, developed and evaluated using the Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Framework (ATRAF). Our framework clearly distinguishes between the different components of an LLM-based agent, setting LLMs and tools apart from a new element, the core-agent, which plays the role of central coordinator. This pivotal entity comprises five modules: planning, memory, profile, action, and security -- the latter often neglected in previous works. By classifying core-agents into passive and active types based on their authoritative natures, we propose various multi-core agent architectures that combine unique characteristics of distinctive agents to tackle complex tasks more efficiently. We evaluate our framework by applying it to thirteen state-of-the-art agents, thereby demonstrating its alignment with their functionalities and clarifying overlooked architectural aspects. Moreover, we thoroughly assess five architecture variants of our framework by designing new agent architectures that combine characteristics of state-of-the-art agents to address specific goals. ...</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 19 figures, 3 tables.

| **[LLM Collaboration With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04652v4)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenMLRL/CoMLRL.</p></details> |  |

PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low "follow rates" ($\leq 11\%$, GPT-5: 4\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of "resistance to overfitting pressure" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Yet Strong Baseline for Long-Term Conversational Memory of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17208v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based conversational agents still struggle to maintain coherent, personalized interaction over many sessions: fixed context windows limit how much history can be kept in view, and most external memory approaches trade off between coarse retrieval over large chunks and fine-grained but fragmented views of the dialogue. Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/KevinSRR/EMem.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques. Our findings thus emphasize the urgent need for new approaches explicitly designed to address hallucinations caused by spurious correlations.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing LLMs generate test cases one token at a time in each forward pass, which leads to inefficient UTG. Recently, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have emerged, offering promising parallel generation capabilities and showing strong potential for efficient UTG. Despite this advantage, their application to UTG is still constrained by a clear trade-off between efficiency and test quality, since increasing the number of tokens generated in each step often causes a sharp decline in the quality of test cases. To overcome this limitation, we present DiffTester, an acceleration framework specifically tailored for dLLMs in UTG. The key idea of DiffTester is that unit tests targeting the same focal method often share repetitive structural patterns. By dynamically identifying these common patterns through abstract syntax tree analysis during generation, DiffTester adaptively increases the number of tokens produced at each step without compromising the quality of the output. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we extend the original TestEval benchmark, which was limited to Python, by introducing additional programming languages including Java and C++. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with two representative models show that DiffTester delivers significant acceleration while preserving test coverage. Moreover, DiffTester generalizes well across different dLLMs and programming languages, providing a practical and scalable solution for efficient UTG in software development.

| **[A Counterfactual LLM Framework for Detecting Human Biases: A Case Study of Sex/Gender in Emergency Triage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17124v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel, domain-agnostic counterfactual approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify gender disparities in human clinical decision-making. The method trains an LLM to emulate observed decisions, then evaluates counterfactual pairs in which only gender is flipped, estimating directional disparities while holding all other clinical factors constant. We study emergency triage, validating the approach on more than 150,000 admissions to the Bordeaux University Hospital (France) and replicating results on a subset of MIMIC-IV across a different language, population, and healthcare system. In the Bordeaux cohort, otherwise identical presentations were approximately 2.1% more likely to receive a lower-severity triage score when presented as female rather than male; scaled to national emergency volumes in France, this corresponds to more than 200,000 lower-severity assignments per year. Modality-specific analyses indicate that both explicit tabular gender indicators and implicit textual gender cues contribute to the disparity. Beyond emergency care, the approach supports bias audits in other settings (e.g., hiring, academic, and justice decisions), providing a scalable tool to detect and address inequities in real-world decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review at npj Digital Medicine</p></details> |
| **[How LLMs Learn to Reason: A Complex Network Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23629v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, a V-shaped response-length trajectory, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these behaviors are emergent collective phenomena governed not by neural implementation details, but by the topological evolution of the latent reasoning graph in semantic space. By demonstrating a dynamical isomorphism between a 1.5B-parameter LLM and a minimal Concept Network Model (CoNet), we trace the causal source to the self-organization of a sparse concept web pinned to an average degree of two. This geometric perspective provides a unified physical explanation for the observed anomalies: the V-shaped trajectory tracks the evolution from parallel local skill optimization to global network integration; catastrophic forgetting stems from the topological disconnection of critical ``trunk'' edges; and policy collapse arises from the accumulation of sequential transitions at the web's leaf nodes, where broad exploration abruptly freezes into rigid, high-reward trajectories. Identifying a ``maximally frustrated state'' at the transition between learning stages, we propose Annealed-RLVR, a principled algorithm that injects a targeted SFT ``heating'' step to resolve this topological bottleneck. Experiments confirm that this theory-driven intervention outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks (including Minerva and AIME). By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, 1 table, under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

This paper presents an empirical study analyzing the energy consumption and carbon footprint of large language model (LLM) inference across four countries: the United Arab Emirates, Iceland, Germany, and the United States of America using DeepSeek Coder 1.3B and the HumanEval dataset on the task of code generation. We use the CodeCarbon library to track energy and carbon emissions andcompare geographical trade-offs for climate-aware AI deployment.

| **[Aligning Vision to Language: Annotation-Free Multimodal Knowledge Graph Construction for Enhanced LLMs Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12972v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) struggles with incomplete knowledge and hallucination artifacts, challenges that textual Knowledge Graphs (KGs) only partially mitigate due to their modality isolation. While Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) promise enhanced cross-modal understanding, their practical construction is impeded by semantic narrowness of manual text annotations and inherent noise in visual-semantic entity linkages. In this paper, we propose Vision-align-to-Language integrated Knowledge Graph (VaLiK), a novel approach for constructing MMKGs that enhances LLMs reasoning through cross-modal information supplementation. Specifically, we cascade pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align image features with text, transforming them into descriptions that encapsulate image-specific information. Furthermore, we developed a cross-modal similarity verification mechanism to quantify semantic consistency, effectively filtering out noise introduced during feature alignment. Even without manually annotated image captions, the refined descriptions alone suffice to construct the MMKG. Compared to conventional MMKGs construction paradigms, our approach achieves substantial storage efficiency gains while maintaining direct entity-to-image linkage capability. Experimental results on multimodal reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMs augmented with VaLiK outperform previous state-of-the-art models. Our code is published at https://github.com/Wings-Of-Disaster/VaLiK.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables; Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[CLLMRec: LLM-powered Cognitive-Aware Concept Recommendation via Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17041v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) presents significant challenges for personalized learning, where concept recommendation is crucial. Existing approaches typically rely on heterogeneous information networks or knowledge graphs to capture conceptual relationships, combined with knowledge tracing models to assess learners' cognitive states. However, these methods face significant limitations due to their dependence on high-quality structured knowledge graphs, which are often scarce in real-world educational scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper proposes CLLMRec, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models through two synergistic technical pillars: Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation. The Semantic Alignment component constructs a unified representation space by encoding unstructured textual descriptions of learners and concepts. The Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation paradigm employs a teacher-student architecture, where a large teacher LLM (implemented as the Prior Knowledge Aware Component) extracts conceptual prerequisite relationships from its internalized world knowledge and distills them into soft labels to train an efficient student ranker. Building upon these foundations, our framework incorporates a fine-ranking mechanism that explicitly models learners' real-time cognitive states through deep knowledge tracing, ensuring recommendations are both structurally sound and cognitively appropriate. Extensive experiments on two real-world MOOC datasets demonstrate that CLLMRec significantly outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in generating truly cognitive-aware and personalized concept recommendations without relying on explicit structural priors.</p></details> |  |

SpecActor achieves fast rollout with speculative decoding that deploys a fast path (e.g., a smaller model) to accelerate the unparallelizable generation, while the correctness is guaranteed by fast parallel verification of the outputs with the original model. SpecActor addresses two foundational challenges in speculative rollout by (1) a \emph{dynamic decoupled speculation} execution method that maximizes the GPU computational efficiency to realize speedup for large-batch execution -- a configuration common in training but unfriendly to speculative execution and (2) a \emph{dynamic Best-of-N speculation} method that selects and combines different drafting methods according to the rollout progress. It substantially improves the speculation accuracy even when the best drafting method is unknown a priori, meanwhile without requiring adding extra computation resources. {\sys} is {1.7}\,$\times$ faster than veRL in end-to-end training, and is {1.3--1.5}\,$\times$ faster compared to baselines with speculative decoding.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM and Agent-Driven Data Analysis: A Systematic Approach for Enterprise Applications and System-level Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17676v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress in Generative AI and Agent technologies is profoundly transforming enterprise data management and analytics. Traditional database applications and system deployment are fundamentally impacted by AI-driven tools, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector database technologies, which provide new pathways for semantic querying over enterprise knowledge bases. In the meantime, data security and compliance are top priorities for organizations adopting AI technologies. For enterprise data analysis, SQL generations powered by large language models (LLMs) and AI agents, has emerged as a key bridge connecting natural language with structured data, effectively lowering the barrier to enterprise data access and improving analytical efficiency. This paper focuses on enterprise data analysis applications and system deployment, covering a range of innovative frameworks, enabling complex query understanding, multi-agent collaboration, security verification, and computational efficiency. Through representative use cases, key challenges related to distributed deployment, data security, and inherent difficulties in SQL generation tasks are discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[KRAL: Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning for LLM-assisted Clinical Antimicrobial Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15974v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles,host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials,and the severity of infection. This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at about 20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing PyTorch Inference with LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16964v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maximizing performance on available GPU hardware is an ongoing challenge for modern AI inference systems. Traditional approaches include writing custom GPU kernels and using specialized model compilers to tune high-level code for specific GPU targets. Recent work shows that LLM-based multi-agent systems can effectively perform such tuning, often outperforming existing compilers and eliminating the need for manual kernel development. However, the dynamics of multi-agent systems for this task remain unexplored. In this work, we present a logical framework for comparing multi-agent PyTorch optimization systems. Our evaluation shows that exploit-heavy strategies perform best when paired with error-fixing agents, and that performance correlates with the granularity of optimization steps. The best implementation achieves an average 2.88x speedup on an H100 GPU across diverse tasks in KernelBench, a benchmark suite covering a range of machine learning architectures in PyTorch.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Symbolic Control and Neural Reasoning in LLM Agents: The Structured Cognitive Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17673v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model agents suffer from fundamental architectural problems: entangled reasoning and execution, memory volatility, and uncontrolled action sequences. We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). At the core of SCL is Soft Symbolic Control, an adaptive governance mechanism that applies symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference, preserving neural flexibility while restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.

Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack methods manually design instructions for the LLM to generate adversarial prompts, which effectively bypass safety filters while producing sensitive images, exposing safety vulnerabilities of T2I models. However, due to the LLM's limited understanding of the T2I model and its safety filters, existing methods require numerous queries to achieve a successful attack, limiting their practical applicability. To address this issue, we propose Reason2Attack(R2A), which aims to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities in generating adversarial prompts by incorporating the jailbreaking attack into the post-training process of the LLM. Specifically, we first propose a CoT example synthesis pipeline based on Frame Semantics, which generates adversarial prompts by identifying related terms and corresponding context illustrations. Using CoT examples generated by the pipeline, we fine-tune the LLM to understand the reasoning path and format the output structure. Subsequently, we incorporate the jailbreaking attack task into the reinforcement learning process of the LLM and design an attack process reward that considers prompt length, prompt stealthiness, and prompt effectiveness, aiming to further enhance reasoning accuracy. Extensive experiments on various T2I models show that R2A achieves a better attack success ratio while requiring fewer queries than baselines. Moreover, our adversarial prompts demonstrate strong attack transferability across both open-source and commercial T2I models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Noted...</summary><p>Noted that This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive or distressing material</p></details> |

We present AraFinNews, the largest publicly available Arabic financial news dataset to date, comprising 212,500 article-headline pairs spanning almost a decade of reporting from October 2015 to July 2025. Developed as an Arabic counterpart to major English summarisation corpora such as CNN/DailyMail, AraFinNews offers a strong benchmark for assessing domain-focused language understanding and generation in financial contexts. Using this resource, we evaluate transformer-based models, including mT5, AraT5 and the domain-adapted FinAraT5, to investigate how financial-domain pretraining influences accuracy, numerical reliability and stylistic alignment with professional reporting. The results show that domain-adapted models produce more coherent summaries, particularly when handling quantitative and entity-centred information. These findings underscore the value of domain-specific adaptation for improving narrative fluency in Arabic financial summarisation.

| **[A Causal Perspective on Measuring, Explaining and Mitigating Smells in LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15817v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code. This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.</p></details> |  |

However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026.

The recent work Soft Thinking has shown that LLMs' latent reasoning via soft concepts is a promising direction, but LLMs are trained on discrete tokens. To reduce this gap between the soft concepts in reasoning and the discrete tokens in training, we propose Soft Concept Mixing (SCM), a soft concept aware training scheme that directly exposes the model to soft representations during training. Specifically, SCM constructs a soft concept vector by forming a probability-weighted average of embeddings. Then, this vector is mixed into the model's hidden states, which embody rich contextual information. Finally, the entire latent reasoning process is optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SCM improves the reasoning performance of LLMs, and simultaneously maintains a stable training dynamic.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Current LLM selection methods typically optimize for a single fixed objective, such as performance, cost, or a trade-off between them, and fail to learn individual user preferences from interaction data. To address these limitations, we propose PersonalizedRouter, a graph-based framework that models diverse user profiles and performs personalized LLM selection by leveraging interaction data that includes task context, queries, candidate LLMs, and user decisions. To capture contextual information between user queries and optimal LLMs, PersonalizedRouter converts the interaction data into a heterogeneous graph, where the relationships between different types of nodes are represented by edges. To evaluate adaptability across users, we design two strategies: the multi-cost-efficiency simulation strategy and the LLM-as-a-Judge strategy. In addition, we construct PersonaRoute-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with 1,000 simulated users and 10 LLMs. Experimental results show that PersonalizedRouter significantly outperforms existing LLM selection methods and surpasses the strongest methods by a large margin of 15.38% and 9.83% under two simulation strategies. On the PersonaRoute-Bench with 1,000 users, it further surpasses the best methods by 16.19% and 59.69% while maintaining higher efficiency. Moreover, PersonalizedRouter demonstrates strong few-shot generalization, achieving 64.81% and 85.80% of the fully trained model's performance when adapting to new users and new LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing heuristic and learning-based methods struggle with adaptability and sample efficiency. We present LLM-DSE, a multi-agent framework designed specifically for optimizing HLS directives. Combining LLM with design space exploration (DSE), our explorer coordinates four agents: Router, Specialists, Arbitrator, and Critic. These multi-agent components interact with various tools to accelerate the optimization process. LLM-DSE leverages essential domain knowledge to identify efficient parameter combinations while maintaining adaptability through verbal learning from online interactions. Evaluations on the HLSyn dataset demonstrate that LLM-DSE achieves substantial $2.55\times$ performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, uncovering novel designs while reducing runtime.

This diminishes clarity and user satisfaction, and it increases costs for model developers, especially with well-known proprietary models that charge based on the number of output tokens. In this paper, we introduce a novel reference-free metric for evaluating the conciseness of responses generated by LLMs. Our method quantifies non-essential content without relying on gold standard references and calculates the average of three calculations: i) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM abstractive summary; ii) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM extractive summary; and iii) wordremoval compression, where an LLM removes as many non-essential words as possible from the response while preserving its meaning, with the number of tokens removed indicating the conciseness score. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed metric identifies redundancy in LLM outputs, offering a practical tool for automated evaluation of response brevity in conversational AI systems without the need for ground truth human annotations.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the simplicity of retro BASIC, we repurpose numbered lines and simple commands as an interpretable cognitive control layer. Modern LLMs can reliably simulate such short programs, enabling transparent multi-step reasoning inside the model. A natural-language interpreter file specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. Our mental-model interpreter extracts declarative and procedural knowledge, detects contradictions, and produces resolutions when necessary.

While recent work has focused on using LLMs to improve review efficiency, unchecked deficient reviews from both human experts and AI systems threaten to systematically undermine academic integrity. To address this issue, we introduce ReviewGuard, an automated system for detecting and categorizing deficient reviews through a four-stage LLM-driven framework: data collection from ICLR and NeurIPS on OpenReview, GPT-4.1 annotation with human validation, synthetic data augmentation yielding 6,634 papers with 24,657 real and 46,438 synthetic reviews, and fine-tuning of encoder-based models and open-source LLMs. Feature analysis reveals that deficient reviews exhibit lower rating scores, higher self-reported confidence, reduced structural complexity, and more negative sentiment than sufficient reviews. AI-generated text detection shows dramatic increases in AI-authored reviews since ChatGPT's emergence. Mixed training with synthetic and real data substantially improves detection performance - for example, Qwen 3-8B achieves recall of 0.6653 and F1 of 0.7073, up from 0.5499 and 0.5606 respectively. This study presents the first LLM-driven system for detecting deficient peer reviews, providing evidence to inform AI governance in peer review.

Here we recast SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting practice, symbol (number) embedding, and gated attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like'' use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Formal Verification of LLM-Generated Code from Natural Language Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13290v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the past few years LLMs have emerged as a tool that can aid programmers by taking natural language descriptions and generating code based on it. However, the reliability of LLM code generation and current validation techniques for it are far from strong enough to be used for mission-critical or safety-critical applications. In this work we explore ways to offer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees could improve the quality of general AI Code Assistants and support their use for critical applications. To address this challenge we propose to incorporate a Formal Query Language that can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural language-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. We then have a formal specification of the user intent which we can use to verify that LLM-generated code matches the user's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the Ansible programming language, widely used for system administration, including for critical systems. The system includes an intuitive formal query language, a calculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic interpreter and a unification algorithm which together are used for the verification.

| **[When Structure Doesn't Help: LLMs Do Not Read Text-Attributed Graphs as Effectively as We Expected](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16767v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs provide a unified representation of semantic content and relational structure, making them a natural fit for domains such as molecular modeling, citation networks, and social graphs. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era. Our study is to systematically challenge the foundational assumption that structure is inherently beneficial for LLM-based graph reasoning, opening the door to new, semantics-driven approaches for graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Recent work on model compression through pruning and knowledge distillation has reduced this cost; however, this process still incurs hundreds of billions of tokens worth of training cost per compressed model. In this paper, we present Nemotron Elastic, a framework for building reasoning-oriented LLMs, including hybrid Mamba-Attention architectures, that embed multiple nested submodels within a single parent model, each optimized for different deployment configurations and budgets. Each of these submodels shares weights with the parent model and can be extracted zero-shot during deployment without additional training or fine-tuning. We enable this functionality through an end-to-end trained router, tightly coupled to a two-stage training curriculum designed specifically for reasoning models. We additionally introduce group-aware SSM elastification that preserves Mamba's structural constraints, heterogeneous MLP elastification, normalized MSE-based layer importance for improved depth selection, and knowledge distillation enabling simultaneous multi-budget optimization. We apply Nemotron Elastic to the Nemotron Nano V2 12B model, simultaneously producing a 9B and a 6B model using only 110B training tokens; this results in over 360x cost reduction compared to training model families from scratch, and around 7x compared to SoTA compression techniques. Each of the nested models performs on par or better than the SoTA in accuracy. Moreover, unlike other compression methods, the nested capability of our approach allows having a many-in-one reasoning model that has constant deployment memory against the number of models in the family.</p></details> |  |

We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 4 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |

Popular sampling methods like top-p (nucleus sampling) often struggle to balance quality and diversity, especially at higher temperatures which lead to incoherent or repetitive outputs. We propose min-p sampling, a dynamic truncation method that adjusts the sampling threshold based on the model's confidence by using the top token's probability as a scaling factor. Our experiments on benchmarks including GPQA, GSM8K, and AlpacaEval Creative Writing show that min-p sampling improves both the quality and diversity of generated text across different model families (Mistral and Llama 3) and model sizes (1B to 123B parameters), especially at higher temperatures. Human evaluations further show a clear preference for min-p sampling, in both text quality and creativity. Min-p sampling has been adopted by popular open-source LLM frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers, VLLM, and many others, highlighting its considerable impact on improving text generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral presentation at ICLR 2025.

Current automated agent design approaches are often constrained by limited search spaces that primarily optimize workflows but fail to integrate crucial human-designed components like memory, planning, and tool use. Furthermore, these methods are hampered by high evaluation costs, as evaluating even a single new agent on a benchmark can require tens of dollars. The difficulty of this exploration is further exacerbated by inefficient search strategies that struggle to navigate the large design space effectively, making the discovery of novel agents a slow and resource-intensive process. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSwift, a novel framework for automated agent design. We formalize a hierarchical search space that jointly models agentic workflow and composable functional components. This structure moves beyond optimizing workflows alone by co-optimizing functional components, which enables the discovery of more complex and effective agent architectures. To make exploration within this expansive space feasible, we mitigate high evaluation costs by training a value model on a high-quality dataset, generated via a novel strategy combining combinatorial coverage and balanced Bayesian sampling for low-cost evaluation. Guiding the entire process is a hierarchical MCTS strategy, which is informed by uncertainty to efficiently navigate the search space. Evaluated across a comprehensive set of seven benchmarks spanning embodied, math, web, tool, and game domains, AgentSwift discovers agents that achieve an average performance gain of 8.34\% over both existing automated agent search methods and manually designed agents. Our framework serves as a launchpad for researchers to rapidly discover powerful agent architectures.</p></details> | AAAI-2026 |

However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we theoretically analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is generally more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 21.25\% compared with KIVI-KV8 quantization over various context lengths.

However, FL faces critical challenges related to communication overhead and local resource constraints, especially in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. The sheer size of these models exacerbates both memory and communication constraints, making efficient transmission and processing essential for practical deployment. NVIDIA FLARE, an open-source SDK for federated learning, addresses these challenges by introducing advanced communication capabilities. Building upon existing solutions for large object streaming, we enhance FL workflows for LLMs through two key techniques: message quantization and container/file streaming. Quantization reduces message size, while streaming enables efficient memory management, improving scalability and integration with existing workflows. These advancements significantly enhance the robustness and efficiency of FL with LLMs, ensuring better performance in real-world federated learning scenarios.</p></details> | FLLM 2025 |

| **[Adaptive Mesh-Quantization for Neural PDE Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18474v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical systems commonly exhibit spatially varying complexity, presenting a significant challenge for neural PDE solvers. While Graph Neural Networks can handle the irregular meshes required for complex geometries and boundary conditions, they still apply uniform computational effort across all nodes regardless of the underlying physics complexity. This leads to inefficient resource allocation where computationally simple regions receive the same treatment as complex phenomena. We address this challenge by introducing Adaptive Mesh Quantization: spatially adaptive quantization across mesh node, edge, and cluster features, dynamically adjusting the bit-width used by a quantized model. We propose an adaptive bit-width allocation strategy driven by a lightweight auxiliary model that identifies high-loss regions in the input mesh. This enables dynamic resource distribution in the main model, where regions of higher difficulty are allocated increased bit-width, optimizing computational resource utilization. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness by integrating it with two state-of-the-art models, MP-PDE and GraphViT, to evaluate performance across multiple tasks: 2D Darcy flow, large-scale unsteady fluid dynamics in 2D, steady-state Navier-Stokes simulations in 3D, and a 2D hyper-elasticity problem. Our framework demonstrates consistent Pareto improvements over uniformly quantized baselines, yielding up to 50% improvements in performance at the same cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learn from Global Correlations: Enhancing Evolutionary Algorithm via Spectral GNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17629v5)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) simulate natural selection but have two main limitations: (1) they rarely update individuals based on global correlations, limiting comprehensive learning; (2) they struggle with balancing exploration and exploitation, where excessive exploitation causes premature convergence, and excessive exploration slows down the search. Moreover, EAs often depend on manual parameter settings, which can disrupt the exploration-exploitation balance. To address these issues, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a novel EA framework. GNE represents the population as a graph, where nodes represent individuals, and edges capture their relationships, enabling global information usage. GNE utilizes spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) to decompose evolutionary signals into frequency components, applying a filtering function to fuse these components. High-frequency components capture diverse global information, while low-frequency ones capture more consistent information. This explicit frequency filtering strategy directly controls global-scale features through frequency components, overcoming the limitations of manual parameter settings and making the exploration-exploitation control more interpretable and manageable. Tests on nine benchmark functions (e.g., Sphere, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock) show that GNE outperforms classical (GA, DE, CMA-ES) and advanced algorithms (SDAES, RL-SHADE) under various conditions, including noise-corrupted and optimal solution deviation scenarios. GNE achieves solutions several orders of magnitude better (e.g., 3.07e-20 mean on Sphere vs. 1.51e-07).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Equivariance is formulated as naturality in a topological category with Radon measures, formulating linear and nonlinear layers in the categorical setup. We prove the equivariant universal approximation theorem in the general setting: the class of finite-depth CENNs is dense in the space of continuous equivariant transformations. We instantiate the framework for groups/groupoids, posets/lattices, graphs and cellular sheaves, deriving universal approximation theorems for them in a systematic manner. Categorical equivariant deep learning thus allows us to expand the horizons of equivariant deep learning beyond group actions, encompassing not only geometric symmetries but also contextual and compositional symmetries.</p></details> |  |

However, existing studies remain limited in addressing two main challenges of multi-view molecular learning: (1) discovering shared information between two views while diminishing view-specific information and (2) identifying and aligning important substructures, e.g., functional groups, which are crucial for enhancing cross-view consistency and model expressiveness. To solve these challenges, we propose a Multi-View Conditional Information Bottleneck framework, called MVCIB, for pre-training graph neural networks on 2D and 3D molecular structures in a self-supervised setting. Our idea is to discover the shared information while minimizing irrelevant features from each view under the MVCIB principle, which uses one view as a contextual condition to guide the representation learning of its counterpart. To enhance semantic and structural consistency across views, we utilize key substructures, e.g., functional groups and ego-networks, as anchors between the two views. Then, we propose a cross-attention mechanism that captures fine-grained correlations between the substructures to achieve subgraph alignment across views. Extensive experiments in four molecular domains demonstrated that MVCIB consistently outperforms baselines in both predictive performance and interpretability. Moreover, MVCIB achieved the 3d Weisfeiler-Lehman expressiveness power to distinguish not only non-isomorphic graphs but also different 3D geometries that share identical 2D connectivity, such as isomers.</p></details> |  |

This topic is challenged since air pollution varies in a spatiotemporal manner and depends on many complicated factors. Our previous research has solved the problem by considering the whole city as an image and leveraged a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model to learn the spatiotemporal features. However, an image-based representation may not be ideal as air pollution and other impact factors have natural graph structures. In this research, we argue that a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) can efficiently represent the spatial features of air quality readings in the whole city. Specially, we extend the ConvLSTM model to a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (Spatiotemporal GCRNN) model by tightly integrating a GCN architecture into an RNN structure for efficient learning spatiotemporal characteristics of air quality values and their influential factors. Our extensive experiments prove the proposed model has a better performance compare to the state-of-the-art ConvLSTM model for air pollution predicting while the number of parameters is much smaller. Moreover, our approach is also superior to a hybrid GCN-based method in a real-world air pollution dataset.</p></details> | Updated metadata |

We present Brain-MGF, a multimodal graph fusion network for joint EEG-fMRI connectivity analysis. For each modality, we construct graphs with partial-correlation edges and Pearson-profile node features, and learn subject-level embeddings via graph convolution. An adaptive softmax gate then fuses modalities with sample-specific weights to capture context-dependent contributions. Using the world's largest single-site psilocybin dataset, PsiConnect, Brain-MGF distinguishes psilocybin from no-psilocybin conditions in meditation and rest. Fusion improves over unimodal and non-adaptive variants, achieving 74.0% accuracy and 76.5% F1 score on meditation, and 76.0% accuracy with 85.8% ROC-AUC on rest. UMAP visualisations reveal clearer class separation for fused embeddings. These results indicate that adaptive graph fusion effectively integrates complementary EEG-fMRI information, providing an interpretable framework for characterising psilocybin-induced alterations in large-scale neural organisation.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity as a potential solution to improve verification efficiency. However, there lacks a joint framework that considers all chip design domain knowledge, graph theory, and GPU kernel designs. To address this challenge, we introduce GROOT, an algorithm and system co-design framework that contains chip design domain knowledge and redesigned GPU kernels, to improve verification efficiency. More specifically, we create node features utilizing the circuit node types and the polarity of the connections between the input edges to nodes in And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs). We utilize a graph partitioning algorithm to divide the large graphs into smaller sub-graphs for fast GPU processing and develop a graph edge re-growth algorithm to recover verification accuracy. We carefully profile the EDA graph workloads and observe the uniqueness of their polarized distribution of high degree (HD) nodes and low degree (LD) nodes. We redesign two GPU kernels (HD-kernel and LD-kernel), to fit the EDA graph learning workload on a single GPU. We compare the results with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods: GAMORA, a GNN-based approach, and the traditional ABC framework. Results show that GROOT achieves a significant reduction in memory footprint (59.38 %), with high accuracy (99.96%) for a very large CSA multiplier, i.e. 1,024 bits with a batch size of 16, which consists of 134,103,040 nodes and 268,140,544 edges. We compare GROOT with GPU-based GPU Kernel designs SOTAs such as cuSPARSE, MergePath-SpMM, and GNNAdvisor. We achieve up to 1.104x, 5.796x, and 1.469x improvement in runtime, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Traditional graph neural network algorithms often fail because they learn spurious environmental correlations instead of stable causal relationships, leading to substantial performance degradation under distribution shifts. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue due to their vast world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, effectively integrating this knowledge with the fine-grained topology of specific graphs to solve the OOD problem remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose {$\textbf{Inv}$ariant $\textbf{G}$raph $\textbf{C}$ontrastive Learning with $\textbf{LLM}$s for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation (InvGCLLM)}, an innovative causal learning framework that synergistically integrates the strengths of data-driven models and knowledge-driven LLMs. Our framework first employs a data-driven invariant learning model to generate causal confidence scores for each user-item interaction. These scores then guide an LLM to perform targeted graph refinement, leveraging its world knowledge to prune spurious connections and augment missing causal links. Finally, the structurally purified graphs provide robust supervision for a causality-guided contrastive learning objective, enabling the model to learn representations that are resilient to spurious correlations. Experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that InvGCLLM achieves significant improvements in out-of-distribution recommendation, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Exact computation of this parameter is NP-hard, restricting classical methods to small instances. We compare two neural paradigms: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which operate on adjacency matrix representations, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which learn directly from graph structure through message passing. Across 2,000 random graphs with up to 64 vertices, GNNs achieve markedly higher accuracy ($R^2=0.987$, MAE $=0.372$) than CNNs ($R^2=0.955$, MAE $=0.500$). Both models offer substantial speedups over exact solvers, with GNNs delivering more than $200\times$ acceleration while retaining near-perfect fidelity. Our results position GNNs as a practical surrogate for combinatorial graph invariants, with implications for scalable graph optimization and mathematical discovery.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GNNs exhibit poor generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution perspective.</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |

While it greatly improves the generalization of graph neural networks, its privacy risks under membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a specific instance was used in training (member), remain largely unexplored. However, effectively conducting MIAs against multi-domain graph pre-trained models is a significant challenge due to: (i) Enhanced Generalization Capability: Multi-domain pre-training reduces the overfitting characteristics commonly exploited by MIAs. (ii) Unrepresentative Shadow Datasets: Diverse training graphs hinder the obtaining of reliable shadow graphs. (iii) Weakened Membership Signals: Embedding-based outputs offer less informative cues than logits for MIAs. To tackle these challenges, we propose MGP-MIA, a novel framework for Membership Inference Attacks against Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained models. Specifically, we first propose a membership signal amplification mechanism that amplifies the overfitting characteristics of target models via machine unlearning. We then design an incremental shadow model construction mechanism that builds a reliable shadow model with limited shadow graphs via incremental learning. Finally, we introduce a similarity-based inference mechanism that identifies members based on their similarity to positive and negative samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MGP-MIA and reveal the privacy risks of multi-domain graph pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026(Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Neural Graph Navigation for Intelligent Subgraph Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17939v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph matching, a cornerstone of relational pattern detection in domains ranging from biochemical systems to social network analysis, faces significant computational challenges due to the dramatically growing search space. Existing methods address this problem within a filtering-ordering-enumeration framework, in which the enumeration stage recursively matches the query graph against the candidate subgraphs of the data graph. However, the lack of awareness of subgraph structural patterns leads to a costly brute-force enumeration, thereby critically motivating the need for intelligent navigation in subgraph matching. To address this challenge, we propose Neural Graph Navigation (NeuGN), a neuro-heuristic framework that transforms brute-force enumeration into neural-guided search by integrating neural navigation mechanisms into the core enumeration process. By preserving heuristic-based completeness guarantees while incorporating neural intelligence, NeuGN significantly reduces the \textit{First Match Steps} by up to 98.2\% compared to state-of-the-art methods across six real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, accurate modeling of realistic grain boundary networks requires large simulation cells, which GNN has difficulty scaling up to. To alleviate the computational costs and memory footprint of GNN, we propose a hybrid architecture combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) based bijective autoencoder to compress the spatial dimensions, and a GNN that evolves the microstructure in the latent space of reduced spatial sizes. Our results demonstrate that the new design significantly reduces computational costs with using fewer message passing layer (from 12 down to 3) compared with GNN alone. The reduction in computational cost becomes more pronounced as the spatial size increases, indicating strong computational scalability. For the largest mesh evaluated (160^3), our method reduces memory usage and runtime in inference by 117x and 115x, respectively, compared with GNN-only baseline. More importantly, it shows higher accuracy and stronger spatiotemporal capability than the GNN-only baseline, especially in long-term testing. Such combination of scalability and accuracy is essential for simulating realistic material microstructures over extended time scales. The improvements can be attributed to the bijective autoencoder's ability to compress information losslessly from spatial domain into a high dimensional feature space, thereby producing more expressive latent features for the GNN to learn from, while also contributing its own spatiotemporal modeling capability. The training was optimized to learn from the stochastic Potts Monte Carlo method. Our findings provide a highly scalable approach for simulating grain growth.</p></details> |  |

These models are trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also present experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of larger warehouses operation datasets as the models are scaled up.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Ternary Gamma Semirings as a Novel Algebraic Framework for Learnable Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17728v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary semirings such as the tropical, log, and probability semirings form a core algebraic tool in classical and modern neural inference systems, supporting tasks like Viterbi decoding, dynamic programming, and probabilistic reasoning. However, these structures rely on a binary multiplication operator and therefore model only pairwise interactions. Many symbolic AI tasks are inherently triadic, including subject-predicate-object relations in knowledge graphs, logical rules involving two premises and one conclusion, and multi-entity dependencies in structured decision processes. Existing neural architectures usually approximate these interactions by flattening or factorizing them into binary components, which weakens inductive structure, distorts relational meaning, and reduces interpretability. This paper introduces the Neural Ternary Semiring (NTS), a learnable and differentiable algebraic framework grounded in the theory of ternary Gamma-semirings. The central idea is to replace the usual binary product with a native ternary operator implemented by neural networks and guided by algebraic regularizers enforcing approximate associativity and distributivity. This construction allows triadic relationships to be represented directly rather than reconstructed from binary interactions. We establish a soundness result showing that, when algebraic violations vanish during training, the learned operator converges to a valid ternary Gamma-semiring. We also outline an evaluation strategy for triadic reasoning tasks such as knowledge-graph completion and rule-based inference. These insights demonstrate that ternary Gamma-semirings provide a mathematically principled and practically effective foundation for learnable symbolic reasoning.</p></details> |  |

While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies. After reinforcement learning, our policy achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world graph structures and consistently outperforms the policy directly trained on the test graphs by the existing game RL approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the Curse of Knowledge: Towards Effective Multimodal Recommendation using Knowledge Soft Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07419v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical challenge in contemporary recommendation systems lies in effectively leveraging multimodal content to enhance recommendation personalization. Although various solutions have been proposed, most fail to account for discrepancies between knowledge extracted through isolated feature extraction and its application in recommendation tasks. Specifically, multimodal feature extraction does not incorporate task-specific prior knowledge, while downstream recommendation tasks typically use these features as auxiliary information. This misalignment often introduces biases in model fitting and degrades performance, a phenomenon we refer to as the curse of knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose a knowledge soft integration framework designed to balance the utilization of multimodal features with the biases they may introduce. The framework, named Knowledge Soft Integration (KSI), comprises two key components: the Structure Efficient Injection (SEI) module and the Semantic Soft Integration (SSI) module. The SEI module employs a Refined Graph Neural Network (RGNN) to model inter-modal correlations among items while introducing a regularization term to minimize redundancy in user and item representations. In parallel, the SSI module utilizes a self-supervised retrieval task to implicitly integrate multimodal semantic knowledge, thereby enhancing the semantic distinctiveness of item representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating KSI's effectiveness. Furthermore, these results underscore the ability of the SEI and SSI modules to reduce representation redundancy and mitigate the curse of knowledge in multimodal recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |

They are finding an increasing range of applications; however, as with other modern machine learning techniques, their theoretical understanding is limited. GNNs can encounter difficulties in gathering information from nodes that are far apart by iterated aggregation steps. This situation is partly caused by so-called oversmoothing; and overcoming it is one of the practically motivated challenges. We consider the situation where information is aggregated by multiple steps of convolution, leading to graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We analyze the generalization performance of a basic GCN, trained for node classification on data generated by the contextual stochastic block model. We predict its asymptotic performance by deriving the free energy of the problem, using the replica method, in the high-dimensional limit. Calling depth the number of convolutional steps, we show the importance of going to large depth to approach the Bayes-optimality. We detail how the architecture of the GCN has to scale with the depth to avoid oversmoothing. The resulting large depth limit can be close to the Bayes-optimality and leads to a continuous GCN. Technically, we tackle this continuous limit via an approach that resembles dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with constraints at the initial and final times. An expansion around large regularization allows us to solve the corresponding equations for the performance of the deep GCN. This promising tool may contribute to the analysis of further deep neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive Query Answering on Knowledge Graphs with Soft Entity Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13663v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve entities that are \emph{likely} to be answers, which is particularly useful when such answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges. However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem of query answering with soft constraints. We formalize the problem and introduce two efficient methods designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints without disrupting the original answers to a query. These methods are lightweight, requiring tuning only two parameters or a small neural network trained to capture soft constraints while maintaining the original ranking structure. To evaluate the task, we extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that our methods can capture soft constraints while maintaining robust query answering performance and adding very little overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396v4)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[How LLMs Learn to Reason: A Complex Network Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23629v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, a V-shaped response-length trajectory, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these behaviors are emergent collective phenomena governed not by neural implementation details, but by the topological evolution of the latent reasoning graph in semantic space. By demonstrating a dynamical isomorphism between a 1.5B-parameter LLM and a minimal Concept Network Model (CoNet), we trace the causal source to the self-organization of a sparse concept web pinned to an average degree of two. This geometric perspective provides a unified physical explanation for the observed anomalies: the V-shaped trajectory tracks the evolution from parallel local skill optimization to global network integration; catastrophic forgetting stems from the topological disconnection of critical ``trunk'' edges; and policy collapse arises from the accumulation of sequential transitions at the web's leaf nodes, where broad exploration abruptly freezes into rigid, high-reward trajectories. Identifying a ``maximally frustrated state'' at the transition between learning stages, we propose Annealed-RLVR, a principled algorithm that injects a targeted SFT ``heating'' step to resolve this topological bottleneck. Experiments confirm that this theory-driven intervention outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks (including Minerva and AIME). By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, 1 table, under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Existing approaches extend this range through continuous-time dynamics or dense self-attention, but both suffer from high computational cost and limited scalability. We propose Topologic Attention Networks, a new framework that applies topologic attention, a probabilistic mechanism that learns how information should flow through both direct and indirect connections in a graph. Unlike conventional attention that depends on explicit pairwise interactions, topologic attention emerges from the learned information propagation of the graph, enabling unified reasoning over local and global relationships. This method achieves provides state-of-the-art performance across all measured baseline models.

However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that GCL-OT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[When Structure Doesn't Help: LLMs Do Not Read Text-Attributed Graphs as Effectively as We Expected](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16767v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs provide a unified representation of semantic content and relational structure, making them a natural fit for domains such as molecular modeling, citation networks, and social graphs. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era. Our study is to systematically challenge the foundational assumption that structure is inherently beneficial for LLM-based graph reasoning, opening the door to new, semantics-driven approaches for graph learning.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Dialogue Diplomats, a novel end-to-end multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed for automated conflict resolution and consensus building in complex, dynamic environments. The proposed system integrates advanced deep reinforcement learning architectures with dialogue-based negotiation protocols, enabling autonomous agents to engage in sophisticated conflict resolution through iterative communication and strategic adaptation. We present three primary contributions: first, a novel Hierarchical Consensus Network (HCN) architecture that combines attention mechanisms with graph neural networks to model inter-agent dependencies and conflict dynamics. second, a Progressive Negotiation Protocol (PNP) that structures multi-round dialogue interactions with adaptive concession strategies; and third, a Context-Aware Reward Shaping mechanism that balances individual agent objectives with collective consensus goals.</p></details> |  |

Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Surgical Scene Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16430v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses. Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks. Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures. Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Although heuristic-based backtracking and SAT solvers can address these challenges, they often struggle to simultaneously handle both complex constraints and secondary objectives. In this study, we present a hybrid workflow that casts multipatterning as a variant of a constrained graph coloring problem with the primary objective of minimizing feature violations and a secondary objective of balancing the number of features on each mask. Our pipeline integrates two main components: (1) A GNN-based agent, trained in an unsupervised manner to generate initial color predictions, which are refined by (2) refinement strategies (a GNN-based heuristic and simulated annealing) that together enhance solution quality and balance. Experimental evaluation in both proprietary data sets and publicly available open source layouts demonstrate complete conflict-free decomposition and consistent color balancing.

For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets.

This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework recipe for weed detection that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build robustness to multiple field conditions. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data. Experimental results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The proposed model architecture enables local, global, and relational feature representations and offers high interpretability and adaptability.

Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively.

| **[HybSpecNet: A Critical Analysis of Architectural Instability in Hybrid-Domain Spectral GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16101v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral Graph Neural Networks offer a principled approach to graph filtering but face a fundamental "Stability-vs-Adaptivity" trade-off. This trade-off is dictated by the choice of spectral domain. Filters in the finite [-1, 1] domain (e.g., ChebyNet) are numerically stable at high polynomial degrees (K) but are static and low-pass, causing them to fail on heterophilic graphs. Conversely, filters in the semi-infinite [0, infty) domain (e.g., KrawtchoukNet) are highly adaptive and achieve SOTA results on heterophily by learning non-low-pass responses. However, as we demonstrate, these adaptive filters can also suffer from numerical instability, leading to catastrophic performance collapse at high K. In this paper, we propose to resolve this trade-off by designing a hybrid-domain GNN, HybSpecNet, which combines a stable `ChebyNet` branch with an adaptive `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We first demonstrate that a "naive" hybrid architecture, which fuses the branches via concatenation, successfully unifies performance at low K, achieving strong results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks. However, we then prove that this naive architecture fails the stability test. Our K-ablation experiments show that this architecture catastrophically collapses at K=25, exactly mirroring the collapse of its unstable `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We identify this critical finding as "Instability Poisoning," where `NaN`/`Inf` gradients from the adaptive branch destroy the training of the model. Finally, we propose and validate an advanced architecture that uses "Late Fusion" to completely isolate the gradient pathways. We demonstrate that this successfully solves the instability problem, remaining perfectly stable up to K=30 while retaining its SOTA performance across all graph types. This work identifies a critical architectural pitfall in hybrid GNN design and provides the robust architectural solution.</p></details> |  |

We propose a Gauge-Equivariant Graph Network with Self-Interference Cancellation (GESC), which replaces additive aggregation with a projection-based interference mechanism. Unlike prior magnetic or gauge-equivariant GNNs that typically focus on phase handling in spectral filtering while largely relying on scalar weighting, GESC introduces a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ phase connection followed by a rank-1 projection that attenuates self-parallel components before attention. A sign- and phase-aware gate further regulates neighbor influence, attenuating components aligned with current node states and acting as a local notch on low-frequency modes. Across diverse graph benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art models while offering a unified, interference-aware view of message passing.

| **[Exploiting Inter-Sample Information for Long-tailed Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16015v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is essential for safe deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods. Experiments over three benchmarks CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of FPR and tail-class ID classification accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Traditional manual inspection methods provide limited coverage and delayed response, often missing critical anomalies. This paper proposes AquaSentinel, a novel physics-informed AI system for real-time anomaly detection in urban underground water pipeline networks. We introduce four key innovations: (1) strategic sparse sensor deployment at high-centrality nodes combined with physics-based state augmentation to achieve network-wide observability from minimal infrastructure; (2) the RTCA (Real-Time Cumulative Anomaly) detection algorithm, which employs dual-threshold monitoring with adaptive statistics to distinguish transient fluctuations from genuine anomalies; (3) a Mixture of Experts (MoE) ensemble of spatiotemporal graph neural networks that provides robust predictions by dynamically weighting model contributions; (4) causal flow-based leak localization that traces anomalies upstream to identify source nodes and affected pipe segments. Our system strategically deploys sensors at critical network junctions and leverages physics-based modeling to propagate measurements to unmonitored nodes, creating virtual sensors that enhance data availability across the entire network. Experimental evaluation using 110 leak scenarios demonstrates that AquaSentinel achieves 100% detection accuracy. This work advances pipeline monitoring by demonstrating that physics-informed sparse sensing can match the performance of dense deployments at a fraction of the cost, providing a practical solution for aging urban infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables, Accepted to the 40th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026), IAAI Deployed Applications Track</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Environmental Claim Detection with Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13628v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer based models, especially large language models (LLMs) dominate the field of NLP with their mass adoption in tasks such as text generation, summarization and fake news detection. These models offer ease of deployment and reliability for most applications, however, they require significant amounts of computational power for training as well as inference. This poses challenges in their adoption in resource-constrained applications, especially in the open-source community where compute availability is usually scarce. This work proposes a graph-based approach for Environmental Claim Detection, exploring Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) as lightweight yet effective alternatives to transformer-based models. Re-framing the task as a graph classification problem, we transform claim sentences into dependency parsing graphs, utilizing a combination of word2vec \& learnable part-of-speech (POS) tag embeddings for the node features and encoding syntactic dependencies in the edge relations. Our results show that our graph-based models, particularly HGNNs in the poincaré space (P-HGNNs), achieve performance superior to the state-of-the-art on environmental claim detection while using up to \textbf{30x fewer parameters}. We also demonstrate that HGNNs benefit vastly from explicitly modeling data in hierarchical (tree-like) structures, enabling them to significantly improve over their euclidean counterparts.</p></details> |  |

However, many real-world systems -- such as biological or social networks -- feature multi-way interactions that GNNs fail to capture. Topological Deep Learning (TDL) addresses this by modeling and leveraging higher-order structures, with Combinatorial Complex Neural Networks (CCNNs) offering a general and expressive approach that has been shown to outperform GNNs. However, TDL lacks the principled and standardized frameworks that underpin GNN development, restricting its accessibility and applicability. To address this issue, we introduce Generalized CCNNs (GCCNs), a simple yet powerful family of TDL models that can be used to systematically transform any (graph) neural network into its TDL counterpart. We prove that GCCNs generalize and subsume CCNNs, while extensive experiments on a diverse class of GCCNs show that these architectures consistently match or outperform CCNNs, often with less model complexity. In an effort to accelerate and democratize TDL, we introduce TopoTune, a lightweight software for defining, building, and training GCCNs with unprecedented flexibility and ease.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Retinal Disease Prediction Using Biology-Informed Heterogeneous Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16697v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretability is crucial to enhance trust in machine learning models for medical diagnostics. However, most state-of-the-art image classifiers based on neural networks are not interpretable. As a result, clinicians often resort to known biomarkers for diagnosis, although biomarker-based classification typically performs worse than large neural networks. This work proposes a method that surpasses the performance of established machine learning models while simultaneously improving prediction interpretability for diabetic retinopathy staging from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images. Our method is based on a novel biology-informed heterogeneous graph representation that models retinal vessel segments, intercapillary areas, and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in a human-interpretable way. This graph representation allows us to frame diabetic retinopathy staging as a graph-level classification task, which we solve using an efficient graph neural network. We benchmark our method against well-established baselines, including classical biomarker-based classifiers, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and vision transformers. Our model outperforms all baselines on two datasets. Crucially, we use our biology-informed graph to provide explanations of unprecedented detail. Our approach surpasses existing methods in precisely localizing and identifying critical vessels or intercapillary areas. In addition, we give informative and human-interpretable attributions to critical characteristics. Our work contributes to the development of clinical decision-support tools in ophthalmology.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework recipe for weed detection that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build robustness to multiple field conditions. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data. Experimental results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The proposed model architecture enables local, global, and relational feature representations and offers high interpretability and adaptability. Practically, the framework allows real-time, efficient deployment to edge devices for automated weed detecting, reducing over-reliance on herbicides and providing scalable, sustainable precision-farming options.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computation for Epidemic Prediction with Graph Neural Network by Model Combination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15469v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modelling epidemic events such as COVID-19 cases in both time and space dimensions is an important but challenging task. Building on in-depth review and assessment of two popular graph neural network (GNN)-based regional epidemic forecasting models of \textbf{EpiGNN} and \textbf{ColaGNN}, we propose a novel hybrid graph neural network model, \textbf{EpiHybridGNN}, which integrates the strengths of both EpiGNN and \textbf{ColaGNN}. In the EpiGNN, through its transmission risk encoding module and Region-Aware Graph Learner (RAGL), both multi-scale convolutions and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are combined, aiming to effectively capture spatio-temporal propagation dynamics between regions and support the integration of external resources to enhance forecasting performance. While, in the ColaGNN, a cross-location attention mechanism, multi-scale dilated convolutions, and graph message passing are utilized to address the challenges of long-term forecasting through dynamic graph structures and spatio-temporal feature fusion. Both enjoy respective advantages but also share mutual shortcomings. Our EpiHybridGNN is therefore designed to combine the advantages of both EpiGNN, in its risk encoding and RAGL, and ColaGNN, in its long-term forecasting capabilities and dynamic attention mechanisms. This helps to form a more comprehensive and robust prediction of spatio-temporal epidemic propagation. The computational architecture, core formulas and their interpretations of our proposed EpiHybridGNN are provided. Multiple numerical real data experiments validate that our EpiHybridGNN significantly outperforms both EpiGNN and ColaGNN in epidemic forecasting with comprehensive insights and references offered.</p></details> | 37pages, 24 figures |
| **[S-DAG: A Subject-Based Directed Acyclic Graph for Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06727v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in complex reasoning problems. Their effectiveness highly depends on the specific nature of the task, especially the required domain knowledge. Existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts, typically operate at the task level; they are too coarse to effectively solve the heterogeneous problems involving multiple subjects. This work proposes a novel framework that performs fine-grained analysis at subject level equipped with a designated multi-agent collaboration strategy for addressing heterogeneous problem reasoning. Specifically, given an input query, we first employ a Graph Neural Network to identify the relevant subjects and infer their interdependencies to generate an \textit{Subject-based Directed Acyclic Graph} (S-DAG), where nodes represent subjects and edges encode information flow. Then we profile the LLM models by assigning each model a subject-specific expertise score, and select the top-performing one for matching corresponding subject of the S-DAG. Such subject-model matching enables graph-structured multi-agent collaboration where information flows from the starting model to the ending model over S-DAG. We curate and release multi-subject subsets of standard benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, MedMCQA) to better reflect complex, real-world reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing task-level model selection and multi-agent collaboration baselines in accuracy and efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of subject-aware reasoning and structured collaboration in addressing complex and multi-subject problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

This paper investigates a novel platform-agnostic reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph neural network-based policy for next-waypoint selection, with a safety filter ensuring safe mobility. Specifically, the neural network is trained using reinforcement learning through the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to maximize exploration efficiency while minimizing safety filter interventions. Henceforth, when the policy proposes an infeasible action, the safety filter overrides it with the closest feasible alternative, ensuring consistent system behavior. In addition, this paper introduces a reward function shaped by a potential field that accounts for both the agent's proximity to unexplored regions and the expected information gain from reaching them. The proposed framework combines the adaptability of reinforcement learning-based exploration policies with the reliability provided by explicit safety mechanisms. This feature plays a key role in enabling the deployment of learning-based policies on robotic platforms operating in real-world environments. Extensive evaluations in both simulations and experiments performed in a lab environment demonstrate that the approach achieves efficient and safe exploration in cluttered spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation</p></details> |
| **[LaguerreNet: Advancing a Unified Solution for Heterophily and Over-smoothing with Adaptive Continuous Polynomials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15328v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from two critical limitations: poor performance on "heterophilic" graphs and performance collapse at high polynomial degrees (K), known as over-smoothing. Both issues stem from the static, low-pass nature of standard filters (e.g., ChebyNet). While adaptive polynomial filters, such as the discrete MeixnerNet, have emerged as a potential unified solution, their extension to the continuous domain and stability with unbounded coefficients remain open questions. In this work, we propose `LaguerreNet`, a novel GNN filter based on continuous Laguerre polynomials. `LaguerreNet` learns the filter's spectral shape by making its core alpha parameter trainable, thereby advancing the adaptive polynomial approach. We solve the severe O(k^2) numerical instability of these unbounded polynomials using a `LayerNorm`-based stabilization technique. We demonstrate experimentally that this approach is highly effective: 1) `LaguerreNet` achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging heterophilic benchmarks. 2) It is exceptionally robust to over-smoothing, with performance peaking at K=10, an order of magnitude beyond where ChebyNet collapses.</p></details> |  |

Both issues stem from the static, low-pass nature of standard filters. In this work, we propose `KrawtchoukNet`, a GNN filter based on the discrete Krawtchouk polynomials. We demonstrate that `KrawtchoukNet` provides a unified solution to both problems through two key design choices. First, by fixing the polynomial's domain N to a small constant (e.g., N=20), we create the first GNN filter whose recurrence coefficients are \textit{inherently bounded}, making it exceptionally robust to over-smoothing (achieving SOTA results at K=10). Second, by making the filter's shape parameter p learnable, the filter adapts its spectral response to the graph data. We show this adaptive nature allows `KrawtchoukNet` to achieve SOTA performance on challenging heterophilic benchmarks (Texas, Cornell), decisively outperforming standard GNNs like GAT and APPNP.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address key limitations in state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods for reassembly, namely i) scalability; ii) multimodality; and iii) real-world applicability: beyond square or simple geometric shapes, realistic and complex erosion, or other real-world problems. We propose ReassembleNet, a method that reduces complexity by representing each input piece as a set of contour keypoints and learning to select the most informative ones by Graph Neural Networks pooling inspired techniques. ReassembleNet effectively lowers computational complexity while enabling the integration of features from multiple modalities, including both geometric and texture data. Further enhanced through pretraining on a semi-synthetic dataset. We then apply diffusion-based pose estimation to recover the original structure. We improve on prior methods by 57% and 87% for RMSE Rotation and Translation, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Edge-Centric Relational Reasoning for 3D Scene Graph Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15288v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene graph prediction aims to abstract complex 3D environments into structured graphs consisting of objects and their pairwise relationships. Existing approaches typically adopt object-centric graph neural networks, where relation edge features are iteratively updated by aggregating messages from connected object nodes. However, this design inherently restricts relation representations to pairwise object context, making it difficult to capture high-order relational dependencies that are essential for accurate relation prediction. To address this limitation, we propose a Link-guided Edge-centric relational reasoning framework with Object-aware fusion, namely LEO, which enables progressive reasoning from relation-level context to object-level understanding. Specifically, LEO first predicts potential links between object pairs to suppress irrelevant edges, and then transforms the original scene graph into a line graph where each relation is treated as a node. A line graph neural network is applied to perform edge-centric relational reasoning to capture inter-relation context. The enriched relation features are subsequently integrated into the original object-centric graph to enhance object-level reasoning and improve relation prediction. Our framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any existing object-centric method. Experiments on the 3DSSG dataset with two competitive baselines show consistent improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of our edge-to-object reasoning paradigm.</p></details> |  |

Knowledge distillation, transfer learning, and dataset distillation have made such transfers more efficient, yet they remain fundamentally data-driven: a teacher must produce examples, logits, or gradients for a student to learn. In this work, we introduce Model-to-Model Knowledge Transmission (M2KT), a novel paradigm for data-free conceptual transfer between neural networks. M2KT enables models to exchange knowledge packets that encapsulate structured concept embeddings, abstraction graphs, reasoning traces, and provenance metadata. Unlike classical distillation, M2KT operates primarily in concept space rather than example space, and it does not require labeled datasets or teacher-generated outputs during transfer. We formalize the notion of concept manifolds, introduce an inter-model alignment mapping between teacher and student latent spaces, and derive a composite loss that enforces geometric, structural, and reasoning consistency together with explicit safety constraints. We further present algorithmic procedures for teacher-side packet generation and student-side ingestion and verification. Experiments on symbolic reasoning with large language models show that M2KT can achieve approximately 85 to 90 percent of teacher performance while reducing data usage by over 98 percent compared to standard knowledge distillation. This work establishes a theoretical and practical foundation for data-free AI-to-AI knowledge transfer and self-improving model ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages including figures, prepared in IEEE conference style.

We introduce FireCastNet, a novel deep learning architecture that combines 3D convolutional encoding with GraphCast-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model complex spatio-temporal dependencies for global wildfire prediction. Our approach leverages the SeasFire dataset, a comprehensive multivariate Earth system datacube containing climate, vegetation, and human-related variables, to forecast burned area patterns up to six months in advance. FireCastNet treats the Earth as an interconnected graph, enabling it to capture both local fire dynamics and long-range teleconnections that influence wildfire behavior across different spatial and temporal scales. Through comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art models including GRU, Conv-GRU, Conv-LSTM, U-TAE, and TeleViT, we demonstrate that FireCastNet achieves superior performance in global burned area forecasting, with particularly strong results in fire-prone regions such as Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. Our analysis reveals that longer input time-series significantly improve prediction robustness, while spatial context integration enhances model performance across extended forecasting horizons. Additionally, we implement local area modeling techniques that provide enhanced spatial resolution and accuracy for region-specific predictions. These findings highlight the importance of modeling Earth system interactions for long-term wildfire prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Physics Still Matters: Improving Machine Learning Prediction of Material Properties with Phonon-Informed Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15222v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) methods have become powerful tools for predicting material properties with near first-principles accuracy and vastly reduced computational cost. However, the performance of ML models critically depends on the quality, size, and diversity of the training dataset. In materials science, this dependence is particularly important for learning from low-symmetry atomistic configurations that capture thermal excitations, structural defects, and chemical disorder, features that are ubiquitous in real materials but underrepresented in most datasets. The absence of systematic strategies for generating representative training data may therefore limit the predictive power of ML models in technologically critical fields such as energy conversion and photonics. In this work, we assess the effectiveness of graph neural network (GNN) models trained on two fundamentally different types of datasets: one composed of randomly generated atomic configurations and another constructed using physically informed sampling based on lattice vibrations. As a case study, we address the challenging task of predicting electronic and mechanical properties of a prototypical family of optoelectronic materials under realistic finite-temperature conditions. We find that the phonons-informed model consistently outperforms the randomly trained counterpart, despite relying on fewer data points. Explainability analyses further reveal that high-performing models assign greater weight to chemically meaningful bonds that control property variations, underscoring the importance of physically guided data generation. Overall, this work demonstrates that larger datasets do not necessarily yield better GNN predictive models and introduces a simple and general strategy for efficiently constructing high-quality training data in materials informatics.</p></details> | 12 pages; 5 figures |
| **[Combining LLM Semantic Reasoning with GNN Structural Modeling for Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08008v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view multi-label feature selection aims to identify informative features from heterogeneous views, where each sample is associated with multiple interdependent labels. This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown promise, yet classical models rely on large multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that are parameter-heavy and memory-bound. We propose a Quantum Graph Attention Network (Q-GAT) within a DRL framework, where parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) replace conventional MLPs at critical readout stages. The hybrid model maintains the expressive capacity of graph attention encoders while reducing trainable parameters by more than 50%. Using proximal policy optimization (PPO) with greedy and stochastic decoding, experiments on VRP benchmarks show that Q-GAT achieves faster convergence and reduces routing cost by about 5% compared with classical GAT baselines. These results demonstrate the potential of PQC-enhanced GNNs as compact and effective solvers for large-scale routing and logistics optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.

The reliance on high-energy-consuming continuous floating-point operations inherent in GCN-based methods poses significant challenges for deployment in energy-constrained, battery-powered edge devices. To address these limitations, MK-SGN, a Spiking Graph Convolutional Network with Multimodal Fusion and Knowledge Distillation, is proposed to leverage the energy efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for skeleton-based action recognition for the first time. By integrating the energy-saving properties of SNNs with the graph representation capabilities of GCNs, MK-SGN achieves significant reductions in energy consumption while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy. Firstly, we formulate a Spiking Multimodal Fusion (SMF) module to effectively fuse multimodal skeleton data represented as spike-form features. Secondly, we propose the Self-Attention Spiking Graph Convolution (SA-SGC) module and the Spiking Temporal Convolution (STC) module, to capture spatial relationships and temporal dynamics of spike-form features. Finally, we propose an integrated knowledge distillation strategy to transfer information from the multimodal GCN to the SGN, incorporating both intermediate-layer distillation and soft-label distillation to enhance the performance of the SGN. MK-SGN exhibits substantial advantages, surpassing state-of-the-art GCN frameworks in energy efficiency and outperforming state-of-the-art SNN frameworks in recognition accuracy. The proposed method achieves a remarkable reduction in energy consumption, exceeding 98\% compared to conventional GCN-based approaches. This research establishes a robust baseline for developing high-performance, energy-efficient SNN-based models for skeleton-based action recognition</p></details> |  |
| **[Resource-Based Time and Cost Prediction in Project Networks: From Statistical Modeling to Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15003v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of project duration and cost remains one of the most challenging aspects of project management, particularly in resource-constrained and interdependent task networks. Traditional analytical techniques such as the Critical Path Method (CPM) and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) rely on simplified and often static assumptions regarding task interdependencies and resource performance. This study proposes a novel resource-based predictive framework that integrates network representations of project activities with graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture structural and contextual relationships among tasks, resources, and time-cost dynamics. The model represents the project as a heterogeneous activity-resource graph in which nodes denote activities and resources, and edges encode temporal and resource dependencies. We evaluate multiple learning paradigms, including GraphSAGE and Temporal Graph Networks, on both synthetic and benchmark project datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN framework achieves an average 23 to 31 percent reduction in mean absolute error compared to traditional regression and tree-based methods, while improving the coefficient of determination R2 from approximately 0.78 to 0.91 for large and complex project networks. Furthermore, the learned embeddings provide interpretable insights into resource bottlenecks and critical dependencies, enabling more explainable and adaptive scheduling decisions.</p></details> | 52 pages, 12 figures |

We present Causal-GCN, an interventional graph convolutional framework that integrates do-calculus-based back-door adjustment to identify brain regions exerting stable causal influence on AD progression. Each subject's MRI is represented as a structural connectome where nodes denote cortical and subcortical regions and edges encode anatomical connectivity. Confounders such as age, sec, and APOE4 genotype are summarized via principal components and included in the causal adjustment set. After training, interventions on individual regions are simulated by serving their incoming edges and altering node features to estimate average causal effects on disease probability. Applied to 484 subjects from the ADNI cohort, Causal-GCN achieves performance comparable to baseline GNNs while providing interpretable causal effect rankings that highlight posterior, cingulate, and insular hubs consistent with established AD neuropathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoSceneGraph: Geometric Scene Graph Diffusion Model for Text-guided 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14884v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods that synthesize indoor 3D scenes from text prompts have wide-ranging applications in film production, interior design, video games, virtual reality, and synthetic data generation for training embodied agents. Existing approaches typically either train generative models from scratch or leverage vision-language models (VLMs). While VLMs achieve strong performance, particularly for complex or open-ended prompts, smaller task-specific models remain necessary for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as extended reality (XR) glasses or mobile phones. However, many generative approaches that train from scratch overlook the inherent graph structure of indoor scenes, which can limit scene coherence and realism. Conversely, methods that incorporate scene graphs either demand a user-provided semantic graph, which is generally inconvenient and restrictive, or rely on ground-truth relationship annotations, limiting their capacity to capture more varied object interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce GeoSceneGraph, a method that synthesizes 3D scenes from text prompts by leveraging the graph structure and geometric symmetries of 3D scenes, without relying on predefined relationship classes. Despite not using ground-truth relationships, GeoSceneGraph achieves performance comparable to methods that do. Our model is built on equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs), but existing EGNN approaches are typically limited to low-dimensional conditioning and are not designed to handle complex modalities such as text. We propose a simple and effective strategy for conditioning EGNNs on text features, and we validate our design through ablation studies.</p></details> |  |

For drug discovery specifically, a key inflection - akin to vision's "ImageNet moment" - arrived in 2015, when deep neural networks surpassed traditional approaches on the Tox21 Data Challenge. This milestone accelerated the adoption of deep learning across the pharmaceutical industry, and today most major companies have integrated these methods into their research pipelines. After the Tox21 Challenge concluded, its dataset was included in several established benchmarks, such as MoleculeNet and the Open Graph Benchmark. However, during these integrations, the dataset was altered and labels were imputed or manufactured, resulting in a loss of comparability across studies. Consequently, the extent to which bioactivity and toxicity prediction methods have improved over the past decade remains unclear. To this end, we introduce a reproducible leaderboard, hosted on Hugging Face with the original Tox21 Challenge dataset, together with a set of baseline and representative methods. The current version of the leaderboard indicates that the original Tox21 winner - the ensemble-based DeepTox method - and the descriptor-based self-normalizing neural networks introduced in 2017, continue to perform competitively and rank among the top methods for toxicity prediction, leaving it unclear whether substantial progress in toxicity prediction has been achieved over the past decade. As part of this work, we make all baselines and evaluated models publicly accessible for inference via standardized API calls to Hugging Face Spaces.</p></details> |  |

This survey presents the first comprehensive review dedicated specifically to the use of GNNs within Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs). By leveraging both Euclidean and non-Euclidean transportation-related data, including traffic patterns, road users, and weather conditions, GNNs offer promising solutions for analyzing and enhancing VSN applications. The survey systematically categorizes and analyzes existing studies according to major VSN-related tasks, including traffic flow and trajectory prediction, traffic forecasting, signal control, driving assistance, routing problem, and connectivity management. It further provides quantitative insights and synthesizes key takeaways derived from the literature review. Additionally, the survey examines the available datasets and outlines open research directions needed to advance GNN-based VSN applications. The findings indicate that, although GNNs demonstrate strong potential for improving the accuracy, robustness, and real-time performances of on task-specific or sub-VSN graphs, there remains a notable absence of studies that model a complete, standalone VSN encompassing all functional components. With the increasing availability of data and continued progress in graph learning, GNNs are expected to play a central role in enabling future large-scale and fully integrated VSN applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |

Although graph neural networks that leverage neuroimaging data have shown promise in depression diagnosis, existing approaches are predominantly data-driven and operate largely as black-box models, lacking neurobiological interpretability. Here, we present NH-GCAT (Neurocircuitry-Inspired Hierarchical Graph Causal Attention Networks), a novel framework that bridges neuroscience domain knowledge with deep learning by explicitly and hierarchically modeling depression-specific mechanisms at different spatial scales. Our approach introduces three key technical contributions: (1) at the local brain regional level, we design a residual gated fusion module that integrates temporal blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) dynamics with functional connectivity patterns, specifically engineered to capture local depression-relevant low-frequency neural oscillations; (2) at the multi-regional circuit level, we propose a hierarchical circuit encoding scheme that aggregates regional node representations following established depression neurocircuitry organization, and (3) at the multi-circuit network level, we develop a variational latent causal attention mechanism that leverages a continuous probabilistic latent space to infer directed information flow among critical circuits, characterizing disease-altered whole-brain inter-circuit interactions. Rigorous leave-one-site-out cross-validation on the REST-meta-MDD dataset demonstrates NH-GCAT's state-of-the-art performance in depression classification, achieving a sample-size weighted-average accuracy of 73.3\% and an AUROC of 76.4\%, while simultaneously providing neurobiologically meaningful explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for ICLR 2026</p></details> |

We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\%/90\%/88\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[Gradient-Based Join Ordering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14482v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Join ordering is the NP-hard problem of selecting the most efficient sequence in which to evaluate joins (conjunctive, binary operators) in a database query. As the performance of query execution critically depends on this choice, join ordering lies at the core of query optimization. Traditional approaches cast this problem as a discrete combinatorial search over binary trees guided by a cost model, but they often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. We show that, when the cost model is differentiable, the query plans can be continuously relaxed into a soft adjacency matrix representing a superposition of plans. This continuous relaxation, together with a Gumbel-Softmax parameterization of the adjacency matrix and differentiable constraints enforcing plan validity, enables gradient-based search for plans within this relaxed space. Using a learned Graph Neural Network as the cost model, we demonstrate that this gradient-based approach can find comparable and even lower-cost plans compared to traditional discrete local search methods on two different graph datasets. Furthermore, we empirically show that the runtime of this approach scales linearly with query size, in contrast to quadratic or exponential runtimes of classical approaches. We believe this first step towards gradient-based join ordering can lead to more effective and efficient query optimizers in the future.</p></details> |  |

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks Based Analog Circuit Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10240v5)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Circuit link prediction, which identifies missing component connections from incomplete netlists, is crucial in analog circuit design automation. However, existing methods face three main challenges: 1) Insufficient use of topological patterns in circuit graphs reduces prediction accuracy; 2) Data scarcity due to the complexity of annotations hinders model generalization; 3) Limited adaptability to various netlist formats restricts model flexibility. We propose Graph Neural Networks Based Analog Circuit Link Prediction (GNN-ACLP), a graph neural networks (GNNs) based method featuring three innovations to tackle these challenges. First, we introduce the SEAL (learning from Subgraphs, Embeddings, and Attributes for Link prediction) framework and achieve port-level accuracy in circuit link prediction. Second, we propose Netlist Babel Fish, a netlist format conversion tool that leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a large language model (LLM) to enhance the compatibility of netlist formats. Finally, we build a comprehensive dataset, SpiceNetlist, comprising 775 annotated circuits of 7 different types across 10 component classes. Experiments demonstrate accuracy improvements of 16.08% on SpiceNetlist, 11.38% on Image2Net, and 16.01% on Masala-CHAI compared to the baseline in intra-dataset evaluation, while maintaining accuracy from 92.05% to 99.07% in cross-dataset evaluation, demonstrating robust feature transfer capabilities. However, its linear computational complexity makes processing large-scale netlists challenging and requires future addressing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data will be made available on request to the corresponding author</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose a method that approximates the dataset topology by constructing adjacency graphs using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection. This approach captures nonlinear correlations within the data, significantly improving the performance of machine learning algorithms, particularly in processing Hyperspectral Images (HSI) from X-ray transmission spectroscopy. This technique not only preserves the global structure of the data but also enhances feature separability, leading to more accurate and robust classification results.</p></details> |  |

Traditional community discovery algorithms mainly focus on the formation and dissolution of links between nodes, and thus fail to capture richer spatial and temporal patterns underlying network evolution. To address this limitation, we propose GTENN, a spatiotemporal graph neural framework for community discovery in dynamic social networks. GTENN integrates spatial structure and temporal dynamics within a unified embedding architecture. First, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) are employed to aggregate latent spatial information and learn expressive node representations at each snapshot. Next, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are used to model temporal evolutions of node embeddings, effectively capturing node dynamism and relationship propagation across time. Finally, a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is applied to the learned spatiotemporal embeddings to cluster nodes and infer their community affiliations. We conduct experiments on four types of dynamic networks, and the results show that GTENN consistently outperforms traditional community discovery algorithms in terms of purity, normalized mutual information, homogeneity, and completeness. These findings demonstrate the superior ability of GTENN to accurately uncover evolving community structures hidden in dynamic social networks.</p></details> | 24 pages, 11 figures |

Recently developed methods, such as those based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and Transformers, demonstrate exceptional performance across various datasets by effectively extracting structural information. However, the benchmarking of these novel methods often varies significantly in terms of hyperparameter settings and datasets, which limits algorithmic progress. In view of these, we conducted a comprehensive survey and benchmark for drug-target interaction modeling from a structural perspective via integrating tens of explicit (i.e., GNN-based) and implicit (i.e., Transformer-based) structure learning algorithms. We conducted a macroscopical comparison between these two classes of encoding strategies as well as the different featurization techniques that inform molecules' chemical and physical properties. We then carry out the microscopical comparison between all the integrated models across the six datasets via comprehensively benchmarking their effectiveness and efficiency. To ensure fairness, we investigate model performance under individually optimized configuration. Remarkably, the summarized insights from the benchmark studies lead to the design of model combos. We demonstrate that our combos can achieve new state-of-the-art performance on various datasets associated with cost-effective memory and computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certified Signed Graph Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14168v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed graphs model complex relationships through positive and negative edges, with widespread real-world applications. Given the sensitive nature of such data, selective removal mechanisms have become essential for privacy protection. While graph unlearning enables the removal of specific data influences from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing methods are designed for conventional GNNs and overlook the unique heterogeneous properties of signed graphs. When applied to Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), these methods lose critical sign information, degrading both model utility and unlearning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), which provides provable privacy guarantees while preserving the sociological principles underlying SGNNs. CSGU employs a three-stage method: (1) efficiently identifying minimal influenced neighborhoods via triangular structures, (2) applying sociological theories to quantify node importance for optimal privacy budget allocation, and (3) performing importance-weighted parameter updates to achieve certified modifications with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSGU outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in both utility preservation and unlearning effectiveness on SGNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fairness-Aware Graph Representation Learning with Limited Demographic Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13540v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring fairness in Graph Neural Networks is fundamental to promoting trustworthy and socially responsible machine learning systems. In response, numerous fair graph learning methods have been proposed in recent years. However, most of them assume full access to demographic information, a requirement rarely met in practice due to privacy, legal, or regulatory restrictions. To this end, this paper introduces a novel fair graph learning framework that mitigates bias in graph learning under limited demographic information. Specifically, we propose a mechanism guided by partial demographic data to generate proxies for demographic information and design a strategy that enforces consistent node embeddings across demographic groups. In addition, we develop an adaptive confidence strategy that dynamically adjusts each node's contribution to fairness and utility based on prediction confidence. We further provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our framework, FairGLite, achieves provable upper bounds on group fairness metrics, offering formal guarantees for bias mitigation. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and fair graph learning frameworks, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in both mitigating bias and maintaining model utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-SimGNN: Adaptive and Robust WiFi Localization Across Dynamic Configurations and Diverse Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14076v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To promote the practicality of deep learning-based localization, existing studies aim to address the issue of scenario dependence through meta-learning. However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Complex-Weighted Convolutional Networks: Provable Expressiveness via Complex Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13937v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications, yet they remain limited by oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled and general mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, opening new avenues for models that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures.

Existing methods often utilize extensive sets of unlabeled amino acid sequences. However, these approaches neither explicitly capture nor harness the accessible protein 3D structural data, which is recognized as a decisive factor in dictating protein functions. To address this, we utilize protein residue graphs and introduce various forms of sequential or structural connections to capture enhanced spatial information. We adeptly combine Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Language Models (LMs), specifically utilizing a pre-trained transformer-based protein language model to encode amino acid sequences and employing message-passing mechanisms like GCN and R-GCN to capture geometric characteristics of protein structures. Employing convolution within a specific node's nearby region, including relations, we stack multiple convolutional layers to efficiently learn combined insights from the protein's spatial graph, revealing intricate interconnections and dependencies in its structural arrangement. To assess our model's performance, we employed the training dataset provided by NetSurfP-2.0, which outlines secondary structure in 3-and 8-states. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model, SSRGNet surpasses the baseline on f1-scores.</p></details> | 40 pages |

However, identifying effective reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode, specifically in the context of cellular reprogramming. To solve it, we devise GATTACA, a scalable computational framework. To facilitate scalability of our framework, we consider previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and improve the procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. We then incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolution operations into the artificial neural network approximator of the DRL agent's action-value function. This allows us to leverage the available knowledge on the structure of a biological system and to indirectly, yet effectively, encode the system's modelled dynamics into a latent representation. Experiments on several large-scale, real-world biological networks from the literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Traditional autoregressive machine learning models often fail in these tasks as minor errors accumulate and lead to rapid forecast degradation. To address this problem, we propose NeuralOM, a general neural operator framework designed for simulating complex, slow-changing dynamics. NeuralOM's core consists of two key innovations: (1) a Progressive Residual Correction Framework that decomposes the forecasting task into a series of fine-grained refinement steps, effectively suppressing long-term error accumulation; and (2) a Physics-Guided Graph Network whose built-in adaptive messaging mechanism explicitly models multi-scale physical interactions, such as gradient-driven flows and multiplicative couplings, thereby enhancing physical consistency while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate NeuralOM on the challenging task of global Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) ocean simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralOM not only surpasses state-of-the-art models in forecast accuracy and long-term stability, but also excels in simulating extreme events. For instance, at a 60-day lead time, NeuralOM achieves a 13.3% lower RMSE compared to the best-performing baseline, offering a stable, efficient, and physically-aware paradigm for data-driven scientific computing.

This work presents a computer vision based framework for group activity recognition and action spotting using a combination of deep learning models and graph based relational reasoning. The system first applies Mask R-CNN to obtain accurate actor localization through bounding boxes and instance masks. Multiple backbone networks, including Inception V3, MobileNet, and VGG16, are used to extract feature maps, and RoIAlign is applied to preserve spatial alignment when generating actor specific features. The mask information is then fused with the feature maps to obtain refined masked feature representations for each actor. To model interactions between individuals, we construct Actor Relation Graphs that encode appearance similarity and positional relations using methods such as normalized cross correlation, sum of absolute differences, and dot product. Graph Convolutional Networks operate on these graphs to reason about relationships and predict both individual actions and group level activities. Experiments on the Collective Activity dataset demonstrate that the combination of mask based feature refinement, robust similarity search, and graph neural network reasoning leads to improved recognition performance across both crowded and non crowded scenarios. This approach highlights the potential of integrating segmentation, feature extraction, and relational graph reasoning for complex video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often neglect gene-gene regulatory relationships and lack stability across datasets, leading to conflation of spurious correlations with genuine causal effects. To address these issues, we develop a causal graph neural network (Causal-GNN) method that integrates causal inference with multi-layer graph neural networks (GNNs). The key innovation is the incorporation of causal effect estimation for identifying stable biomarkers, coupled with a GNN-based propensity scoring mechanism that leverages cross-gene regulatory networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves consistently high predictive accuracy across four distinct datasets and four independent classifiers. Moreover, it enables the identification of more stable biomarkers compared to traditional methods. Our work provides a robust, efficient, and biologically interpretable tool for biomarker discovery, demonstrating strong potential for broad application across medical disciplines.</p></details> |  |

To establish these results, we apply methods from finite model theory of first-order and modal logics to the domain of graph representation learning. Our results provide a unifying framework for understanding the logical expressiveness of GNNs within FO.</p></details> | 21 pages |

However, in practice, task durations are subject to uncertainty that must be considered in order to propose resilient scheduling. In this paper, we address the RCPSP variant with uncertain tasks duration (modeled using known probabilities) and aim to minimize the overall expected project duration. Our objective is to produce a baseline schedule that can be reused multiple times in an industrial setting regardless of the actual duration scenario. We leverage Graph Neural Networks in conjunction with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop an effective policy for task scheduling. This policy operates similarly to a priority dispatch rule and is paired with a Serial Schedule Generation Scheme to produce a schedule. Our empirical evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates the approach's superiority in terms of performance and its ability to generalize.

We propose a learning-to-optimize approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict active sets in the dual active-set solver DAQP. The method exploits the structural properties of QPs by representing them as bipartite graphs and learning to identify the optimal active set for efficiently warm-starting the solver. Across varying problem sizes, the GNN consistently reduces the number of solver iterations compared to cold-starting, while performance is comparable to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) baseline. Furthermore, a GNN trained on varying problem sizes generalizes effectively to unseen dimensions, demonstrating flexibility and scalability. These results highlight the potential of structure-aware learning to accelerate optimization in real-time applications such as model predictive control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review, 15 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

This opacity hinders user trust, complicates debugging, bias detection, and adoption in critical domains requiring explainability. This paper introduces InteractiveGNNExplainer, a visual analytics framework to enhance GNN explainability, focusing on node classification. Our system uniquely integrates coordinated interactive views (dynamic graph layouts, embedding projections, feature inspection, neighborhood analysis) with established post-hoc (GNNExplainer) and intrinsic (GAT attention) explanation techniques. Crucially, it incorporates interactive graph editing, allowing users to perform a "what-if" analysis by perturbing graph structures and observing immediate impacts on GNN predictions and explanations. We detail the system architecture and, through case studies on Cora and CiteSeer datasets, demonstrate how InteractiveGNNExplainer facilitates in-depth misclassification diagnosis, comparative analysis of GCN versus GAT behaviors, and rigorous probing of model sensitivity. These capabilities foster a deeper, multifaceted understanding of GNN predictions, contributing to more transparent, trustworthy, and robust graph analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning of Graph Representations for Network Intrusion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16625v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting intrusions in network traffic is a challenging task, particularly under limited supervision and constantly evolving attack patterns. While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information.

| **[Real-time prediction of breast cancer sites using deformation-aware graph neural network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13082v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial, enabling the establishment of appropriate treatment plans and markedly enhancing patient prognosis. While direct magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy demonstrates promising performance in detecting cancer lesions, its practical application is limited by prolonged procedure times and high costs. To overcome these issues, an indirect MRI-guided biopsy that allows the procedure to be performed outside of the MRI room has been proposed, but it still faces challenges in creating an accurate real-time deformable breast model. In our study, we tackled this issue by developing a graph neural network (GNN)-based model capable of accurately predicting deformed breast cancer sites in real time during biopsy procedures. An individual-specific finite element (FE) model was developed by incorporating magnetic resonance (MR) image-derived structural information of the breast and tumor to simulate deformation behaviors. A GNN model was then employed, designed to process surface displacement and distance-based graph data, enabling accurate prediction of overall tissue displacement, including the deformation of the tumor region. The model was validated using phantom and real patient datasets, achieving an accuracy within 0.2 millimeters (mm) for cancer node displacement (RMSE) and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.977 for spatial overlap with actual cancerous regions. Additionally, the model enabled real-time inference and achieved a speed-up of over 4,000 times in computational cost compared to conventional FE simulations. The proposed deformation-aware GNN model offers a promising solution for real-time tumor displacement prediction in breast biopsy, with high accuracy and real-time capability. Its integration with clinical procedures could significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13062v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over graph-structured data, yet recent studies have shown that their performance gains are beginning to plateau. In many cases, well-established models such as GCN and GAT, when appropriately tuned, can match or even exceed the performance of more complex, state-of-the-art architectures. This trend highlights a key limitation in the current landscape: the difficulty of selecting the most suitable model for a given graph task or dataset. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models (SAGMM), a modular and practical framework that learns to automatically select and combine the most appropriate GNN models from a diverse pool of architectures. Unlike prior mixture-of-experts approaches that rely on variations of a single base model, SAGMM leverages architectural diversity and a topology-aware attention gating mechanism to adaptively assign experts to each node based on the structure of the input graph. To improve efficiency, SAGMM includes a pruning mechanism that reduces the number of active experts during training and inference without compromising performance. We also explore a training-efficient variant in which expert models are pretrained and frozen, and only the gating and task-specific layers are trained. We evaluate SAGMM on 16 benchmark datasets covering node classification, graph classification, regression, and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms or matches leading GNN baselines and prior mixture-based methods, offering a robust and adaptive solution for real-world graph learning.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MAT-MPNN: A Mobility-Aware Transformer-MPNN Model for Dynamic Spatiotemporal Prediction of HIV Diagnoses in California, Florida, and New England](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13797v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has posed a major global health challenge for decades, and forecasting HIV diagnoses continues to be a critical area of research. However, capturing the complex spatial and temporal dependencies of HIV transmission remains challenging. Conventional Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) models rely on a fixed binary adjacency matrix that only encodes geographic adjacency, which is unable to represent interactions between non-contiguous counties. Our study proposes a deep learning architecture Mobility-Aware Transformer-Message Passing Neural Network (MAT-MPNN) framework to predict county-level HIV diagnosis rates across California, Florida, and the New England region. The model combines temporal features extracted by a Transformer encoder with spatial relationships captured through a Mobility Graph Generator (MGG). The MGG improves conventional adjacency matrices by combining geographic and demographic information. Compared with the best-performing hybrid baseline, the Transformer MPNN model, MAT-MPNN reduced the Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE) by 27.9% in Florida, 39.1% in California, and 12.5% in New England, and improved the Predictive Model Choice Criterion (PMCC) by 7.7%, 3.5%, and 3.9%, respectively. MAT-MPNN also achieved better results than the Spatially Varying Auto-Regressive (SVAR) model in Florida and New England, with comparable performance in California. These results demonstrate that applying mobility-aware dynamic spatial structures substantially enhances predictive accuracy and calibration in spatiotemporal epidemiological prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 20 figures,1 table.

| **[Are Graph Transformers Necessary? Efficient Long-Range Message Passing with Fractal Nodes in MPNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13010v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, but often struggle to balance local and global information. While graph Transformers aim to address this by enabling long-range interactions, they often overlook the inherent locality and efficiency of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). We propose a new concept called fractal nodes, inspired by the fractal structure observed in real-world networks. Our approach is based on the intuition that graph partitioning naturally induces fractal structure, where subgraphs often reflect the connectivity patterns of the full graph. Fractal nodes are designed to coexist with the original nodes and adaptively aggregate subgraph-level feature representations, thereby enforcing feature similarity within each subgraph. We show that fractal nodes alleviate the over-squashing problem by providing direct shortcut connections that enable long-range propagation of subgraph-level representations. Experiment results show that our method improves the expressive power of MPNNs and achieves comparable or better performance to graph Transformers while maintaining the computational efficiency of MPNN by improving the long-range dependencies of MPNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026 for Oral Representation.

| **[Esim: EVM Bytecode Similarity Detection Based on Stable-Semantic Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12971v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is experiencing rapid expansion. However, prevalent code reuse and limited open-source contributions have introduced significant challenges to the blockchain ecosystem, including plagiarism and the propagation of vulnerable code. Consequently, an effective and accurate similarity detection method for EVM bytecode is urgently needed to identify similar contracts. Traditional binary similarity detection methods are typically based on instruction stream or control flow graph (CFG), which have limitations on EVM bytecode due to specific features like low-level EVM bytecode and heavily-reused basic blocks. Moreover, the highly-diverse Solidity Compiler (Solc) versions further complicate accurate similarity detection. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel EVM bytecode representation called Stable-Semantic Graph (SSG), which captures relationships between 'stable instructions' (special instructions identified by our study). Moreover, we implement a prototype, Esim, which embeds SSG into matrices for similarity detection using a heterogeneous graph neural network. Esim demonstrates high accuracy in SSG construction, achieving F1-scores of 100% for control flow and 95.16% for data flow, and its similarity detection performance reaches 96.3% AUC, surpassing traditional approaches. Our large-scale study, analyzing 2,675,573 smart contracts on six EVM-compatible chains over a one-year period, also demonstrates that Esim outperforms the SOTA tool Etherscan in vulnerability search.</p></details> |  |
| **[Connectivity-Guided Sparsification of 2-FWL GNNs: Preserving Full Expressivity with Improved Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12838v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order Graph Neural Networks (HOGNNs) based on the 2-FWL test achieve superior expressivity by modeling 2- and 3-node interactions, but at $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ computational cost. However, this computational burden is typically mitigated by existing efficiency methods at the cost of reduced expressivity. We propose \textbf{Co-Sparsify}, a connectivity-aware sparsification framework that eliminates \emph{provably redundant} computations while preserving full 2-FWL expressive power. Our key insight is that 3-node interactions are expressively necessary only within \emph{biconnected components} -- maximal subgraphs where every pair of nodes lies on a cycle. Outside these components, structural relationships can be fully captured via 2-node message passing or global readout, rendering higher-order modeling unnecessary. Co-Sparsify restricts 2-node message passing to connected components and 3-node interactions to biconnected ones, removing computation without approximation or sampling. We prove that Co-Sparsified GNNs are as expressive as the 2-FWL test. Empirically, on PPGN, Co-Sparsify matches or exceeds accuracy on synthetic substructure counting tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmarks (ZINC, QM9). This study demonstrates that high expressivity and scalability are not mutually exclusive: principled, topology-guided sparsification enables powerful, efficient GNNs with theoretical guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Event-CausNet: Unlocking Causal Knowledge from Text with Large Language Models for Reliable Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12769v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling recurring traffic patterns, their reliability plummets during non-recurring events like accidents. This failure occurs because GNNs are fundamentally correlational models, learning historical patterns that are invalidated by the new causal factors introduced during disruptions. To address this, we propose Event-CausNet, a framework that uses a Large Language Model to quantify unstructured event reports, builds a causal knowledge base by estimating average treatment effects, and injects this knowledge into a dual-stream GNN-LSTM network using a novel causal attention mechanism to adjust and enhance the forecast. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that Event-CausNet achieves robust performance, reducing prediction error (MAE) by up to 35.87%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our framework bridges the gap between correlational models and causal reasoning, providing a solution that is more accurate and transferable, while also offering crucial interpretability, providing a more reliable foundation for real-world traffic management during critical disruptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the Generalisation of Learned Reconstruction Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12730v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring proper generalization is a critical challenge in applying data-driven methods for solving inverse problems in imaging, as neural networks reconstructing an image must perform well across varied datasets and acquisition geometries. In X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to filter the projection data but are ill-suited for this task as they apply grid-based convolutions to the sinogram, which inherently lies on a line manifold, not a regular grid. The CNNs, unaware of the geometry, are implicitly tied to it and require an excessive amount of parameters as they must infer the relations between measurements from the data rather than from prior information. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a graph data structure to represent CT acquisition geometries and tomographic data, providing a detailed explanation of the graph's structure for circular, cone-beam geometries. Second, we propose GLM, a hybrid neural network architecture that leverages both graph and grid convolutions to process tomographic data. We demonstrate that GLM outperforms CNNs when performance is quantified in terms of structural similarity and peak signal-to-noise ratio, despite the fact that GLM uses only a fraction of the trainable parameters. Compared to CNNs, GLM also requires significantly less training time and memory, and its memory requirements scale better. Crucially, GLM demonstrates robust generalization to unseen variations in the acquisition geometry, like when training only on fully sampled CT data and then testing on sparse-view CT data.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Adaptive Graph Rewiring to Mitigate Over-Squashing in Mesh-Based GNNs for Fluid Dynamics Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12709v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mesh-based simulation using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been recognized as a promising approach for modeling fluid dynamics. However, the mesh refinement techniques which allocate finer resolution to regions with steep gradients can induce the over-squashing problem in mesh-based GNNs, which prevents the capture of long-range physical interactions. Conventional graph rewiring methods attempt to alleviate this issue by adding new edges, but they typically complete all rewiring operations before applying them to the GNN. These approaches are physically unrealistic, as they assume instantaneous interactions between distant nodes and disregard the distance information between particles. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, called Adaptive Graph Rewiring in Mesh-Based Graph Neural Networks (AdaMeshNet), that introduces an adaptive rewiring process into the message-passing procedure to model the gradual propagation of physical interactions. Our method computes a rewiring delay score for bottleneck nodes in the mesh graph, based on the shortest-path distance and the velocity difference. Using this score, it dynamically selects the message-passing layer at which new edges are rewired, which can lead to adaptive rewiring in a mesh graph. Extensive experiments on mesh-based fluid simulations demonstrate that AdaMeshNet outperforms conventional rewiring methods, effectively modeling the sequential nature of physical interactions and enabling more accurate predictions.</p></details> | Preprint |
