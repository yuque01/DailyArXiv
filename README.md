| **[Interactive Recommendation Agent with Active User Commands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21317v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes.</p></details> | Under Review |

Human in the loop shortcomings can increase the risk of failures in recommender systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20099v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are among the most commonly deployed systems today. Systems design approaches to AI-powered recommender systems have done well to urge recommender system developers to follow more intentional data collection, curation, and management procedures. So too has the "human-in-the-loop" paradigm been widely adopted, primarily to address the issue of accountability. However, in this paper, we take the position that human oversight in recommender system design also entails novel risks that have yet to be fully described. These risks are "codetermined" by the information context in which such systems are often deployed. Furthermore, new knowledge of the shortcomings of "human-in-the-loop" practices to deliver meaningful oversight of other AI systems suggest that they may also be inadequate for achieving socially responsible recommendations. We review how the limitations of human oversight may increase the chances of a specific kind of failure: a "cascade" or "compound" failure. We then briefly explore how the unique dynamics of three common deployment contexts can make humans in the loop more likely to fail in their oversight duties. We then conclude with two recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rejuvenating Cross-Entropy Loss in Knowledge Distillation for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20989v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper analyzes Cross-Entropy (CE) loss in knowledge distillation (KD) for recommender systems. KD for recommender systems targets at distilling rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our goal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items. We empirically demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether they are highly ranked by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RCE-KD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Graph-Transformer Out-of-Distribution Generalization Abilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20575v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID) benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts. Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without specialized DG algorithms (on four out of six benchmarks). Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets, specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Highlighting its model-agnostic design, the method yielded valuable insights into both GT and MPNN backbones and appears well suited for broader DG applications beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Representation-disentangled Information Bottleneck for Multimodal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20225v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal data has significantly advanced recommendation systems by integrating diverse information sources to model user preferences and item characteristics. However, these systems often struggle with redundant and irrelevant information, which can degrade performance. Most existing methods either fuse multimodal information directly or use rigid architectural separation for disentanglement, failing to adequately filter noise and model the complex interplay between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, the Multimodal Representation-disentangled Information Bottleneck (MRdIB). Concretely, we first employ a Multimodal Information Bottleneck to compress the input representations, effectively filtering out task-irrelevant noise while preserving rich semantic information. Then, we decompose the information based on its relationship with the recommendation target into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. We achieve this decomposition with a series of constraints: a unique information learning objective to preserve modality-unique signals, a redundant information learning objective to minimize overlap, and a synergistic information learning objective to capture emergent information. By optimizing these objectives, MRdIB guides a model to learn more powerful and disentangled representations. Extensive experiments on several competitive models and three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our MRdIB in enhancing multimodal recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intelligent Algorithm Selection for Recommender Systems: Meta-Learning via in-depth algorithm feature engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20134v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The "No Free Lunch" theorem dictates that no single recommender algorithm is optimal for all users, creating a significant Algorithm Selection Problem. Standard meta-learning approaches aim to solve this by selecting an algorithm based on user features, but treat the fundamentally diverse algorithms themselves as equivalent, "black-box" choices. This thesis investigates the impact of overcoming this limitation by engineering a comprehensive feature set to explicitly characterize the algorithms themselves. We combine static code metrics, Abstract Syntax Tree properties, behavioral performance landmarks, and high-level conceptual features. We evaluate two meta-learners across five datasets: a baseline using only user features and our proposed model using both user and algorithm features. Our results show that the meta-learner augmented with algorithm features achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.143, a statistically significant improvement of 11.7% over the Single Best Algorithm baseline (0.128). However, we found that the inclusion of algorithm features did not lead to an improvement in overall NDCG@10 over the meta learner using only user features (0.144). While adding algorithm features to the meta-learner did improve its Top-1 selection accuracy (+16.1%), this was counterbalanced by leading to a lower Top-3 accuracy (-10.7%). We conclude that for the per-user algorithm selection task in recommender systems, the predictive power of user features is overwhelmingly dominant. While algorithm features improve selection precision, unlocking their potential to boost overall performance remains a non-trivial challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[UnifiedRL: A Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Tailored for Multi-Task Fusion in Large-Scale Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17589v6)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the last pivotal stage of Recommender System (RS), Multi-Task Fusion (MTF) is responsible for combining multiple scores outputted by Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model into a final score to maximize user satisfaction. Recently, to optimize long-term user satisfaction, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used for MTF in RSs. However, the existing offline RL algorithms used for MTF have the following severe problems: a) To avoid Out-of-Distribution (OOD), their constraints are overly strict, which seriously damage performance; b) They are unaware of the exploration policy used to collect training data, only suboptimal policy can be learned; c) Their exploration policies are inefficient and hurt user experience. To solve the above problems, we propose an innovative method called UnifiedRL tailored for MTF in large-scale RSs. UnifiedRL seamlessly integrates offline RL model with its custom exploration policy to relax overly strict constraints, which is different from existing RL-MTF methods and significantly improves performance. In addition, compared to existing exploration policies, UnifiedRL's custom exploration policy is highly efficient, enabling frequent online exploration and offline training iterations, which further improves performance. Extensive offline and online experiments are conducted in a large-scale RS. The results demonstrate that UnifiedRL outperforms other existing MTF methods remarkably, achieving a +4.64% increase in user valid consumption and a +1.74% increase in user duration time. To the best of our knowledge, UnifiedRL is the first RL algorithm tailored for MTF in RSs and has been successfully deployed in multiple large-scale RSs since June 2023, yielding significant benefits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Model Evolutionary Algorithms for Recommender Systems: Benchmarks and Algorithm Comparisons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10697v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolutionary computing community, the remarkable language-handling capabilities and reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the functionality of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), enabling them to tackle optimization problems involving structured language or program code. Although this field is still in its early stages, its impressive potential has led to the development of various LLM-based EAs. To effectively evaluate the performance and practical applicability of these LLM-based EAs, benchmarks with real-world relevance are essential. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based recommender systems (RSs) and introduce a benchmark problem set, named RSBench, specifically designed to assess the performance of LLM-based EAs in recommendation prompt optimization. RSBench emphasizes session-based recommendations, aiming to discover a set of Pareto optimal prompts that guide the recommendation process, providing accurate, diverse, and fair recommendations. We develop three LLM-based EAs based on established EA frameworks and experimentally evaluate their performance using RSBench. Our study offers valuable insights into the application of EAs in LLM-based RSs. Additionally, we explore key components that may influence the overall performance of the RS, providing meaningful guidance for future research on the development of LLM-based EAs in RSs. The source code of the proposed RSBench can be found at https://github.com/LiuJ-2023/RSBench/tree/main.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shilling Recommender Systems by Generating Side-feature-aware Fake User Profiles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17918v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RS) greatly influence users' consumption decisions, making them attractive targets for malicious shilling attacks that inject fake user profiles to manipulate recommendations. Existing shilling methods can generate effective and stealthy fake profiles when training data only contain rating matrix, but they lack comprehensive solutions for scenarios where side features are present and utilized by the recommender. To address this gap, we extend the Leg-UP framework by enhancing the generator architecture to incorporate side features, enabling the generation of side-feature-aware fake user profiles. Experiments on benchmarks show that our method achieves strong attack performance while maintaining stealthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal-enhanced Federated Recommendation: A Group-wise Fusion Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19955v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Recommendation (FR) is a new learning paradigm to tackle the learn-to-rank problem in a privacy-preservation manner. How to integrate multi-modality features into federated recommendation is still an open challenge in terms of efficiency, distribution heterogeneity, and fine-grained alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal fusion mechanism in federated recommendation settings (GFMFR). Specifically, it offloads multimodal representation learning to the server, which stores item content and employs a high-capacity encoder to generate expressive representations, alleviating client-side overhead. Moreover, a group-aware item representation fusion approach enables fine-grained knowledge sharing among similar users while retaining individual preferences. The proposed fusion loss could be simply plugged into any existing federated recommender systems empowering their capability by adding multi-modality features. Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that GFMFR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal FR baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equip Pre-ranking with Target Attention by Residual Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16931v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-ranking stage in industrial recommendation systems faces a fundamental conflict between efficiency and effectiveness. While powerful models like Target Attention (TA) excel at capturing complex feature interactions in the ranking stage, their high computational cost makes them infeasible for pre-ranking, which often relies on simplistic vector-product models. This disparity creates a significant performance bottleneck for the entire system. To bridge this gap, we propose TARQ, a novel pre-ranking framework. Inspired by generative models, TARQ's key innovation is to equip pre-ranking with an architecture approximate to TA by Residual Quantization. This allows us to bring the modeling power of TA into the latency-critical pre-ranking stage for the first time, establishing a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Extensive offline experiments and large-scale online A/B tests at Taobao demonstrate TARQ's significant improvements in ranking performance. Consequently, our model has been fully deployed in production, serving tens of millions of daily active users and yielding substantial business improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to WSDM 2026 Short Paper Track</p></details> |
| **[GSPRec: Temporal-Aware Graph Spectral Filtering for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11552v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based recommendation systems are effective at modeling collaborative patterns but often suffer from two limitations: overreliance on low-pass filtering, which suppresses user-specific signals, and omission of sequential dynamics in graph construction. We introduce GSPRec, a graph spectral model that integrates temporal transitions through sequentially-informed graph construction and applies frequency-aware filtering in the spectral domain. GSPRec encodes item transitions via multi-hop diffusion to enable the use of symmetric Laplacians for spectral processing. To capture user preferences, we design a dual-filtering mechanism: a Gaussian bandpass filter to extract mid-frequency, user-level patterns, and a low-pass filter to retain global trends. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that GSPRec consistently outperforms baselines, with an average improvement of 6.77% in NDCG@10. Ablation studies show the complementary benefits of both sequential graph augmentation and bandpass filtering.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Hidden Cost of Defaults in Recommender System Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21180v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperparameter optimization is critical for improving the performance of recommender systems, yet its implementation is often treated as a neutral or secondary concern. In this work, we shift focus from model benchmarking to auditing the behavior of RecBole, a widely used recommendation framework. We show that RecBole's internal defaults, particularly an undocumented early-stopping policy, can prematurely terminate Random Search and Bayesian Optimization. This limits search coverage in ways that are not visible to users. Using six models and two datasets, we compare search strategies and quantify both performance variance and search path instability. Our findings reveal that hidden framework logic can introduce variability comparable to the differences between search strategies. These results highlight the importance of treating frameworks as active components of experimental design and call for more transparent, reproducibility-aware tooling in recommender systems research. We provide actionable recommendations for researchers and developers to mitigate hidden configuration behaviors and improve the transparency of hyperparameter tuning workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RecSys 2025</p></details> |
| **[From latent factors to language: a user study on LLM-generated explanations for an inherently interpretable matrix-based recommender system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18980v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can generate effective, user-facing explanations from a mathematically interpretable recommendation model. The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations themselves.To evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary insights beyond the quantitative results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic User Interest Augmentation via Stream Clustering and Memory Networks in Large-Scale Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13238v7)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender System (RS) provides personalized recommendation service based on user interest. However, lots of users' interests are sparse due to lacking consumption behaviors, making it challenging to provide accurate recommendations for them, which is widespread in large-scale RSs. In particular, efficiently solving this problem in the ranking stage of RS is an even greater challenge, which requires an end-to-end and real-time approach. To solve this problem, we propose an innovative method called Dynamic User Interest Augmentation (DUIA). DUIA enhances user interest including user profile and user history behavior sequences by generating enhancement vectors and personalized enhancement vectors through dynamic stream clustering of similar users and relevant items from multiple perspectives. To realize stream clustering, we specially design an algorithm called Gradient-based Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm (GHCA) for DUIA, which performs clustering via gradient descent and stores the cluster centers in memory networks. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate that DUIA not only significantly improves model performance for users with sparse interests but also delivers notable gains for other users. As an end-to-end method, DUIA can be easily integrated with existing models. Furthermore, DUIA is also used for long-tail items and cold-start problem, which also yields excellent improvements. Since 2022, DUIA has been successfully deployed in multiple industrial RSs in Tencent and was made public in May 2024. Moreover, the thoughts behind DUIA, dynamic stream clustering and similarity-based enhancement, have inspired relevant works and have also been applied in other stages of RS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Branch Network Architectures to Close the Modality Gap in Multimodal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18807v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommender systems rely on collaborative filtering, using past user-item interactions to help users discover new items in a vast collection. In cold start, i.e., when interaction histories of users or items are not available, content-based recommender systems use side information instead. Hybrid recommender systems (HRSs) often employ multimodal learning to combine collaborative and side information, which we jointly refer to as modalities. Though HRSs can provide recommendations when some modalities are missing, their quality degrades. In this work, we utilize single-branch neural networks equipped with weight sharing, modality sampling, and contrastive loss to provide accurate recommendations even in missing modality scenarios by narrowing the modality gap. We compare these networks with multi-branch alternatives and conduct extensive experiments on three datasets. Six accuracy-based and four beyond-accuracy-based metrics help assess the recommendation quality for the different training paradigms and their hyperparameters in warm-start and missing modality scenarios. We quantitatively and qualitatively study the effects of these different aspects on bridging the modality gap. Our results show that single-branch networks achieve competitive performance in warm-start scenarios and are significantly better in missing modality settings. Moreover, our approach leads to closer proximity of an item's modalities in the embedding space. Our full experimental setup is available at https://github.com/hcai-mms/single-branch-networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (TORS)</p></details> |
| **[Robust Denoising Neural Reranker for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18736v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For multi-stage recommenders in industry, a user request would first trigger a simple and efficient retriever module that selects and ranks a list of relevant items, then calls a slower but more sophisticated deep reranking model that refines the item arrangement before exposure to the user. The latter model typically reranks the item list conditioned on the user's history content and the initial ranking from retrievers. Although this two-stage retrieval-ranking framework demonstrates practical effectiveness, the significance of retriever scores from the previous stage has been limitedly explored, which is informative. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the limitations of using retriever scores as the rerankers' input directly and argue that the reranking task is essentially a noise reduction problem from the retriever scores. Following this notion, we derive an adversarial framework, DNR, that associates the denoising reranker with a carefully designed noise generation module. We extend the conventional score error minimization term with three augmented objectives, including: 1) a denoising objective that aims to denoise the noisy retriever scores to align with the user feedback; 2) an adversarial retriever score generation objective that improves the exploration in the retriever score space; and 3) a distribution regularization term that aims to align the distribution of generated noisy retriever scores with the real ones. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, together with analytical support, validating the effectiveness of the proposed DNR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understand your Users, An Ensemble Learning Framework for Natural Noise Filtering in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18560v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of web content is a major key to the success for Recommender Systems. This paper addresses the challenge of defining noise, which is inherently related to variability in human preferences and behaviors. In classifying changes in user tendencies, we distinguish three kinds of phenomena: external factors that directly influence users' sentiment, serendipity causing unexpected preference, and incidental interaction perceived as noise. To overcome these problems, we present a new framework that identifies noisy ratings. In this context, the proposed framework is modular, consisting of three layers: known natural noise algorithms for item classification, an Ensemble learning model for refined evaluation of the items and signature-based noise identification. We further advocate the metrics that quantitatively assess serendipity and group validation, offering higher robustness in recommendation accuracy. Our approach aims to provide a cleaner training dataset that would inherently improve user satisfaction and engagement with Recommender Systems.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[Actions Speak Louder than Prompts: A Large-Scale Study of LLMs for Graph Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18487v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for text-rich graph machine learning tasks such as node classification in high-impact domains like fraud detection and recommendation systems. Yet, despite a surge of interest, the field lacks a principled understanding of the capabilities of LLMs in their interaction with graph data. In this work, we conduct a large-scale, controlled evaluation across several key axes of variability to systematically assess the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based graph reasoning methods in text-based applications. The axes include the LLM-graph interaction mode, comparing prompting, tool-use, and code generation; dataset domains, spanning citation, web-link, e-commerce, and social networks; structural regimes contrasting homophilic and heterophilic graphs; feature characteristics involving both short- and long-text node attributes; and model configurations with varying LLM sizes and reasoning capabilities. We further analyze dependencies by methodically truncating features, deleting edges, and removing labels to quantify reliance on input types. Our findings provide practical and actionable guidance. (1) LLMs as code generators achieve the strongest overall performance on graph data, with especially large gains on long-text or high-degree graphs where prompting quickly exceeds the token budget. (2) All interaction strategies remain effective on heterophilic graphs, challenging the assumption that LLM-based methods collapse under low homophily. (3) Code generation is able to flexibly adapt its reliance between structure, features, or labels to leverage the most informative input type. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive view of the strengths and limitations of current LLM-graph interaction modes and highlight key design principles for future approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[OnePiece: Bringing Context Engineering and Reasoning to Industrial Cascade Ranking System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18091v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the growing interest in replicating the scaled success of large language models (LLMs) in industrial search and recommender systems, most existing industrial efforts remain limited to transplanting Transformer architectures, which bring only incremental improvements over strong Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs). From a first principle perspective, the breakthroughs of LLMs stem not only from their architectures but also from two complementary mechanisms: context engineering, which enriches raw input queries with contextual cues to better elicit model capabilities, and multi-step reasoning, which iteratively refines model outputs through intermediate reasoning paths. However, these two mechanisms and their potential to unlock substantial improvements remain largely underexplored in industrial ranking systems. In this paper, we propose OnePiece, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into both retrieval and ranking models of industrial cascaded pipelines. OnePiece is built on a pure Transformer backbone and further introduces three key innovations: (1) structured context engineering, which augments interaction history with preference and scenario signals and unifies them into a structured tokenized input sequence for both retrieval and ranking; (2) block-wise latent reasoning, which equips the model with multi-step refinement of representations and scales reasoning bandwidth via block size; (3) progressive multi-task training, which leverages user feedback chains to effectively supervise reasoning steps during training. OnePiece has been deployed in the main personalized search scenario of Shopee and achieves consistent online gains across different key business metrics, including over $+2\%$ GMV/UU and a $+2.90\%$ increase in advertising revenue.</p></details> | <details><summary>OnePi...</summary><p>OnePiece Technical Report; Applied in Shopee</p></details> |
| **[Serendipitous Recommendation with Multimodal LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08283v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional recommendation systems succeed in identifying relevant content but often fail to provide users with surprising or novel items. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) possess the world knowledge and multimodal understanding needed for serendipity, but their integration into billion-item-scale platforms presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework where fine-tuned MLLMs provide high-level guidance to conventional recommendation models, steering them towards more serendipitous suggestions. This approach leverages MLLM strengths in understanding multimodal content and user interests while retaining the efficiency of traditional models for item-level recommendation. This mitigates the complexity of applying MLLMs directly to vast action spaces. We also demonstrate a chain-of-thought strategy enabling MLLMs to discover novel user interests by first understanding video content and then identifying relevant yet unexplored interest clusters. Through live experiments within a commercial short-form video platform serving billions of users, we show that our MLLM-powered approach significantly improves both recommendation serendipity and user satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 Recsys EARL Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Core-elements Subsampling for Alternating Least Squares](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18024v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel element-wise subset selection method for the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm, focusing on low-rank matrix factorization involving matrices with missing values, as commonly encountered in recommender systems. While ALS is widely used for providing personalized recommendations based on user-item interaction data, its high computational cost, stemming from repeated regression operations, poses significant challenges for large-scale datasets. To enhance the efficiency of ALS, we propose a core-elements subsampling method that selects a representative subset of data and leverages sparse matrix operations to approximate ALS estimations efficiently. We establish theoretical guarantees for the approximation and convergence of the proposed approach, showing that it achieves similar accuracy with significantly reduced computational time compared to full-data ALS. Extensive simulations and real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various scenarios, emphasizing its potential in large-scale recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictable Drifts in Collective Cultural Attention: Evidence from Nation-Level Library Takeout Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12007v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting changes in consumer attention for cultural products, such as books, movies, and songs, is notoriously difficult. Past research on predicting the popularity of individual products suggests the existence of intrinsic prediction limits. However, little is known about the limits for predicting collective attention across cultural products. Here, we analyze four years of nationwide library loan data for approximately 2 million individuals, comprising over 100 million loans of more than 660,000 unique books. We find that culture, as measured by popularity distributions of loaned books, drifts continually from month to month at a near-constant rate, leading to a growing divergence over time, and that drifts vary between different book genres. By linking book loans to registry data, we investigate the influence of age, sex, educational level, and geographical area on cultural drift, finding heterogeneous effects from the different demographic groups. Our findings have important implications for market forecasting and developing robust recommender systems, highlighting the need to account for specific drift dynamics for different types of items and demographic groups.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeqUDA-Rec: Sequential User Behavior Enhanced Recommendation via Global Unsupervised Data Augmentation for Personalized Content Marketing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17361v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized content marketing has become a crucial strategy for digital platforms, aiming to deliver tailored advertisements and recommendations that match user preferences. Traditional recommendation systems often suffer from two limitations: (1) reliance on limited supervised signals derived from explicit user feedback, and (2) vulnerability to noisy or unintentional interactions. To address these challenges, we propose SeqUDA-Rec, a novel deep learning framework that integrates user behavior sequences with global unsupervised data augmentation to enhance recommendation accuracy and robustness. Our approach first constructs a Global User-Item Interaction Graph (GUIG) from all user behavior sequences, capturing both local and global item associations. Then, a graph contrastive learning module is applied to generate robust embeddings, while a sequential Transformer-based encoder models users' evolving preferences. To further enhance diversity and counteract sparse supervised labels, we employ a GAN-based augmentation strategy, generating plausible interaction patterns and supplementing training data. Extensive experiments on two real-world marketing datasets (Amazon Ads and TikTok Ad Clicks) demonstrate that SeqUDA-Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as SASRec, BERT4Rec, and GCL4SR. Our model achieves a 6.7% improvement in NDCG@10 and 11.3% improvement in HR@10, proving its effectiveness in personalized advertising and intelligent content recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying and Upweighting Power-Niche Users to Mitigate Popularity Bias in Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17265v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have been shown to exhibit popularity bias by over-recommending popular items and under-recommending relevant niche items. We seek to understand interactions with niche items in benchmark recommendation datasets as a step toward mitigating popularity bias. We find that, compared to mainstream users, niche-preferring users exhibit a longer-tailed activity-level distribution, indicating the existence of users who both prefer niche items and exhibit high activity levels. We partition users along two axes: (1) activity level ("power" vs. "light") and (2) item-popularity preference ("mainstream" vs. "niche"), and show that in several benchmark datasets, the number of power-niche users (high activity and niche preference) is statistically significantly larger than expected under a null configuration model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a framework for reweighting the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss that simultaneously reweights based on user activity level and item popularity. Our method introduces two interpretable parameters: one controlling the significance of user activity level, and the other of item popularity. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that upweighting power-niche users reduces popularity bias and can increase overall performance. In contrast to previous work that only considers user activity level or item popularity in isolation, our results suggest that considering their interaction leads to Pareto-dominant performance.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems risk reinforcing filter bubbles and political polarization by failing to incorporate diverse perspectives. Stance detection -- identifying a text's position on a target -- can help mitigate this by enabling viewpoint-aware recommendations and data-driven analyses of media bias. Yet, existing stance detection research remains largely limited to short texts and high-resource languages. To address these gaps, we introduce \textsc{K-News-Stance}, the first Korean dataset for article-level stance detection, comprising 2,000 news articles with article-level and 21,650 segment-level stance annotations across 47 societal issues. We also propose \textsc{JoA-ICL}, a \textbf{Jo}urnalism-guided \textbf{A}gentic \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{L}earning framework that employs a language model agent to predict the stances of key structural segments (e.g., leads, quotations), which are then aggregated to infer the overall article stance. Experiments showed that \textsc{JoA-ICL} outperforms existing stance detection methods, highlighting the benefits of segment-level agency in capturing the overall position of long-form news articles. Two case studies further demonstrate its broader utility in promoting viewpoint diversity in news recommendations and uncovering patterns of media bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (24 pages)</p></details> |
| **[Temporal-Aware User Behaviour Simulation with Large Language Models for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16895v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-like capabilities in language understanding, reasoning, and generation, driving interest in using LLM-based agents to simulate human feedback in recommender systems. However, most existing approaches rely on static user profiling, neglecting the temporal and dynamic nature of user interests. This limitation stems from a disconnect between language modelling and behaviour modelling, which constrains the capacity of agents to represent sequential patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Temporal-aware Agent-based simulator for Recommender Systems, DyTA4Rec, which enables agents to model and utilise evolving user behaviour based on historical interactions. DyTA4Rec features a dynamic updater for real-time profile refinement, temporal-enhanced prompting for sequential context, and self-adaptive aggregation for coherent feedback. Experimental results at group and individual levels show that DyTA4Rec significantly improves the alignment between simulated and actual user behaviour by modelling dynamic characteristics and enhancing temporal awareness in LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional language model approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework, User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy (SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Recsys'25</p></details> |

Personalized Large Language Models (PLLMs) tackle these challenges by leveraging individual user data, such as user profiles, historical dialogues, content, and interactions, to deliver responses that are contextually relevant and tailored to each user's specific needs. This is a highly valuable research topic, as PLLMs can significantly enhance user satisfaction and have broad applications in conversational agents, recommendation systems, emotion recognition, medical assistants, and more. This survey reviews recent advancements in PLLMs from three technical perspectives: prompting for personalized context (input level), finetuning for personalized adapters (model level), and alignment for personalized preferences (objective level). To provide deeper insights, we also discuss current limitations and outline several promising directions for future research.

Such big models are not only strong performers in practice but also offer a promising way to break out of the task-specific modeling restrictions, thereby enabling task-agnostic and unified ML systems. However, such a popular paradigm is mainly unexplored by the recommender systems (RS) community. A critical issue is that standard recommendation models are primarily built on categorical identity features. That is, the users and the interacted items are represented by their unique IDs, which are generally not shareable across different systems or platforms. To pursue the transferable recommendations, we propose studying pre-trained RS models in a novel scenario where a user's interaction feedback involves a mixture-of-modality (MoM) items, e.g., text and images. We then present TransRec, a very simple modification made on the popular ID-based RS framework. TransRec learns directly from the raw features of the MoM items in an end-to-end training manner and thus enables effective transfer learning under various scenarios without relying on overlapped users or items. We empirically study the transferring ability of TransRec across four different real-world recommendation settings. Besides, we look at its effects by scaling source and target data size. Our results suggest that learning neural recommendation models from MoM feedback provides a promising way to realize universal RS.</p></details> |  |

To provide personalized recommendations tailored to individual interests, the proposed system considers user interaction data, video content features, and contextual information. With the aid of a hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, the system can capture nuanced relationships between users, video attributes, and engagement patterns. Three datasets are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system: Kwai, TikTok, and MovieLens. Compared to baseline models, such as DeepFM, Wide & Deep, LightGBM, and XGBoost, the proposed MMGCN-based model shows superior performance. A notable feature of the proposed model is that it outperforms all baseline methods in capturing diverse user preferences and making accurate, personalized recommendations, resulting in a Kwai F1 score of 0.574, a Tiktok F1 score of 0.506, and a MovieLens F1 score of 0.197. We emphasize the importance of multi-modal integration and user-centric approaches in advancing recommender systems, emphasizing the role they play in enhancing content discovery and audience interaction on live broadcast platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Long-term User Behaviors with Diffusion-driven Multi-interest Network for CTR Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15311v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CTR (Click-Through Rate) prediction, crucial for recommender systems and online advertising, etc., has been confirmed to benefit from modeling long-term user behaviors. Nonetheless, the vast number of behaviors and complexity of noise interference pose challenges to prediction efficiency and effectiveness. Recent solutions have evolved from single-stage models to two-stage models. However, current two-stage models often filter out significant information, resulting in an inability to capture diverse user interests and build the complete latent space of user interests. Inspired by multi-interest and generative modeling, we propose DiffuMIN (Diffusion-driven Multi-Interest Network) to model long-term user behaviors and thoroughly explore the user interest space. Specifically, we propose a target-oriented multi-interest extraction method that begins by orthogonally decomposing the target to obtain interest channels. This is followed by modeling the relationships between interest channels and user behaviors to disentangle and extract multiple user interests. We then adopt a diffusion module guided by contextual interests and interest channels, which anchor users' personalized and target-oriented interest types, enabling the generation of augmented interests that align with the latent spaces of user interests, thereby further exploring restricted interest space. Finally, we leverage contrastive learning to ensure that the generated augmented interests align with users' genuine preferences. Extensive offline experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, yielding results that demonstrate the superiority of DiffuMIN. Moreover, DiffuMIN increased CTR by 1.52% and CPM by 1.10% in online A/B testing. Our source code is available at https://github.com/laiweijiang/DiffuMIN.</p></details> |  |

Target-free User Simulation for Evaluating Conversational Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16160v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have tried to simulate real-world users engaging in conversations with CRSs to create more realistic testing environments that reflect the complexity of human-agent dialogue. Despite the significant advancements, reliably evaluating the capability of CRSs to elicit user preferences still faces a significant challenge. Existing evaluation metrics often rely on target-biased user simulators that assume users have predefined preferences, leading to interactions that devolve into simplistic guessing game. These simulators typically guide the CRS toward specific target items based on fixed attributes, limiting the dynamic exploration of user preferences and struggling to capture the evolving nature of real-user interactions. Additionally, current evaluation metrics are predominantly focused on single-turn recall of target items, neglecting the intermediate processes of preference elicitation. To address this, we introduce PEPPER, a novel CRS evaluation protocol with target-free user simulators constructed from real-user interaction histories and reviews. PEPPER enables realistic user-CRS dialogues without falling into simplistic guessing games, allowing users to gradually discover their preferences through enriched interactions, thereby providing a more accurate and reliable assessment of the CRS's ability to elicit personal preferences. Furthermore, PEPPER presents detailed measures for comprehensively evaluating the preference elicitation capabilities of CRSs, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative measures that capture four distinct aspects of the preference elicitation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the validity of PEPPER as a simulation environment and conduct a thorough analysis of how effectively existing CRSs perform in preference elicitation and recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Most research in RS tends to focus either on predicting users' immediate feedback (like click-through rate) accurately or improving users' long-term engagement. However, they ignore the influence for authors and the lifelong interaction value (LIV) of user-author pairs, which is particularly crucial for improving the prosperity of social community in short-video platforms. Currently, reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize long-term benefits and has been widely applied in RS. In this paper, we introduce RL to Reinforce Lifelong Interaction Value of User-Author pairs (RLIV-UA) based on each interaction of UA pairs. To address the long intervals between UA interactions and the large scale of the UA space, we propose a novel Sparse Cross-Request Interaction Markov Decision Process (SCRI-MDP) and introduce an Adjacent State Approximation (ASA) method to construct RL training samples. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Task Critic Learning (MTCL) to capture the progressive nature of UA interactions (click -> follow -> gift), where denser interaction signals are leveraged to compensate for the learning of sparse labels. Finally, an auxiliary supervised learning task is designed to enhance the convergence of the RLIV-UA model. In offline experiments and online A/B tests, the RLIV-UA model achieves both higher user satisfaction and higher platform profits than compared methods.</p></details> |  |

A Systematic Analysis of Prompts, Models, and Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14979v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantic features has been demonstrated as a powerful paradigm for enhancing Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS). This typically involves three stages: processing item text, extracting features with LLMs, and adapting them for downstream models. However, existing methods vary widely in prompting, architecture, and adaptation strategies, making it difficult to fairly compare design choices and identify what truly drives performance. In this work, we propose RecXplore, a modular analytical framework that decomposes the LLM-as-feature-extractor pipeline into four modules: data processing, semantic feature extraction, feature adaptation, and sequential modeling. Instead of proposing new techniques, RecXplore revisits and organizes established methods, enabling systematic exploration of each module in isolation. Experiments on four public datasets show that simply combining the best designs from existing techniques without exhaustive search yields up to 18.7% relative improvement in NDCG@5 and 12.7% in HR@5 over strong baselines. These results underscore the utility of modular benchmarking for identifying effective design patterns and promoting standardized research in LLM-enhanced recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages.

While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient information interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially address this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture user intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into generative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance. However, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic representations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning pathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these issues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that constructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a self-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations. Specifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook (MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby constructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance the reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement stage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a Multi-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions tailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA introduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization. During inference, Consistency-Oriented Self-Reflection for Pruning (CORP) is proposed to discard inconsistent reasoning paths, preventing the propagation of erroneous reasoning. Lastly, we develop an efficient offline training strategy for large-scale recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets and online evaluations show that REG4Rec delivers outstanding performance and substantial practical value.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have proposed methods to measure and mitigate such biases -- but translating academic theory into practice is inherently challenging. RS practitioners must balance the competing interests of diverse stakeholders, including providers and users, and operate in dynamic environments. Through a semi-structured interview study (N=11), we map the RS practitioner workflow within large technology companies, focusing on how technical teams consider fairness internally and in collaboration with other (legal, data, and fairness) teams. We identify key challenges to incorporating fairness into existing RS workflows: defining fairness in RS contexts, particularly when navigating multi-stakeholder and dynamic fairness considerations. We also identify key organization-wide challenges: making time for fairness work and facilitating cross-team communication. Finally, we offer actionable recommendations for the RS community, including HCI researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

We introduce OBER-an Outcome-Based Educational Recommender that embeds learning outcomes and assessment items directly into the data schema, so any algorithm can be evaluated on the mastery it fosters. OBER uses a minimalist entity-relation model, a log-driven mastery formula, and a plug-in architecture. Integrated into an e-learning system in non-formal domain, it was evaluated trough a two-week randomized split test with over 5 700 learners across three methods: fixed expert trajectory, collaborative filtering (CF), and knowledge-based (KB) filtering. CF maximized retention, but the fixed path achieved the highest mastery. Because OBER derives business, relevance, and learning metrics from the same logs, it lets practitioners weigh relevance and engagement against outcome mastery with no extra testing overhead. The framework is method-agnostic and readily extensible to future adaptive or context-aware recommenders.</p></details> |  |

Accordingly, we generalize existing contribution function principles for set contribution functions and provide a corresponding principle-based analysis. We introduce new principles specific to set-based functions that focus on properties pertaining to the interaction of arguments within a set. Finally, we sketch how the principles play out across different set contribution functions given a recommendation system application scenario.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Real-World Aligned Benchmark for Unlearning in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17076v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern recommender systems heavily leverage user interaction data to deliver personalized experiences. However, relying on personal data presents challenges in adhering to privacy regulations, such as the GDPR's "right to be forgotten". Machine unlearning (MU) aims to address these challenges by enabling the efficient removal of specific training data from models post-training, without compromising model utility or leaving residual information. However, current benchmarks for unlearning in recommender systems -- most notably CURE4Rec -- fail to reflect real-world operational demands. They focus narrowly on collaborative filtering, overlook tasks like session-based and next-basket recommendation, simulate unrealistically large unlearning requests, and ignore critical efficiency constraints. In this paper, we propose a set of design desiderata and research questions to guide the development of a more realistic benchmark for unlearning in recommender systems, with the goal of gathering feedback from the research community. Our benchmark proposal spans multiple recommendation tasks, includes domain-specific unlearning scenarios, and several unlearning algorithms -- including ones adapted from a recent NeurIPS unlearning competition. Furthermore, we argue for an unlearning setup that reflects the sequential, time-sensitive nature of real-world deletion requests. We also present a preliminary experiment in a next-basket recommendation setting based on our proposed desiderata and find that unlearning also works for sequential recommendation models, exposed to many small unlearning requests. In this case, we observe that a modification of a custom-designed unlearning algorithm for recommender systems outperforms general unlearning algorithms significantly, and that unlearning can be executed with a latency of only several seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unified and Adaptive Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering via Graph Signal Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12374v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a foundational approach in recommender systems, but it struggles with challenges such as data sparsity and the cold-start problem. Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has emerged as a promising solution by leveraging dense domains to improve recommendations in sparse target domains. However, existing CDR methods face significant limitations, including their reliance on overlapping users as a bridge between domains and their inability to address domain sensitivity, i.e., differences in user behaviors and characteristics across domains, effectively. To overcome these limitations, we propose CGSP, a unified and adaptive CDR framework based on graph signal processing (GSP). CGSP supports both intra-domain and inter-domain recommendations while adaptively controlling the influence of the source domain through a simple hyperparameter. The framework constructs a cross-domain similarity graph by integrating target-only and source-bridged similarity graphs to capture both intra-domain and inter-domain relationships. This graph is then processed through graph filtering techniques to propagate and enhance local signals. Finally, personalized graph signals are constructed, tailored separately for users in the source and target domains, enabling CGSP to function as a unified framework for CDR scenarios. Extensive evaluation shows that CGSP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse cross-domain settings, with notable gains in low-overlap scenarios, underscoring its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

These systems also serve as components of dialogue, question-answering, and recommender systems. The trajectory of IR has evolved dynamically from its origins in term-based methods to its integration with advanced neural models. While the neural models excel at capturing complex contextual signals and semantic nuances, thereby reshaping the IR landscape, they still face challenges such as data scarcity, interpretability, and the generation of contextually plausible yet potentially inaccurate responses. This evolution requires a combination of both traditional methods (such as term-based sparse retrieval methods with rapid response) and modern neural architectures (such as language models with powerful language understanding capacity). Meanwhile, the emergence of large language models (LLMs), typified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized natural language processing due to their remarkable language understanding, generation, generalization, and reasoning abilities. Consequently, recent research has sought to leverage LLMs to improve IR systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research trajectory, it is necessary to consolidate existing methodologies and provide nuanced insights through a comprehensive overview. In this survey, we delve into the confluence of LLMs and IR systems, including crucial aspects such as query rewriters, retrievers, rerankers, and readers. Additionally, we explore promising directions, such as search agents, within this expanding field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated to version 4; Accepted by ACM TOIS</p></details> |

Motivated by applications in clinical trials and recommendation systems, we assume that two arms are connected if and only if they are similar (i.e., their means are close to each other). We establish a regret lower bound for this problem under the novel feedback structure and introduce two upper confidence bound (UCB)-based algorithms: Double-UCB, which has problem-independent regret upper bounds, and Conservative-UCB, which has problem-dependent upper bounds. Leveraging the similarity structure, we also explore a scenario where the number of arms increases over time (referred to as the \emph{ballooning setting}). Practical applications of this scenario include Q\&A platforms (e.g., Reddit, Stack Overflow, Quora) and product reviews on platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, where answers (or reviews) continuously appear, and the goal is to display the best ones at the top. We extend these two UCB-based algorithms to the ballooning setting. Under mild assumptions, we provide regret upper bounds for both algorithms and discuss their sub-linearity. Furthermore, we propose a new version of the corresponding algorithms that do not rely on prior knowledge of the graph's structural information and provide regret upper bounds. Finally, we conduct experiments to validate the theoretical results.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.11171</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Cold-Start Recommendation via BPE Token-Level Embedding Initialization with LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13179v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems, especially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new users or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as conventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment with shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation strategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by applying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained token-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to using coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can be used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate recommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our mechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over benchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings show that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit Rate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same capability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more interpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The practical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight, but nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the zero-shot setting is indicated within this work.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, the recommender systems community hardly understands, addresses, and evaluates the environmental impact of their work. In this study, we examine the environmental impact of recommender systems research by reproducing typical experimental pipelines. Based on our results, we provide guidelines for researchers and practitioners on how to minimize the environmental footprint of their work and implement green recommender systems - recommender systems designed to minimize their energy consumption and carbon footprint. Our analysis covers 79 papers from the 2013 and 2023 ACM RecSys conferences, comparing traditional "good old-fashioned AI" models with modern deep learning models. We designed and reproduced representative experimental pipelines for both years, measuring energy consumption using a hardware energy meter and converting it into CO2 equivalents. Our results show that papers utilizing deep learning models emit approximately 42 times more CO2 equivalents than papers using traditional models. On average, a single deep learning-based paper generates 2,909 kilograms of CO2 equivalents - more than the carbon emissions of a person flying from New York City to Melbourne or the amount of CO2 sequestered by one tree over 260 years. This work underscores the urgent need for the recommender systems and wider machine learning communities to adopt green AI principles, balancing algorithmic advancements and environmental responsibility to build a sustainable future with AI-powered personalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Just ...</summary><p>Just Accepted at ACM TORS. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2408.08203</p></details> |
| **[A Learnable Fully Interacted Two-Tower Model for Pre-Ranking System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12948v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-ranking plays a crucial role in large-scale recommender systems by significantly improving the efficiency and scalability within the constraints of providing high-quality candidate sets in real time. The two-tower model is widely used in pre-ranking systems due to a good balance between efficiency and effectiveness with decoupled architecture, which independently processes user and item inputs before calculating their interaction (e.g. dot product or similarity measure). However, this independence also leads to the lack of information interaction between the two towers, resulting in less effectiveness. In this paper, a novel architecture named learnable Fully Interacted Two-tower Model (FIT) is proposed, which enables rich information interactions while ensuring inference efficiency. FIT mainly consists of two parts: Meta Query Module (MQM) and Lightweight Similarity Scorer (LSS). Specifically, MQM introduces a learnable item meta matrix to achieve expressive early interaction between user and item features. Moreover, LSS is designed to further obtain effective late interaction between the user and item towers. Finally, experimental results on several public datasets show that our proposed FIT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline pre-ranking models.</p></details> |  |

However, compared to the rapid developments in the AI community, recommendation systems have not achieved a breakthrough in recent years. For instance, they still rely on a multi-stage cascaded architecture rather than an end-to-end approach, leading to computational fragmentation and optimization inconsistencies, and hindering the effective application of key breakthrough technologies from the AI community in recommendation scenarios. To address these issues, we propose OneRec, which reshapes the recommendation system through an end-to-end generative approach and achieves promising results. Firstly, we have enhanced the computational FLOPs of the current recommendation model by 10 $\times$ and have identified the scaling laws for recommendations within certain boundaries. Secondly, reinforcement learning techniques, previously difficult to apply for optimizing recommendations, show significant potential in this framework. Lastly, through infrastructure optimizations, we have achieved 23.7% and 28.8% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) on flagship GPUs during training and inference, respectively, aligning closely with the LLM community. This architecture significantly reduces communication and storage overhead, resulting in operating expense that is only 10.6% of traditional recommendation pipelines. Deployed in Kuaishou/Kuaishou Lite APP, it handles 25% of total queries per second, enhancing overall App Stay Time by 0.54% and 1.24%, respectively. Additionally, we have observed significant increases in metrics such as 7-day Lifetime, which is a crucial indicator of recommendation experience. We also provide practical lessons and insights derived from developing, optimizing, and maintaining a production-scale recommendation system with significant real-world impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed alphabetically by their first name</p></details> |
| **[OneRec-V2 Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20900v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have transformed recommender systems through end-to-end generation. OneRec reformulates recommendation as an autoregressive generation task, achieving high Model FLOPs Utilization. While OneRec-V1 has shown significant empirical success in real-world deployment, two critical challenges hinder its scalability and performance: (1) inefficient computational allocation where 97.66% of resources are consumed by sequence encoding rather than generation, and (2) limitations in reinforcement learning relying solely on reward models. To address these challenges, we propose OneRec-V2, featuring: (1) Lazy Decoder-Only Architecture: Eliminates encoder bottlenecks, reducing total computation by 94% and training resources by 90%, enabling successful scaling to 8B parameters. (2) Preference Alignment with Real-World User Interactions: Incorporates Duration-Aware Reward Shaping and Adaptive Ratio Clipping to better align with user preferences using real-world feedback. Extensive A/B tests on Kuaishou demonstrate OneRec-V2's effectiveness, improving App Stay Time by 0.467%/0.741% while balancing multi-objective recommendations. This work advances generative recommendation scalability and alignment with real-world feedback, representing a step forward in the development of end-to-end recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

However, current neural network-based models often incur significant computational overhead due to the complex training process required to learn and integrate information from multiple modalities. To address this challenge,we propose MultiModal-Graph Filtering (MM-GF), a training-free method grounded in graph filtering (GF) for efficient and accurate multimodal recommendations. Specifically, MM-GF first constructs multiple similarity graphs for two distinct modalities as well as user-item interaction data. Then, MM-GF optimally fuses these multimodal signals using a polynomial graph filter that allows for precise control of the frequency response by adjusting frequency bounds. Furthermore, the filter coefficients are treated as hyperparameters, enabling flexible and data-driven adaptation. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GF not only improves recommendation accuracy by up to 22.25% compared to the best competitor but also dramatically reduces computational costs by achieving the runtime of less than 10 seconds.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high. We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2 and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system comparisons. Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically principled, evaluation framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EARL 25: The 2nd Workshop on Evaluating and Applying Recommender Systems with Large Language Models at RecSys 2025</p></details> |

We report on our experience trying to apply the news recommendation literature to build POPROX, a live platform for news recommendation research, and reflect on the extent to which the current state of research supports system-building efforts. Our experience highlights several unexpected challenges encountered in building personalization features that are commonly found in products from news aggregators and publishers, and shows how those difficulties are connected to surprising gaps in the literature. Finally, we offer a set of lessons learned from building a live system with a persistent user base and highlight opportunities to make future news recommendation research more applicable and impactful in practice.</p></details> |  |

However, despite significant research advances, state-of-the-art VQ methods still face challenges in balancing encoding efficiency and quantization accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VQ method called SAQ. To improve accuracy, SAQ employs a new dimension segmentation technique to strategically partition PCA-projected vectors into segments along their dimensions. By prioritizing leading dimension segments with larger magnitudes, SAQ allocates more bits to high-impact segments, optimizing the use of the available space quota. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed to optimize dimension segmentation and bit allocation, ensuring minimal quantization error. To speed up vector encoding, SAQ devises a code adjustment technique to first quantize each dimension independently and then progressively refine quantized vectors using a coordinate-descent-like approach to avoid exhaustive enumeration. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAQ's superiority over classical methods (e.g., PQ, PCA) and recent state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., LVQ, Extended RabitQ). SAQ achieves up to 80% reduction in quantization error and accelerates encoding speed by over 80x compared to Extended RabitQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, accepted by SIGMOD</p></details> |
| **[AEFS: Adaptive Early Feature Selection for Deep Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12076v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature selection has emerged as a crucial technique in refining recommender systems. Recent advancements leveraging Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has drawn significant attention, particularly in two main categories: early feature selection and late feature selection, differentiated by whether the selection occurs before or after the embedding layer. The early feature selection selects a fixed subset of features and retrains the model, while the late feature selection, known as adaptive feature selection, dynamically adjusts feature choices for each data instance, recognizing the variability in feature significance. Although adaptive feature selection has shown remarkable improvements in performance, its main drawback lies in its post-embedding layer feature selection. This process often becomes cumbersome and inefficient in large-scale recommender systems with billions of ID-type features, leading to a highly sparse and parameter-heavy embedding layer. To overcome this, we introduce Adaptive Early Feature Selection (AEFS), a very simple method that not only adaptively selects informative features for each instance, but also significantly reduces the activated parameters of the embedding layer. AEFS employs a dual-model architecture, encompassing an auxiliary model dedicated to feature selection and a main model responsible for prediction. To ensure effective alignment between these two models, we incorporate two collaborative training loss constraints. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. Notably, AEFS matches the performance of current state-of-theart Adaptive Late Feature Selection methods while achieving a significant reduction of 37. 5% in the activated parameters of the embedding layer. AEFS is open-source at https://github. com/fly-dragon211/AEFS .</p></details> | Accepted by TKDE |

Existing methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item interaction network for further improving social recommendation. To address these issues, we introduce a social \underline{r}ecommendation model with ro\underline{bu}st g\underline{r}aph denoisin\underline{g}-augmentation fusion and multi-s\underline{e}mantic Modeling(Burger). Specifically, we firstly propose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of the model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference, respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling, we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration. Extensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Federated Recommender System with Data Valuation for E-commerce Platform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11196v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) is gaining prominence in machine learning as privacy concerns grow. This paradigm allows each client (e.g., an individual online store) to train a recommendation model locally while sharing only model updates, without exposing the raw interaction logs to a central server, thereby preserving privacy in a decentralized environment. Nonetheless, most existing FL-based recommender systems still rely solely on each client's private data, despite the abundance of publicly available datasets that could be leveraged to enrich local training; this potential remains largely underexplored. To this end, we consider a realistic scenario wherein a large shopping platform collaborates with multiple small online stores to build a global recommender system. The platform possesses global data, such as shareable user and item lists, while each store holds a portion of interaction data privately (or locally). Although integrating global data can help mitigate the limitations of sparse and biased clients' local data, it also introduces additional challenges: simply combining all global interactions can amplify noise and irrelevant patterns, worsening personalization and increasing computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose FedGDVE, which selectively augments each client's local graph with semantically aligned samples from the global dataset. FedGDVE employs: (i) a pre-trained graph encoder to extract global structural features, (ii) a local valid predictor to assess client-specific relevance, (iii) a reinforcement-learning-based probability estimator to filter and sample only the most pertinent global interactions. FedGDVE improves performance by up to 34.86% on recognized benchmarks in FL environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Expert Systems with Applications Journal, Elsevier</p></details> |

To effectively address these issues, we propose a Query-toRecommendation, a parallel recommendation framework that decouples LLMs from candidate pre-selection and instead enables direct retrieval over the entire item pool. Our framework connects LLMs and recommendation models in a parallel manner, allowing each component to independently utilize its strengths without interfering with the other. In this framework, LLMs are utilized to generate feature-enriched item descriptions and personalized user queries, allowing for capturing diverse preferences and enabling rich semantic matching in a zero-shot manner. To effectively combine the complementary strengths of LLM and collaborative signals, we introduce an adaptive reranking strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate an improvement in performance up to 57%, while also improving the novelty and diversity of recommendations.</p></details> |  |

To address the lack of comprehensive assessment frameworks in prior research, we propose a multidimensional analysis that evaluates cocoons through dual perspectives: (1) Individual homogenization via topic diversity (including the number of topic categories and category information entropy) and click repetition; (2) Group polarization via network density and community openness. Through multi-round experiments on real-world datasets, we benchmark seven algorithms and reveal critical insights. Furthermore, we design five lightweight mitigation strategies. This work establishes the first unified metric framework for information cocoons and delivers deployable solutions for ethical recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking User Empowerment in AI Recommender Systems: Designing through Transparency and Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11098v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart recommendation algorithms have revolutionized content delivery and improved efficiency across various domains. However, concerns about user agency persist due to their inherent opacity (information asymmetry) and one-way influence (power asymmetry). This study introduces a provotype designed to enhance user agency by providing actionable transparency and control over data management and content delivery. We conducted qualitative interviews with 19 participants to explore their preferences and concerns regarding the features, as well as the provotype's impact on users' understanding and trust toward recommender systems. Findings underscore the importance of integrating transparency with control, and reaffirm users' desire for agency and the ability to actively intervene in personalization. We also discuss insights for encouraging adoption and awareness of such agency-enhancing features. Overall, this study contributes novel approaches and applicable insights, laying the groundwork for designing more user-centered recommender systems that foreground user autonomy and fairness in AI-driven content delivery.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |
| **[SPARK: Adaptive Low-Rank Knowledge Graph Modeling in Hybrid Geometric Spaces for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11094v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enhance recommender systems but face challenges from inherent noise, sparsity, and Euclidean geometry's inadequacy for complex relational structures, critically impairing representation learning, especially for long-tail entities. Existing methods also often lack adaptive multi-source signal fusion tailored to item popularity. This paper introduces SPARK, a novel multi-stage framework systematically tackling these issues. SPARK first employs Tucker low-rank decomposition to denoise KGs and generate robust entity representations. Subsequently, an SVD-initialized hybrid geometric GNN concurrently learns representations in Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces; the latter is strategically leveraged for its aptitude in modeling hierarchical structures, effectively capturing semantic features of sparse, long-tail items. A core contribution is an item popularity-aware adaptive fusion strategy that dynamically weights signals from collaborative filtering, refined KG embeddings, and diverse geometric spaces for precise modeling of both mainstream and long-tail items. Finally, contrastive learning aligns these multi-source representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPARK's significant superiority over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in improving long-tail item recommendation, offering a robust, principled approach to knowledge-enhanced recommendation. Implementation code is available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/SPARK.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM' 25 |

However, recent studies have shown that RecSys are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether user interaction record was used to train a target model or not. MIAs on RecSys models can directly lead to a privacy breach. For example, via identifying the fact that a purchase record that has been used to train a RecSys associated with a specific user, an attacker can infer that user's special quirks. In recent years, MIAs have been shown to be effective on other ML tasks, e.g., classification models and natural language processing. However, traditional MIAs are ill-suited for RecSys due to the unseen posterior probability. Although MIAs on RecSys form a newly emerging and rapidly growing research area, there has been no systematic survey on this topic yet. In this article, we conduct the first comprehensive survey on RecSys MIAs. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in RecSys MIAs, exploring the design principles, challenges, attack and defense associated with this emerging field. We provide a unified taxonomy that categorizes different RecSys MIAs based on their characterizations and discuss their pros and cons. Based on the limitations and gaps identified in this survey, we point out several promising future research directions to inspire the researchers who wish to follow this area. This survey not only serves as a reference for the research community but also provides a clear description for researchers outside this research domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[RecoWorld: Building Simulated Environments for Agentic Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10397v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RecoWorld, a blueprint for building simulated environments tailored to agentic recommender systems. Such environments give agents a proper training space where they can learn from errors without impacting real users. RecoWorld distinguishes itself with a dual-view architecture: a simulated user and an agentic recommender engage in multi-turn interactions aimed at maximizing user retention. The user simulator reviews recommended items, updates its mindset, and when sensing potential user disengagement, generates reflective instructions. The agentic recommender adapts its recommendations by incorporating these user instructions and reasoning traces, creating a dynamic feedback loop that actively engages users. This process leverages the exceptional reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs. We explore diverse content representations within the simulator, including text-based, multimodal, and semantic ID modeling, and discuss how multi-turn RL enables the recommender to refine its strategies through iterative interactions. RecoWorld also supports multi-agent simulations, allowing creators to simulate the responses of targeted user populations. It marks an important first step toward recommender systems where users and agents collaboratively shape personalized information streams. We envision new interaction paradigms where "user instructs, recommender responds," jointly optimizing user retention and engagement.</p></details> |  |

We rely on a well-known quality-diversity decomposition of the similarity kernel to give more weight to user preferences.

However, accurately predicting key thermophysical properties remains challenging due to the vast chemical design space and the limited availability of experimental data. In this study, we present a data-driven transfer learning framework that leverages a neural recommender system (NRS) to enable reliable property prediction for ILs using sparse experimental datasets. The approach involves a two-stage process: first, pre-training NRS models on COSMO-RS-based simulated data at fixed temperature and pressure to learn property-specific structural embeddings for cations and anions; and second, fine-tuning simple feedforward neural networks using these embeddings with experimental data at varying temperatures and pressures. In this work, five essential IL properties are considered: density, viscosity, surface tension, heat capacity, and melting point. The framework supports both within-property and cross-property knowledge transfer. Notably, pre-trained models for density, viscosity, and heat capacity are used to fine-tune models for all five target properties, achieving improved performance by a substantial margin for four of them. The model exhibits robust extrapolation to previously unseen ILs. Moreover, the final trained models enable property prediction for over 700,000 IL combinations, offering a scalable solution for IL screening in process design. This work highlights the effectiveness of combining simulated data and transfer learning to overcome sparsity in the experimental data.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods frequently reduce the interpretability and transparency of the system. In this research, we develop a systematic application, adaptation, and evaluation of deletion diagnostics in the recommender setting. The method compares the performance of a model to that of a similar model trained without a specific user or item, allowing us to quantify how that observation influences the recommender, either positively or negatively. To demonstrate its model-agnostic nature, the proposal is applied to both Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), a widely used deep learning-based recommender, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a classical collaborative filtering technique. Experiments on the MovieLens and Amazon Reviews datasets provide insights into model behavior and highlight the generality of the approach across different recommendation paradigms.</p></details> |  |

While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt these models, studies often prioritize parameter efficiency, neglecting GPU memory and training speed. To address this, we introduced the IISAN framework, significantly enhancing efficiency. However, IISAN was limited to symmetrical MFMs and identical text and image encoders, preventing the use of state-of-the-art Large Language Models. To overcome this, we developed IISAN-Versa, a versatile plug-and-play architecture compatible with both symmetrical and asymmetrical MFMs. IISAN-Versa employs a Decoupled PEFT structure and utilizes both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. It effectively handles asymmetry through a simple yet effective combination of group layer-dropping and dimension transformation alignment. Our research demonstrates that IISAN-Versa effectively adapts large text encoders, and we further identify a scaling effect where larger encoders generally perform better. IISAN-Versa also demonstrates strong versatility in our defined multimodal scenarios, which include raw titles and captions generated from images and videos. Additionally, IISAN-Versa achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Microlens public benchmark. We release our code at https://github.com/GAIR-Lab/IISAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)</p></details> |

Despite its effectiveness, this study uncovers that LLM empowered recommender systems are vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose both system and user privacy. To examine this threat, we present the first systematic study on inversion attacks targeting LLM empowered recommender systems, where adversaries attempt to reconstruct original prompts that contain personal preferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes by exploiting the output logits of recommendation models. We reproduce the vec2text framework and optimize it using our proposed method called Similarity Guided Refinement, enabling more accurate reconstruction of textual prompts from model generated logits. Extensive experiments across two domains (movies and books) and two representative LLM based recommendation models demonstrate that our method achieves high fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we can recover nearly 65 percent of the user interacted items and correctly infer age and gender in 87 percent of the cases. The experiments also reveal that privacy leakage is largely insensitive to the victim model's performance but highly dependent on domain consistency and prompt complexity. These findings expose critical privacy vulnerabilities in LLM empowered recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM RecSys 2025 (10 pages, 4 figures)</p></details> |

In this study, we examine to what extent Twitter's content recommender, in conjunction with a user's social network, impacts the topic, political skew, and reliability of information served on the platform during a high-stakes election. We utilize automated accounts to document Twitter's algorithmically curated and reverse chronological timelines throughout the U.S. 2022 midterm election. We find that the algorithmic timeline measurably influences exposure to election content, partisan skew, and the prevalence of low-quality information and election rumors. Critically, these impacts are mediated by the partisan makeup of one's personal social network, which often exerts greater influence than the algorithm alone. We find that the algorithmic feed decreases the proportion of election content shown to left-leaning accounts, and that it skews content toward right-leaning sources when compared to the reverse chronological feed. We additionally find evidence that the algorithmic system increases the prevalence of election-related rumors for right-leaning accounts, and has mixed effects on the prevalence of low-quality information sources. Our work provides insight into the outcomes of Twitter's complex recommender system at a crucial time period before controversial changes to the platform and in the midst of nationwide elections and highlights the need for ongoing study of algorithmic systems and their role in democratic processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) 2026</p></details> |

The emergence of heterogeneous information, such as user profile and behavior sequences, depicts user interests from different aspects. A mutually beneficial integration of heterogeneous information is the cornerstone towards the success of CTR prediction. However, most of the existing methods suffer from two fundamental limitations, including (1) insufficient inter-mode interaction due to the unidirectional information flow between modes, and (2) aggressive information aggregation caused by early summarization, resulting in excessive information loss. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel module named InterFormer to learn heterogeneous information interaction in an interleaving style. To achieve better interaction learning, InterFormer enables bidirectional information flow for mutually beneficial learning across different modes. To avoid aggressive information aggregation, we retain complete information in each data mode and use a separate bridging arch for effective information selection and summarization. Our proposed InterFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[DeepVoting: Learning and Fine-Tuning Voting Rules with Canonical Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13630v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aggregating agent preferences into a collective decision is an important step in many problems (e.g., hiring, elections, peer review) and across areas of computer science (e.g., reinforcement learning, recommender systems). As Social Choice Theory has shown, the problem of designing aggregation rules with specific sets of properties (axioms) can be difficult, or provably impossible in some cases. Instead of designing algorithms by hand, one can learn aggregation rules, particularly voting rules, from data. However, prior work in this area has required extremely large models or been limited by the choice of preference representation, i.e., embedding. We recast the problem of designing voting rules with desirable properties into one of learning probabilistic functions that output distributions over a set of candidates. Specifically, we use neural networks to learn probabilistic social choice functions. Using standard embeddings from the social choice literature we show that preference profile encoding has significant impact on the efficiency and ability of neural networks to learn rules, allowing us to learn rules faster and with smaller networks than previous work. Moreover, we show that our learned rules can be fine-tuned using axiomatic properties to create novel voting rules and make them resistant to specific types of "attack". Namely, we fine-tune rules to resist a probabilistic version of the No Show Paradox.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Explainable Job Title Matching: Leveraging Semantic Textual Relatedness and Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09522v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions: low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and contextual matching are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stratified Expert Cloning for Retention-Aware Recommendation at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05628v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User retention is critical in large-scale recommender systems, significantly influencing online platforms' long-term success. Existing methods typically focus on short-term engagement, neglecting the evolving dynamics of user behaviors over time. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods, though promising for optimizing long-term rewards, face challenges like delayed credit assignment and sample inefficiency. We introduce Stratified Expert Cloning (SEC), an imitation learning framework that leverages abundant interaction data from high-retention users to learn robust policies. SEC incorporates: 1) multi-level expert stratification to model diverse retention behaviors; 2) adaptive expert selection to dynamically match users with appropriate policies based on their state and retention history; and 3) action entropy regularization to enhance recommendation diversity and policy generalization. Extensive offline evaluations and online A/B tests on major video platforms (Kuaishou and Kuaishou Lite) with hundreds of millions of users validate SEC's effectiveness. Results show substantial improvements, achieving cumulative lifts of 0.098 percent and 0.122 percent in active days on the two platforms respectively, each translating into over 200,000 additional daily active users.</p></details> | CIKM Accepted |

His critique, rooted in statistical misinterpretation and methodological shortcuts, remains as relevant today as it was then. But rather than correcting course, we added new layers of sophistication on top of the same broken foundations. This paper revisits Amatriain's diagnosis and argues that many of the conceptual, epistemological, and infrastructural failures he identified still persist, in more subtle or systemic forms. Drawing on recent work in reproducibility, evaluation methodology, environmental impact, and participatory design, we showcase how the field's accelerating complexity has outpaced its introspection. We highlight ongoing community-led initiatives that attempt to shift the paradigm, including workshops, evaluation frameworks, and calls for value-sensitive and participatory research. At the same time, we contend that meaningful change will require not only new metrics or better tooling, but a fundamental reframing of what recommender systems research is for, who it serves, and how knowledge is produced and validated. Our call is not just for technical reform, but for a recommender systems research agenda grounded in epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the work.

However, existing SRS methods often rely on collaborative filtering signals and fail to capture real-time user preferences, while Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS) excel at eliciting immediate interests through natural language interactions but neglect historical behavior. To bridge this gap, we propose CESRec, a novel framework that integrates the long-term preference modeling of SRS with the real-time preference elicitation of CRS. We introduce semantic-based pseudo interaction construction, which dynamically updates users'historical interaction sequences by analyzing conversational feedback, generating a pseudo-interaction sequence that seamlessly combines long-term and real-time preferences. Additionally, we reduce the impact of outliers in historical items that deviate from users'core preferences by proposing dual alignment outlier items masking, which identifies and masks such items using semantic-collaborative aligned representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CESRec achieves state-of-the-art performance by boosting strong SRS models, validating its effectiveness in integrating conversational feedback into SRS.</p></details> |  |

Transferring such technologies from academia to industry presents challenges related to trustworthiness, legacy systems, limited digital literacy, and the gap between academic and industrial expertise. For deep learning in particular, performance and integration into existing workflows are additional concerns. In this work, we first evaluate the performance of CodeBERT for detecting vulnerable functions in industrial and open-source software. We analyse its cross-domain generalisation when fine-tuned on open-source data and tested on industrial data, and vice versa, also exploring strategies for handling class imbalance. Based on these results, we develop AI-DO(Automating vulnerability detection Integration for Developers' Operations), a Continuous Integration-Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)-integrated recommender system that uses fine-tuned CodeBERT to detect and localise vulnerabilities during code review without disrupting workflows. Finally, we assess the tool's perceived usefulness through a survey with the company's IT professionals. Our results show that models trained on industrial data detect vulnerabilities accurately within the same domain but lose performance on open-source code, while a deep learner fine-tuned on open data, with appropriate undersampling techniques, improves the detection of vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 26th International Conference on Product-Focused Software Process Improvement (PROFES 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Constructing a Question-Answering Simulator through the Distillation of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09226v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students, thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation: (1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task and the knowledge tracing (KT) task. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LDSim-05A9.</p></details> |  |

Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional retrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic generation. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained by their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from two critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking a coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement (i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity. To overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that learns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core innovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization process that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more uniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict hierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for each recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE incorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space overlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but also promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive utilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled IDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks validate HiD-VAE's superior performance against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HiD-VAE-84B2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modality Alignment with Multi-scale Bilateral Attention for Multimodal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09114v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation systems are increasingly becoming foundational technologies for e-commerce and content platforms, enabling personalized services by jointly modeling users' historical behaviors and the multimodal features of items (e.g., visual and textual). However, most existing methods rely on either static fusion strategies or graph-based local interaction modeling, facing two critical limitations: (1) insufficient ability to model fine-grained cross-modal associations, leading to suboptimal fusion quality; and (2) a lack of global distribution-level consistency, causing representational bias. To address these, we propose MambaRec, a novel framework that integrates local feature alignment and global distribution regularization via attention-guided learning. At its core, we introduce the Dilated Refinement Attention Module (DREAM), which uses multi-scale dilated convolutions with channel-wise and spatial attention to align fine-grained semantic patterns between visual and textual modalities. This module captures hierarchical relationships and context-aware associations, improving cross-modal semantic modeling. Additionally, we apply Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and contrastive loss functions to constrain global modality alignment, enhancing semantic consistency. This dual regularization reduces mode-specific deviations and boosts robustness. To improve scalability, MambaRec employs a dimensionality reduction strategy to lower the computational cost of high-dimensional multimodal features. Extensive experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets show that MambaRec outperforms existing methods in fusion quality, generalization, and efficiency. Our code has been made publicly available at https://github.com/rkl71/MambaRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\ R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set, and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2, GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity. Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in LLM-based pipelines.</p></details> |  |

However, recommender systems can very well be used continuously for extended time. Similarly so, user behavior may evolve over that extended time. Although media studies and psychology offer a wealth of research on the evolution of user preferences and behavior as individuals age, there has been scant research in this regard within the realm of user modeling and recommender systems. In this study, we investigate the evolution of user preferences and behavior using the LFM-2b dataset, which, to our knowledge, is the only dataset that encompasses a sufficiently extensive time frame to permit real longitudinal studies and includes age information about its users. We identify specific usage and taste preferences directly related to the age of the user, i.e., while younger users tend to listen broadly to contemporary popular music, older users have more elaborate and personalized listening habits. The findings yield important insights that open new directions for research in recommender systems, providing guidance for future efforts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to UMAP 2025</p></details> |

While recent zero-shot methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to address this, they often struggle with sparse metadata and hallucinated or incomplete knowledge. We propose ColdRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation approach that builds a domain-specific knowledge graph dynamically to enhance LLM-based recommendation in cold-start scenarios, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. ColdRAG begins by converting structured item attributes into rich natural-language profiles, from which it extracts entities and relationships to construct a unified knowledge graph capturing item semantics. Given a user's interaction history, it scores edges in the graph using an LLM, retrieves candidate items with supporting evidence, and prompts the LLM to rank them. By enabling multi-hop reasoning over this graph, ColdRAG grounds recommendations in verifiable evidence, reducing hallucinations and strengthening semantic connections. Experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that ColdRAG surpasses existing zero-shot baselines in both Recall and NDCG. This framework offers a practical solution to cold-start recommendation by combining knowledge-graph reasoning with retrieval-augmented LLM generation.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of each possible rating.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |
| **[Generalized Tensor Completion with Non-Random Missingness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06225v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor completion plays a crucial role in applications such as recommender systems and medical imaging, where data are often highly incomplete. While extensive prior work has addressed tensor completion with data missingness, most assume that each entry of the tensor is available independently with probability $p$. However, real-world tensor data often exhibit missing-not-at-random (MNAR) patterns, where the probability of missingness depends on the underlying tensor values. This paper introduces a generalized tensor completion framework for noisy data with MNAR, where the observation probability is modeled as a function of underlying tensor values. Our flexible framework accommodates various tensor data types, such as continuous, binary and count data. For model estimation, we develop an alternating maximization algorithm and derive non-asymptotic error bounds for the estimator at each iteration, under considerably relaxed conditions on the observation probabilities. Additionally, we propose a statistical inference procedure to test whether observation probabilities depend on underlying tensor values, offering a formal assessment of the missingness assumption within our modeling framework. The utility and efficacy of our approach are demonstrated through comparative simulation studies and analyses of two real-world datasets.</p></details> | 31 pages |

To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer Type-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates consumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type theory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and expert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs. satisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction histories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user types in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate user types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that dynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query complexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like strategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book, and Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces interaction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that both consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance gains. These results demonstrate that CT-CRS offers a scalable and interpretable solution for enhancing CRS personalization through the integration of psychological modeling and advanced policy optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The tables Recommendation strategies for different consumer types need to be modified.

This limits their applicability in dynamic environments where user preferences evolve. Incremental learning offers a promising solution, yet conventional methods from computer vision or NLP face challenges in recommendation tasks due to data sparsity and distinct task paradigms. Existing approaches for neural recommenders remain limited and often lack generalizability. To address this, we propose MEGG, Replay Samples with Maximally Extreme GGscore, an experience replay based incremental learning framework. MEGG introduces GGscore, a novel metric that quantifies sample influence, enabling the selective replay of highly influential samples to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Being model-agnostic, MEGG integrates seamlessly across architectures and frameworks. Experiments on three neural models and four benchmark datasets show superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, with strong scalability, efficiency, and robustness. Implementation will be released publicly upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (DMKD) in Sep 2025</p></details> |

However, there is growing concern about the adverse effects of these systems, including their potential tendency to expose users to sensitive or harmful material, negatively impacting overall well-being. To address this concern quantitatively, it is necessary to create datasets with relevant sensitivity labels for content, enabling researchers to evaluate personalized systems beyond mere engagement metrics. To this end, we introduce two novel datasets that include a taxonomy of sensitivity labels alongside user-content ratings: one that integrates MovieLens rating data with content warnings from the Does the Dog Die? community ratings website, and another that combines fan-fiction interaction data and user-generated warnings from Archive of Our Own.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compa...</summary><p>Companion Proceedings of the ACM on Web Conference 2025, 2025</p></details> |

Instead of retraining models or relying on opaque heuristics, our method restructures a user's Personalized Knowledge Graph (PKG) to suppress feature co-occurrence patterns that reinforce Personalized Information Environments (PIEs), i.e., algorithmically induced filter bubbles that constrain content diversity. These adapted PKGs are used to construct structured prompts that steer the language model toward more diverse, Out-PIE recommendations while preserving topical relevance. We introduce a family of symbolic adaptation strategies, including soft reweighting, hard inversion, and targeted removal of biased triples, and a client-side learning algorithm that optimizes their application per user. Experiments on a recipe recommendation benchmark show that personalized PKG adaptations significantly increase content novelty while maintaining recommendation quality, outperforming global adaptation and naive prompt-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, ISWC</p></details> |

Reducing content visibility, aka shadow banning, may help limit harmful content; however, it can also be used to suppress dissenting voices. This prompts the need for greater transparency and a better understanding of this practice. In this paper, we investigate the presence of visibility alterations through a large-scale quantitative analysis of two Twitter/X datasets comprising over 40 million tweets from more than 9 million users, focused on discussions surrounding the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the 2024 US Presidential Elections. We use view counts to detect patterns of reduced or inflated visibility and examine how these correlate with user opinions, social roles, and narrative framings. Our analysis shows that the algorithm systematically penalizes tweets containing links to external resources, reducing their visibility by up to a factor of eight, regardless of the ideological stance or source reliability. Rather, content visibility may be penalized or favored depending on the specific accounts producing it, as observed when comparing tweets from the Kyiv Independent and RT.com or tweets by Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Overall, our work highlights the importance of transparency in content moderation and recommendation systems to protect the integrity of public discourse and ensure equitable access to online platforms.</p></details> |  |

Thus, transparency and responsible adoption in Human Resource Management (HRM) are critical. This study examines how HR managers' AI literacy influences their subjective perception and objective understanding of explainable AI (XAI) elements in recruiting recommender dashboards. In an online experiment, 410 German-based HR managers compared baseline dashboards to versions enriched with three XAI styles: important features, counterfactuals, and model criteria. Our results show that the dashboards used in practice do not explain AI results and even keep AI elements opaque. However, while adding XAI features improves subjective perceptions of helpfulness and trust among users with moderate or high AI literacy, it does not increase their objective understanding. It may even reduce accurate understanding, especially with complex explanations. Only overlays of important features significantly aided the interpretations of high-literacy users. Our findings highlight that the benefits of XAI in recruitment depend on users' AI literacy, emphasizing the need for tailored explanation strategies and targeted literacy training in HRM to ensure fair, transparent, and effective adoption of AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper for RecSys in HR'25: The 5th Workshop on Recommender Systems for Human Resources, in conjunction with the 19th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, September 22--26, 2025, Prague, Czech Republic</p></details> |

This issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine, ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook Representations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for improved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings from app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns discrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel -- unlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables independent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better modeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative signals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item levels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a dual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to capture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a large-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong baselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps. Online A/B testing further validates our approach, showing a +10.52% lift in CTR and a +16.30% improvement in CVR, demonstrating PCR-CA's effectiveness in real-world deployment. The new framework has now been fully deployed on the Microsoft Store.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |

We address this challenge by modeling the breadth of user interest via the entropy of retrieval score distributions. Our method uses a neural retriever to fetch relevant items for a user query and computes the entropy of the re-ranked scores to dynamically route the dialogue policy: low-entropy (specific) queries trigger direct recommendations, whereas high-entropy (ambiguous) queries prompt exploratory questions. This simple yet effective strategy allows an LLM-driven agent to remain aware of an arbitrarily large catalog in real-time without bloating its context window.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformalized Tensor Completion with Riemannian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00581v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor data, or multi-dimensional arrays, is a data format popular in multiple fields such as social network analysis, recommender systems, and brain imaging. It is not uncommon to observe tensor data containing missing values, and tensor completion aims at estimating the missing values given the partially observed tensor. Sufficient efforts have been spared on devising scalable tensor completion algorithms, but few on quantifying the uncertainty of the estimator. In this paper, we nest the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of tensor completion under a split conformal prediction framework and establish the connection of the UQ problem to a problem of estimating the missing propensity of each tensor entry. We model the data missingness of the tensor with a tensor Ising model parameterized by a low-rank tensor parameter. We propose to estimate the tensor parameter by maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation (MPLE) with a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted to justify the validity of the resulting conformal interval. We apply our method to the regional total electron content (TEC) reconstruction problem. Supplemental materials of the paper are available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARIES: Relation Assessment and Model Recommendation for Deep Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06060v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning models for time series forecasting have been significant. These models often leverage fundamental time series properties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an intrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing benchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns, restricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there is no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost expenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream applications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing relation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for recommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we construct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a comprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct an extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the relationship between time series properties and modeling strategies. Our experimental results reveal a clear correlation. Based on these findings, we propose the first deep forecasting model recommender, capable of providing interpretable suggestions for real-world time series. In summary, ARIES is the first study to establish the relations between the properties of time series data and modeling strategies, while also implementing a model recommendation system.

| **[A Survey of Real-World Recommender Systems: Challenges, Constraints, and Industrial Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06002v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have generated tremendous value for both users and businesses, drawing significant attention from academia and industry alike. However, due to practical constraints, academic research remains largely confined to offline dataset optimizations, lacking access to real user data and large-scale recommendation platforms. This limitation reduces practical relevance, slows technological progress, and hampers a full understanding of the key challenges in recommender systems. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of industrial recommender systems and contrast them with their academic counterparts. We highlight key differences in data scale, real-time requirements, and evaluation methodologies, and we summarize major real-world recommendation scenarios along with their associated challenges. We then examine how industry practitioners address these challenges in Transaction-Oriented Recommender Systems and Content-Oriented Recommender Systems, a new classification grounded in item characteristics and recommendation objectives. Finally, we outline promising research directions, including the often-overlooked role of user decision-making, the integration of economic and psychological theories, and concrete suggestions for advancing academic research. Our goal is to enhance academia's understanding of practical recommender systems, bridge the growing development gap, and foster stronger collaboration between industry and academia.</p></details> | Working paper |
| **[RecPS: Privacy Risk Scoring for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18365v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RecSys) have become an essential component of many web applications. The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus, quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM RecSys 2025; to appear</p></details> |

It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs perform well in rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining. We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of 2nd Workshop on Evaluating and Applying Recommendation Systems with Large Language Models (EARL) at RecSys 2025 (EARL 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Ranking Utility Tuning in the Ad Recommender System at Pinterest](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05292v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the learned policy model.</p></details> |  |

| **[Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning for Gene Regulatory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17786v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a powerful self-supervised learning framework that performs data augmentation through graph perturbations, with growing applications in the analysis of biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). The artificial perturbations commonly used in GCL, such as node dropping, induce structural changes that can diverge from biological reality. This concern has contributed to a broader trend in graph representation learning toward augmentation-free methods, which view such structural changes as problematic and to be avoided. However, this trend overlooks the fundamental insight that structural changes from biologically meaningful perturbations are not a problem to be avoided but a rich source of information, thereby ignoring the valuable opportunity to leverage data from real biological experiments. Motivated by this insight, we propose SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a new GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations from gene knockdown experiments as supervision. SupGCL is a probabilistic formulation that continuously generalizes conventional GCL, linking artificial augmentations with real perturbations measured in knockdown experiments and using the latter as explicit supervisory signals. To assess effectiveness, we train GRN representations with SupGCL and evaluate their performance on downstream tasks. The evaluation includes both node-level tasks, such as gene function classification, and graph-level tasks on patient-specific GRNs, such as patient survival hazard prediction. Across 13 tasks built from GRN datasets derived from patients with three cancer types, SupGCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | under review |
| **[SlideMamba: Entropy-Based Adaptive Fusion of GNN and Mamba for Enhanced Representation Learning in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21239v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied Representation Alignment with Mirror Neurons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21136v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected. Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay, treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align. Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space, where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[UniTransfer: Video Concept Transfer via Progressive Spatial and Timestep Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21086v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual fidelity and editability.

Despite their growing importance in chemoinformatics, the effectiveness of molecular representation learning has been hindered by limitations in existing small molecule datasets. To address this gap, we present MolPILE, large-scale, diverse, and rigorously curated collection of 222 million compounds, constructed from 6 large-scale databases using an automated curation pipeline. We present a comprehensive analysis of current pretraining datasets, highlighting considerable shortcomings for training ML models, and demonstrate how retraining existing models on MolPILE yields improvements in generalization performance. This work provides a standardized resource for model training, addressing the pressing need for an ImageNet-like dataset in molecular chemistry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alignment Unlocks Complementarity: A Framework for Multiview Circuit Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20968v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich, complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow Matching in the Low-Noise Regime: Pathologies and a Contrastive Remedy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20952v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero, arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions, thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology, establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF), a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive Coding-based Deep Neural Network Fine-tuning for Computationally Efficient Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20269v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As deep neural networks are increasingly deployed in dynamic, real-world environments, relying on a single static model is often insufficient. Changes in input data distributions caused by sensor drift or lighting variations necessitate continual model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid training methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by combining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method begins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to achieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed for online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to shifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness of Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational efficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic accelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a reduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining model performance in dynamic environments.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

Previous research found that poor representations and biased classifiers are the main problems and proposed neural-collapse-inspired synthetic simplex ETF to help representations be closer to neural collapse optima. However, we find that the neural-collapse-inspired methods are not strong enough to reach neural collapse and still have huge gaps to centralized training. In this paper, we rethink this issue from a self-bootstrap perspective and propose FedYoYo (You Are Your Own Best Teacher), introducing Augmented Self-bootstrap Distillation (ASD) to improve representation learning by distilling knowledge between weakly and strongly augmented local samples, without needing extra datasets or models. We further introduce Distribution-aware Logit Adjustment (DLA) to balance the self-bootstrap process and correct biased feature representations. FedYoYo nearly eliminates the performance gap, achieving centralized-level performance even under mixed heterogeneity. It enhances local representation learning, reducing model drift and improving convergence, with feature prototypes closer to neural collapse optimality. Extensive experiments show FedYoYo achieves state-of-the-art results, even surpassing centralized logit adjustment methods by 5.4\% under global long-tailed settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniHR: Hierarchical Representation Learning for Unified Knowledge Graph Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07019v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world knowledge graphs (KGs) contain not only standard triple-based facts, but also more complex, heterogeneous types of facts, such as hyper-relational facts with auxiliary key-value pairs, temporal facts with additional timestamps, and nested facts that imply relationships between facts. These richer forms of representation have attracted significant attention due to their enhanced expressiveness and capacity to model complex semantics in real-world scenarios. However, most existing studies suffer from two main limitations: (1) they typically focus on modeling only specific types of facts, thus making it difficult to generalize to real-world scenarios with multiple fact types; and (2) they struggle to achieve generalizable hierarchical (inter-fact and intra-fact) modeling due to the complexity of these representations. To overcome these limitations, we propose UniHR, a Unified Hierarchical Representation learning framework, which consists of a learning-optimized Hierarchical Data Representation (HiDR) module and a unified Hierarchical Structure Learning (HiSL) module. The HiDR module unifies hyper-relational KGs, temporal KGs, and nested factual KGs into triple-based representations. Then HiSL incorporates intra-fact and inter-fact message passing, focusing on enhancing both semantic information within individual facts and enriching the structural information between facts. To go beyond the unified method itself, we further explore the potential of unified representation in complex real-world scenarios, including joint modeling of multi-task, compositional and hybrid facts. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets across 5 types of KGs demonstrate the effectiveness of UniHR and highlight the strong potential of unified representations.</p></details> |  |

From inverse problems to numerical PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and (iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 22 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot, cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings. Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and 73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in low-resource contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Conference on Big Data 2025</p></details> |

Graph SSL is particularly useful in scenarios with limited or no labeled data. Existing SSL methods predominantly follow contrastive or generative paradigms, each excelling in different tasks: contrastive methods typically perform well on classification tasks, while generative methods often excel in link prediction. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for graph SSL that integrates the strengths of both approaches. Our framework introduces community-aware node-level contrastive learning, providing more robust and effective positive and negative node pairs generation, alongside graph-level contrastive learning to capture global semantic information. Additionally, we employ a comprehensive augmentation strategy that combines feature masking, node perturbation, and edge perturbation, enabling robust and diverse representation learning. By incorporating these enhancements, our model achieves superior performance across multiple tasks, including node classification, clustering, and link prediction. Evaluations on open benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a performance lift of 0.23%-2.01% depending on the task and dataset.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Beyond Visual Similarity: Rule-Guided Multimodal Clustering with explicit domain rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20501v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models, highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for complex, knowledge intensive settings.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Offline Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Quasimetric Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20478v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn "successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric) distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a **quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments. This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on quasimetric networks struggle.</p></details> |  |
| **[FORGE: Foundational Optimization Representations from Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20330v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Still, learning-based approaches to accelerate combinatorial optimization often require solving a large number of difficult instances to collect training data, incurring significant computational cost. Existing learning-based methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution, for each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization. We introduce Forge: Foundational Optimization Representations from Graph Embeddings, a framework that pre-trains a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on a large, diverse collection of mixed-integer programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised manner, without relying on optimization solvers or optimal solutions. Vector quantization produces discrete code assignments that serve as a vocabulary for representing optimization instances. We evaluate Forge in both unsupervised and supervised settings. In the unsupervised setting, Forge embeddings effectively cluster unseen instances across problem domains and sizes. In the supervised setting, we fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single pre-trained model helps predicting both the integrality gap for cut-generation and variable hints for search guidance across multiple problem and size distributions. In both tasks, we improve the performance of a commercial optimization solver and outperform state-of-the-art learning-based methods. Finally, we open-source our training code, pre-trained Forge weights, and embeddings for multiple MIP distributions to foster further research in representation learning for optimization problems.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of seven discriminative self-supervised models and one supervised model across diverse tasks, including ImageNet classification, transfer learning, segmentation, and detection. Our findings suggest that discriminative SSL models generally exhibit better robustness to adversarial attacks compared to their supervised counterpart on ImageNet, with this advantage extending to transfer learning when using linear evaluation. However, when fine-tuning is applied, the robustness gap between SSL and supervised models narrows considerably. Similarly, this robustness advantage diminishes in segmentation and detection tasks. We also investigate how various factors might influence adversarial robustness, including architectural choices, training duration, data augmentations, and batch sizes. Our analysis contributes to the ongoing exploration of adversarial robustness in visual self-supervised representation systems.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

However, data collected from a realistic scene usually has a non-Euclidean structure, evaluating the consistency of latent representations from paired views using Euclidean distance raises challenges. To address this issue, a novel SPD (symmetric positive definite) manifold learning is proposed for multi-modal image fusion, named SMLNet, which extends the image fusion approach from the Euclidean space to the SPD manifolds. Specifically, we encode images according to the Riemannian geometry to exploit their intrinsic statistical correlations, thereby aligning with human visual perception. The SPD matrix fundamentally underpins our network's learning process. Building upon this mathematical foundation, we employ a cross-modal fusion strategy to exploit modality-specific dependencies and augment complementary information. To capture semantic similarity in images' intrinsic space, we further develop an attention module that meticulously processes the cross-modal semantic affinity matrix. Based on this, we design an end-to-end fusion network based on cross-modal manifold learning.

Within this context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-Augmented Contrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models and supervised contrastive learning. The DACL framework operates on a latent space created by a lightweight Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on our novel Scattering Transformer (ST) features [12]. It utilizes the diffusion forward process as a principled data augmentation technique to generate multiple noisy views of these latent embeddings. A U-Net style encoder is then trained with a supervised contrastive objective to learn a representation that balances class discrimination with robustness to noise across various diffusion time steps. We evaluated this proof-of-concept method on the PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset, achieving a competitive AUROC of 0.7815. This work establishes a new paradigm for representation learning by using the diffusion process itself to drive the contrastive objective, creating noise-invariant embeddings that demonstrate a strong foundation for class separability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal-enhanced Federated Recommendation: A Group-wise Fusion Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19955v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Recommendation (FR) is a new learning paradigm to tackle the learn-to-rank problem in a privacy-preservation manner. How to integrate multi-modality features into federated recommendation is still an open challenge in terms of efficiency, distribution heterogeneity, and fine-grained alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal fusion mechanism in federated recommendation settings (GFMFR). Specifically, it offloads multimodal representation learning to the server, which stores item content and employs a high-capacity encoder to generate expressive representations, alleviating client-side overhead. Moreover, a group-aware item representation fusion approach enables fine-grained knowledge sharing among similar users while retaining individual preferences. The proposed fusion loss could be simply plugged into any existing federated recommender systems empowering their capability by adding multi-modality features. Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that GFMFR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal FR baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Cell Painting Image Representation Learning via Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19896v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational models that predict cellular phenotypic responses to chemical and genetic perturbations can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing therapeutic hypotheses and reducing costly wet-lab iteration. However, extracting biologically meaningful and batch-robust cell painting representations remains challenging. Conventional self-supervised and contrastive learning approaches often require a large-scale model and/or a huge amount of carefully curated data, still struggling with batch effects. We present Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN), a novel representation learning framework that aligns embeddings of cells subjected to the same perturbation across different wells, enforcing semantic consistency despite batch effects. Integrated into a masked siamese architecture, this alignment yields features that capture fine-grained morphology while remaining data- and parameter-efficient. For instance, in a gene-gene relationship retrieval benchmark, CWA-MSN outperforms the state-of-the-art publicly available self-supervised (OpenPhenom) and contrastive learning (CellCLIP) methods, improving the benchmark scores by +29\% and +9\%, respectively, while training on substantially fewer data (e.g., 0.2M images for CWA-MSN vs. 2.2M images for OpenPhenom) or smaller model size (e.g., 22M parameters for CWA-MSN vs. 1.48B parameters for CellCLIP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that CWA-MSN is a simple and effective way to learn cell image representation, enabling efficient phenotype modeling even under limited data and parameter budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, reference 4 pages</p></details> |

Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels. Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue, such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper, we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii) maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or domain labels during representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

A Case Study with In-Context Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17552v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be enhanced with test-time computation, which relies on external tools and even other deep learning models. However, existing approaches for integrating non-text modality representations into LLMs typically require additional costly supervised training, restricting on-the-fly adaptation to new domains and modalities. In this work, we explore the feasibility of integrating representations from non-text foundational models (FMs) into text-based LLMs in a training-free manner. We propose In-Context Representation Learning (ICRL) as a proof-of-concept to allow LLMs to adaptively utilize non-text modality representations with few-shot learning. Unlike traditional in-context learning, which incorporates text-label pairs, ICRL replaces text inputs with FM representations, enabling the LLM to perform multi-modal inference without fine-tuning. We evaluate ICRL on a suite of tasks in the molecular domain, investigating three core research questions: (i) how to map FM representations into LLMs in a training-free manner, (ii) what factors influence ICRL performance, and (iii) what mechanisms underlie the effectiveness of ICRL. To the best of our knowledge, ICRL is the first training-free framework for integrating non-text modality representations into text-based LLMs, presenting a promising direction for adaptable, multi-modal generalization.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Sample what you cant compress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02529v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For learned image representations, basic autoencoders often produce blurry results. Reconstruction quality can be improved by incorporating additional penalties such as adversarial (GAN) and perceptual losses. Arguably, these approaches lack a principled interpretation. Concurrently, in generative settings diffusion has demonstrated a remarkable ability to create crisp, high quality results and has solid theoretical underpinnings (from variational inference to direct study as the Fisher Divergence). Our work combines autoencoder representation learning with diffusion and is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate jointly learning a continuous encoder and decoder under a diffusion-based loss and showing that it can lead to higher compression and better generation. We demonstrate that this approach yields better reconstruction quality as compared to GAN-based autoencoders while being easier to tune. We also show that the resulting representation is easier to model with a latent diffusion model as compared to the representation obtained from a state-of-the-art GAN-based loss. Since our decoder is stochastic, it can generate details not encoded in the otherwise deterministic latent representation; we therefore name our approach "Sample what you can't compress", or SWYCC for short.</p></details> |  |

We argue that using positional encoding in point Transformer-based methods serves to aggregate multi-scale features of point clouds. Additionally, we explore parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) through the lens of prompts and adapters, introducing a straightforward yet effective method called PPT for point cloud analysis. PPT incorporates increased patch tokens and trainable positional encoding while keeping most pre-trained model parameters frozen. Extensive experiments validate that PPT is both effective and efficient. Our proposed method of PEFT tasks, namely PPT, with only 1.05M of parameters for training, gets state-of-the-art results in several mainstream datasets, such as 95.01% accuracy in the ScanObjectNN OBJ_BG dataset.

Recently, deep learning-based hashing methods have proven effective for indexing time series based on semantic meaning rather than just raw similarity. The purpose of deep hashing is to map samples with the same semantic meaning to identical binary hash codes, enabling more efficient search and retrieval. Unlike other supervised representation learning methods, supervised deep hashing requires a discretization step to convert real-valued representations into binary codes, but this can induce significant information loss. In this paper, we propose a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss. The proposed deep hashing model maps data to an M-dimensional hyperspherical space to effectively reduce information loss and models each data class as points following distinct vMF distributions. The designed loss aims to maximize the separation between each modeled vMF distribution to provide a better way to maximize the margin between each semantically different data sample. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing baselines. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/jmpq97/vmf-hashing</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, Conference: ICMLA 2025</p></details> |

To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door", "approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper", etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://bpiyush.github.io/lift-website/</p></details> |
| **[Causality-Induced Positional Encoding for Transformer-Based Representation Learning of Non-Sequential Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16629v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positional encoding is essential for supplementing transformer with positional information of tokens. Existing positional encoding methods demand predefined token/feature order, rendering them unsuitable for real-world data with non-sequential yet causally-related features. To address this limitation, we propose CAPE, a novel method that identifies underlying causal structure over non-sequential features as a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) using generalized structural equation modeling. The DAG is then embedded in hyperbolic space where its geometric structure is well-preserved using a hyperboloid model-based approach that effectively captures two important causal graph properties (causal strength & causal specificity). This step yields causality-aware positional encodings for the features, which are converted into their rotary form for integrating with transformer's self-attention mechanism. Theoretical analysis reveals that CAPE-generated rotary positional encodings possess three valuable properties for enhanced self-attention, including causal distance-induced attenuation, causal generality-induced attenuation, and robustness to positional disturbances. We evaluate CAPE over both synthetic and real-word datasets, empirically demonstrating its theoretical properties and effectiveness in enhancing transformer for data with non-sequential features.

In a multi-scale framework, unresolved (subgrid) meso-scale dynamics is upscaled to the homogenized (macro-scale) representation of the heterogeneous material through closure models. Deep learning models trained using meso-scale simulation data are now a popular route to assimilate such closure laws. However, meso-scale simulations are computationally taxing, posing practical challenges in training deep learning-based surrogate models from scratch. In this work, we investigate an alternative meta-learning approach motivated by the idea of tokenization in natural language processing. We show that one can learn a reduced representation of the micro-scale physics to accelerate the meso-scale learning process by tokenizing the meso-scale evolution of the physical fields involved in an archetypal, albeit complex, reactive dynamics problem, \textit{viz.}, shock-induced energy localization in a porous energetic material. A probabilistic latent representation of \textit{micro}-scale dynamics is learned as building blocks for \textit{meso}-scale dynamics. The \textit{meso-}scale latent dynamics model learns the correlation between neighboring building blocks by training over a small dataset of meso-scale simulations. We compare the performance of our model with a physics-aware recurrent convolutional neural network (PARC) trained only on the full meso-scale dataset. We demonstrate that our model can outperform PARC with scarce meso-scale data. The proposed approach accelerates the development of closure models by leveraging inexpensive micro-scale simulations and fast training over a small meso-scale dataset, and can be applied to a range of multi-scale modeling problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 19 figures, complementary results added, restructured Introduction section</p></details> |

To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning. Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.</p></details> | Submitted to TPAMI |

| **[Towards Causal Representation Learning with Observable Sources as Auxiliaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19058v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal representation learning seeks to recover latent factors that generate observational data through a mixing function. Needing assumptions on latent structures or relationships to achieve identifiability in general, prior works often build upon conditional independence given known auxiliary variables. However, prior frameworks limit the scope of auxiliary variables to be external to the mixing function. Yet, in some cases, system-driving latent factors can be easily observed or extracted from data, possibly facilitating identification. In this paper, we introduce a framework of observable sources being auxiliaries, serving as effective conditioning variables. Our main results show that one can identify entire latent variables up to subspace-wise transformations and permutations using volume-preserving encoders. Moreover, when multiple known auxiliary variables are available, we offer a variable-selection scheme to choose those that maximize recoverability of the latent factors given knowledge of the latent causal graph. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on synthetic graph and image data, thereby extending the boundaries of current approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Foundations of Representation Learning using Unlabeled Data: Statistics and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18997v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning from unlabeled data has been extensively studied in statistics, data science and signal processing with a rich literature on techniques for dimension reduction, compression, multi-dimensional scaling among others. However, current deep learning models use new principles for unsupervised representation learning that cannot be easily analyzed using classical theories. For example, visual foundation models have found tremendous success using self-supervision or denoising/masked autoencoders, which effectively learn representations from massive amounts of unlabeled data. However, it remains difficult to characterize the representations learned by these models and to explain why they perform well for diverse prediction tasks or show emergent behavior. To answer these questions, one needs to combine mathematical tools from statistics and optimization. This paper provides an overview of recent theoretical advances in representation learning from unlabeled data and mentions our contributions in this direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Metallic Surface Defect Detection via Anomaly-Guided Pretraining on a Large Industrial Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18919v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pretraining-finetuning paradigm is a crucial strategy in metallic surface defect detection for mitigating the challenges posed by data scarcity. However, its implementation presents a critical dilemma. Pretraining on natural image datasets such as ImageNet, faces a significant domain gap. Meanwhile, naive self-supervised pretraining on in-domain industrial data is often ineffective due to the inability of existing learning objectives to distinguish subtle defect patterns from complex background noise and textures. To resolve this, we introduce Anomaly-Guided Self-Supervised Pretraining (AGSSP), a novel paradigm that explicitly guides representation learning through anomaly priors. AGSSP employs a two-stage framework: (1) it first pretrains the model's backbone by distilling knowledge from anomaly maps, encouraging the network to capture defect-salient features; (2) it then pretrains the detector using pseudo-defect boxes derived from these maps, aligning it with localization tasks. To enable this, we develop a knowledge-enhanced method to generate high-quality anomaly maps and collect a large-scale industrial dataset of 120,000 images. Additionally, we present two small-scale, pixel-level labeled metallic surface defect datasets for validation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSSP consistently enhances performance across various settings, achieving up to a 10\% improvement in mAP@0.5 and 11.4\% in mAP@0.5:0.95 compared to ImageNet-based models. All code, pretrained models, and datasets are publicly available at https://clovermini.github.io/AGSSP-Dev/.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViG-LRGC: Vision Graph Neural Networks with Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18840v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision. Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers. Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark dataset.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, existing SSL methods often rely on complex architectures, anatomy-specific priors, or heavily tuned augmentations, which limit their scalability and generalizability. More critically, these models are prone to shortcut learning, especially in modalities like chest X-rays, where anatomical similarity is high and pathology is subtle. In this work, we introduce DiSSECT -- Discrete Self-Supervision for Efficient Clinical Transferable Representations, a framework that integrates multi-scale vector quantization into the SSL pipeline to impose a discrete representational bottleneck. This constrains the model to learn repeatable, structure-aware features while suppressing view-specific or low-utility patterns, improving representation transfer across tasks and domains. DiSSECT achieves strong performance on both classification and segmentation tasks, requiring minimal or no fine-tuning, and shows particularly high label efficiency in low-label regimes. We validate DiSSECT across multiple public medical imaging datasets, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Autoencoders offer a natural framework for denoising and reconstruction, but their performance degrades under challenging real-world conditions. In this work, we propose TriFusion-AE, a multimodal cross-attention autoencoder that integrates textual priors, monocular depth maps from multi-view images, and LiDAR point clouds to improve robustness. By aligning semantic cues from text, geometric (depth) features from images, and spatial structure from LiDAR, TriFusion-AE learns representations that are resilient to stochastic noise and adversarial perturbations. Interestingly, while showing limited gains under mild perturbations, our model achieves significantly more robust reconstruction under strong adversarial attacks and heavy noise, where CNN-based autoencoders collapse. We evaluate on the nuScenes-mini dataset to reflect realistic low-data deployment scenarios. Our multimodal fusion framework is designed to be model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with any CNN-based point cloud autoencoder for joint representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop</p></details> |

Attribute Prompt Composition for Object Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18715v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to recognize individuals across non-overlapping camera views. While recent advances have achieved remarkable progress, most existing models are constrained to either single-domain or cross-domain scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. Single-domain models tend to overfit to domain-specific features, whereas cross-domain models often rely on diverse normalization strategies that may inadvertently suppress identity-specific discriminative cues. To address these limitations, we propose an Attribute Prompt Composition (APC) framework, which exploits textual semantics to jointly enhance discrimination and generalization. Specifically, we design an Attribute Prompt Generator (APG) consisting of a Semantic Attribute Dictionary (SAD) and a Prompt Composition Module (PCM). SAD is an over-complete attribute dictionary to provide rich semantic descriptions, while PCM adaptively composes relevant attributes from SAD to generate discriminative attribute-aware features. In addition, motivated by the strong generalization ability of Vision-Language Models (VLM), we propose a Fast-Slow Training Strategy (FSTS) to balance ReID-specific discrimination and generalizable representation learning. Specifically, FSTS adopts a Fast Update Stream (FUS) to rapidly acquire ReID-specific discriminative knowledge and a Slow Update Stream (SUS) to retain the generalizable knowledge inherited from the pre-trained VLM. Through a mutual interaction, the framework effectively focuses on ReID-relevant features while mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on both conventional and Domain Generalized (DG) ReID datasets demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting superior performances in terms of both discrimination and generalization.

While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

One such self-supervised learning approach is masked spectrogram modeling, where the objective is to learn semantically rich contextual representations by predicting removed or hidden portions of the input audio spectrogram. With the Transformer neural architecture at its core, masked spectrogram modeling has emerged as the prominent approach for learning general purpose audio representations, a.k.a. audio foundation models. Meanwhile, addressing the issues of the Transformer architecture, in particular the underlying Scaled Dot-product Attention operation, which scales quadratically with input sequence length, has led to renewed interest in recurrent sequence modeling approaches. Among them, Selective structured state space models (such as Mamba) and extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) are the two most promising approaches which have experienced widespread adoption. While the body of work on these two topics continues to grow, there is currently a lack of an adequate overview encompassing the intersection of these topics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the aforementioned research domains, covering masked spectrogram modeling and the previously mentioned neural sequence modeling architectures, Mamba and xLSTM. Further, we compare Transformers, Mamba and xLSTM based masked spectrogram models in a unified, reproducible framework on ten diverse downstream audio classification tasks, which will help interested readers to make informed decisions regarding suitability of the evaluated approaches to adjacent applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to produce structure-aware and task-discriminative representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures.

However, its application to personalized sticker retrieval remains largely unexplored and presents unique challenges: existing relevance-based generative retrieval methods typically lack personalization, leading to a mismatch between diverse user expectations and the retrieved results. To address this gap, we propose PEARL, a novel generative framework for personalized sticker retrieval, and make two key contributions: (i) To encode user-specific sticker preferences, we design a representation learning model to learn discriminative user representations. It is trained on three prediction tasks that leverage personal information and click history; and (ii) To generate stickers aligned with a user's query intent, we propose a novel intent-aware learning objective that prioritizes stickers associated with higher-ranked intents. Empirical results from both offline evaluations and online tests demonstrate that PEARL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP2025</p></details> |

We first train a pose autoencoder that encodes sign poses into a compact latent space using an articulator-based disentanglement strategy, where features corresponding to the face, right hand, left hand, and body are modeled separately to promote structured and interpretable representation learning. Next, a non-autoregressive transformer decoder is trained to predict these latent representations from word-level text embeddings of the input sentence. To guide this process, we apply channel-aware regularization by aligning predicted latent distributions with priors extracted from the ground-truth encodings using a KL divergence loss. The contribution of each channel to the loss is weighted according to its associated articulator region, enabling the model to account for the relative importance of different articulators during training. Our approach does not rely on gloss supervision or pretrained models, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[An Efficient Self-Supervised Framework for Long-Sequence EEG Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17873v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals generally exhibit low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and high inter-subject variability, making generalization across subjects and domains challenging. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly self-supervised learning with Transformer-based architectures, have shown promise in EEG representation learning. However, their quadratic computational complexity increases memory usage and slows inference, making them inefficient for modeling long-range dependencies. Moreover, most existing approaches emphasize either explicit window segmentation of the temporal signal or spectral-only input embedding while neglecting raw temporal dynamics. In this paper, we propose EEGM2, a self-supervised framework that overcomes these limitations. EEGM2 adopts a U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture integrated with Mamba-2 to achieve linear computational complexity, thereby reducing memory usage and improving inference speed. Meanwhile, the selective information propagation mechanism of Mamba-2 enables the model to effectively capture and preserve long-range dependencies in raw EEG signals, where traditional RNN or CNN architectures often struggle. Moreover, EEGM2 employs a self-supervised pre-training objective that reconstructs raw EEG using a combined L1 and spectral (Fourier-based) loss, enhancing generalization by jointly preserving temporal dynamics and spectral characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that EEGM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-sequence modeling and classification. Further evaluations show that EEGM2 consistently outperforms existing models, demonstrating strong generalization across subjects and tasks, as well as transferability across domains. Overall, EEGM2 offers an efficient and scalable solution suitable for deployment on resource-constrained brain-computer interface (BCI) devices.</p></details> | 10 pages |

In Earth observation, early multimodal data fusion methods were based on specific neural network architectures and supervised learning. Ever since, the scarcity of labeled data has motivated self-supervised learning techniques. State-of-the-art multimodal representation learning techniques leverage the spatial alignment between satellite data from different modalities acquired over the same geographic area in order to foster a semantic alignment in the latent space. In this paper, we investigate how this methods can preserve task-relevant information that is not shared across modalities. First, we show, under simplifying assumptions, when alignment strategies fundamentally lead to an information loss. Then, we support our theoretical insight through numerical experiments in more realistic settings. With those theoretical and empirical evidences, we hope to support new developments in contrastive learning for the combination of multimodal satellite data.

While Transformer-based models have advanced time series tasks, they often struggle with feature redundancy and limited generalization capabilities. Drawing inspiration from classical CNN architectures' pyramidal structure, we propose a Multi-Scale Representation Learning Framework based on a Conv-like ScaleFusion Transformer. Our approach introduces a temporal convolution-like structure that combines patching operations with multi-head attention, enabling progressive temporal dimension compression and feature channel expansion. We further develop a novel cross-scale attention mechanism for effective feature fusion across different temporal scales, along with a log-space normalization method for variable-length sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior feature independence, reduced redundancy, and better performance in forecasting and classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes TACTFL, a unified framework for semi-supervised multi-modal federated learning. TACTFL introduces a modality-agnostic temporal contrastive training scheme that conducts representation learning from unlabelled client data by leveraging temporal alignment across modalities. However, as clients perform self-supervised training on heterogeneous data, local models may diverge semantically. To mitigate this, TACTFL incorporates a similarity-guided model aggregation strategy that dynamically weights client models based on their representational consistency, promoting global alignment. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and modalities, including video, audio, and wearable sensors, demonstrate that TACTFL achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, on the UCF101 dataset with only 10% labelled data, TACTFL attains 68.48% top-1 accuracy, significantly outperforming the FedOpt baseline of 35.35%.

Models like wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT have achieved state-of-the-art results in tasks such as speech recognition, particularly in monolingual settings. However, multilingual SSL models tend to underperform their monolingual counterparts on each individual language, especially in multilingual scenarios with few languages such as the bilingual setting. In this work, we investigate a novel approach to reduce this performance gap by introducing limited visual grounding into bilingual speech SSL models. Our results show that visual grounding benefits both monolingual and bilingual models, with especially pronounced gains for the latter, reducing the multilingual performance gap on zero-shot phonetic discrimination from 31.5% for audio-only models to 8.04% with grounding.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Revisiting Bisimulation Metric for Robust Representations in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18519v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks. However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Audio Contrastive-based Fine-tuning: Decoupling Representation Learning and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11895v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard fine-tuning of pre-trained audio models couples representation learning with classifier training, which can obscure the true quality of the learned representations. In this work, we advocate for a disentangled two-stage framework that separates representation refinement from downstream evaluation. First, we employ a "contrastive-tuning" stage to explicitly improve the geometric structure of the model's embedding space. Subsequently, we introduce a dual-probe evaluation protocol to assess the quality of these refined representations from a geometric perspective. This protocol uses a linear probe to measure global linear separability and a k-Nearest Neighbours probe to investigate the local structure of class clusters. Our experiments on a diverse set of audio classification tasks show that our framework provides a better foundation for classification, leading to improved accuracy. Our newly proposed dual-probing framework acts as a powerful analytical lens, demonstrating why contrastive learning is more effective by revealing a superior embedding space. It significantly outperforms vanilla fine-tuning, particularly on single-label datasets with a large number of classes, and also surpasses strong baselines on multi-label tasks using a Jaccard-weighted loss. Our findings demonstrate that decoupling representation refinement from classifier training is a broadly effective strategy for unlocking the full potential of pre-trained audio models. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to ICASSP 2026 and is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[GraphTorque: Torque-Driven Rewiring Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21422v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process, motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to improve representation learning in heterophilous and homophilous graphs. Specifically, we define the torque by treating the feature distance as a lever arm vector and the neighbor feature as a force vector weighted by the homophily disparity between nodes. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing the impact of irrelevant information and boosting pertinent signals during message passing. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art rewiring methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large language models have further improved the ability to extract meaningful representations from clinical texts. However, clinical notes are often missing. For example, in our analysis of the MIMIC-IV dataset, 24.5% of patients have no available discharge summaries. In such cases, representations can be learned from other modalities such as structured data, chest X-rays, or radiology reports. Yet the availability of these modalities is influenced by clinical decision-making and varies across patients, resulting in modality missing-not-at-random (MMNAR) patterns. We propose a causal representation learning framework that leverages observed data and informative missingness in multimodal clinical records. It consists of: (1) an MMNAR-aware modality fusion component that integrates structured data, imaging, and text while conditioning on missingness patterns to capture patient health and clinician-driven assignment; (2) a modality reconstruction component with contrastive learning to ensure semantic sufficiency in representation learning; and (3) a multitask outcome prediction model with a rectifier that corrects for residual bias from specific modality observation patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across MIMIC-IV and eICU show consistent gains over the strongest baselines, achieving up to 13.8% AUC improvement for hospital readmission and 13.1% for ICU admission.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proc. of EMNLP 2025 (18 pages)</p></details> |
| **[VQToken: Neural Discrete Token Representation Learning for Extreme Token Reduction in Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16980v5)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Token-based video representation has emerged as a promising approach for enabling large language models (LLMs) to interpret video content. However, existing token reduction techniques, such as pruning and merging, often disrupt essential positional embeddings and rely on continuous visual tokens sampled from nearby pixels with similar spatial-temporal locations. By removing only a small fraction of tokens, these methods still produce relatively lengthy continuous sequences, which falls short of the extreme compression required to balance computational efficiency and token count in video LLMs. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Extreme Short Token Reduction, which aims to represent entire videos using a minimal set of discrete tokens. We propose VQToken, a neural discrete token representation framework that (i) applies adaptive vector quantization to continuous ViT embeddings to learn a compact codebook and (ii) preserves spatial-temporal positions via a token hash function by assigning each grid-level token to its nearest codebook entry. On the Extreme Short Token Reduction task, our VQToken compresses sequences to just 0.07 percent of their original length while incurring only a 0.66 percent drop in accuracy on the NextQA-MC benchmark. It also achieves comparable performance on ActNet-QA, Long Video Bench, and VideoMME. We further introduce the Token Information Density (TokDense) metric and formalize fixed-length and adaptive-length subtasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in both settings. Our approach dramatically lowers theoretical complexity, increases information density, drastically reduces token counts, and enables efficient video LLMs in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Past and Future: Distribution-Aware Alignment for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14181v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although contrastive and other representation-learning methods have long been explored in vision and NLP, their adoption in modern time series forecasters remains limited. We believe they hold strong promise for this domain. To unlock this potential, we explicitly align past and future representations, thereby bridging the distributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we introduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that establishes a new representation paradigm, distinct from contrastive learning, by aligning auxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeding them back into any base forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its superior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arise primarily from correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future outputs. Additionally, we provide two theoretical justifications for how reconstruction improves forecasting generalization and how alignment increases the mutual information between learned representations and predicted targets.

Unlike prior approaches relying on text or vision, STAR leverages speech as it constitutes a natural modality for interaction. As an initial step to validate the feasibility of the system, we demonstrate through representation learning experiments that spoken sound event semantics can be effectively extracted from raw speech, capturing both auditory events and scene cues. Leveraging the semantic representations, STAR incorporates a bridge network for representation mapping and a two-stage training strategy to achieve end-to-end synthesis. With a 76.9% reduction in speech processing latency, STAR demonstrates superior generation performance over the cascaded systems. Overall, STAR establishes speech as a direct interaction signal for audio generation, thereby bridging representation learning and multimodal synthesis.

| **[DeepInsert: Early Layer Bypass for Efficient and Performant Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19327v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hyperscaling of data and parameter count in transformer models is yielding diminishing performance improvement, especially when weighed against training costs. Such plateauing underlines a growing need for more efficient finetuning and inference, without sacrificing performance. This is particularly pressing for multimodal learning, where the overhead of processing multimodal tokens alongside language data often limits the practical viability of these systems. In parallel, advances in representation learning and interpretability have deepened our understanding of how such models process and encode information. Notably, recent work has uncovered implicit cross-modal alignment in the deeper layers of large pretrained models. Interestingly, this aligns with our own observations that models naturally defer most cross-modal token interactions to deeper stages of computation. Building on this, we propose a simple modification. Instead of concatenation with the language prompt at the start, we insert multimodal tokens directly into the middle, allowing them to entirely bypass the early layers. Our results with diverse modalities: 1) LLaVA \& BLIP for vision, 2) LTU for audio, and 3) MoLCA for molecular data, indicate that our method reduces computational costs during both training and inference, while at the very least, preserving, if not surpassing the performance of existing baselines. Our work has important implications for scaling and composing pretrained models in a resource-efficient manner.</p></details> |  |

We consider a setting where the UL CCM is mapped to DL CCM by a mapping function. We first present a theoretical error analysis of learning a nonlinear embedding by constructing a mapping function, which points to the importance of the Lipschitz regularity of the mapping function for achieving high estimation performance. Then, based on the theoretical ground, we propose a representation learning algorithm as a solution for the estimation problem, where Gaussian RBF kernel interpolators are chosen to map UL CCMs to their DL counterparts. The proposed algorithm is based on the optimization of an objective function that fits a regression model between the DL CCM and UL CCM samples in the training dataset and preserves the local geometric structure of the data in the UL CCM space, while explicitly regulating the Lipschitz continuity of the mapping function in light of our theoretical findings. The proposed algorithm surpasses benchmark methods in terms of three error metrics as shown by simulations.</p></details> |  |

To achieve better performance on downstream tasks such as gene expression prediction, large-scale pre-training is required to obtain generalisable representations that can bridge histology and transcriptomics across tissues, protocols, and laboratories. Existing cross-modal pre-training approaches for spatial transcriptomics rely on either gene names or expression values in isolation, which strips the gene branch of essential semantics and breaks the association between each gene and its quantitative magnitude. In addition, by restricting supervision to image-text alignment, these methods ignore intrinsic visual cues that are critical for learning robust image features. We present CoMTIP, the first Contrastive Masked Text-Image Pretraining framework that jointly learns from images, gene names, and expression values while capturing fine-grained visual context for spatial transcriptomics. The vision branch uses Masked Feature Modeling to reconstruct occluded patches and learn context-aware image embeddings. The text branch applies a scalable Gene-Text Encoder that processes all gene sentences in parallel, enriches each gene and its numerical value with dedicated embeddings, and employs Pair-aware Adversarial Training (PAAT) to preserve correct gene-value associations. Image and text representations are aligned in a shared InfoNCE-optimised space. Experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets show that CoMTIP not only surpasses previous methods on diverse downstream tasks but also achieves zero-shot gene expression prediction, a capability that existing approaches do not provide.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced semantic distinctions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While this emerging field shows tremendous promise in applications, it faces significant challenges in motion consistency, computational efficiency, and ethical considerations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of diffusion-based video generation, examining its evolution, technical foundations, and practical applications. We present a systematic taxonomy of current methodologies, analyze architectural innovations and optimization strategies, and investigate applications across low-level vision tasks such as denoising and super-resolution. Additionally, we explore the synergies between diffusionbased video generation and related domains, including video representation learning, question answering, and retrieval. Compared to the existing surveys (Lei et al., 2024a;b; Melnik et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2023; Xing et al., 2024c) which focus on specific aspects of video generation, such as human video synthesis (Lei et al., 2024a) or long-form content generation (Lei et al., 2024b), our work provides a broader, more updated, and more fine-grained perspective on diffusion-based approaches with a special section for evaluation metrics, industry solutions, and training engineering techniques in video generation. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of diffusion models and video generation, providing insights into both the theoretical frameworks and practical implementations that drive this rapidly evolving field.

However, due to the high training cost and inconsistencies in learned representations, there is significant interest in facilitating communication between representations and ensuring compatibility across independently trained neural networks. In the literature, two primary approaches are commonly used to adapt different learned representations: affine transformations, which adapt well to specific distributions but can significantly alter the original representation, and orthogonal transformations, which preserve the original structure with strict geometric constraints but limit adaptability. A key challenge is adapting the latent spaces of updated models to align with those of previous models on downstream distributions while preserving the newly learned representation spaces. In this paper, we impose a relaxed orthogonality constraint, namely $\lambda$-orthogonality regularization, while learning an affine transformation, to obtain distribution-specific adaptation while retaining the original learned representations. Extensive experiments across various architectures and datasets validate our approach, demonstrating that it preserves the model's zero-shot performance and ensures compatibility across model updates.

While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Tight PAC-Bayesian Risk Certificates for Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03486v4)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive representation learning is a modern paradigm for learning representations of unlabeled data via augmentations -- precisely, contrastive models learn to embed semantically similar pairs of samples (positive pairs) closer than independently drawn samples (negative samples). In spite of its empirical success and widespread use in foundation models, statistical theory for contrastive learning remains less explored. Recent works have developed generalization error bounds for contrastive losses, but the resulting risk certificates are either vacuous (certificates based on Rademacher complexity or $f$-divergence) or require strong assumptions about samples that are unreasonable in practice. The present paper develops non-vacuous PAC-Bayesian risk certificates for contrastive representation learning, considering the practical considerations of the popular SimCLR framework. Notably, we take into account that SimCLR reuses positive pairs of augmented data as negative samples for other data, thereby inducing strong dependence and making classical PAC or PAC-Bayesian bounds inapplicable. We further refine existing bounds on the downstream classification loss by incorporating SimCLR-specific factors, including data augmentation and temperature scaling, and derive risk certificates for the contrastive zero-one risk. The resulting bounds for contrastive loss and downstream prediction are much tighter than those of previous risk certificates, as demonstrated by experiments on CIFAR-10.</p></details> |  |

However, such data are inherently heterogeneous, high-dimensional, and exhibit complex intra- and inter-modality dependencies. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer powerful tools for modeling such structure. Yet, most existing methods rely on prior knowledge or predefined similarity networks to construct graphs, which are often undirected or unweighted, failing to capture the directionality and strength of biological interactions. Interpretability at both the modality and feature levels also remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose TF-DWGNet, a novel Graph Neural Network framework that combines tree-based Directed Weighted graph construction with Tensor Fusion for multiclass cancer subtype classification. TF-DWGNet introduces two key innovations: a supervised tree-based approach for constructing directed, weighted graphs tailored to each omics modality, and a tensor fusion mechanism that captures unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal interactions using low-rank decomposition for efficiency. TF-DWGNet enables modality-specific representation learning, joint embedding fusion, and interpretable subtype prediction. Experiments on real-world cancer datasets show that TF-DWGNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics and statistical tests.

In this paper, we propose Dual-Masked Autoencoder (DMAE), a novel masked time-series modeling framework for unsupervised MTS representation learning. DMAE formulates two complementary pretext tasks: (1) reconstructing masked values based on visible attributes, and (2) estimating latent representations of masked features, guided by a teacher encoder. To further improve representation quality, we introduce a feature-level alignment constraint that encourages the predicted latent representations to align with the teacher's outputs. By jointly optimizing these objectives, DMAE learns temporally coherent and semantically rich representations. Comprehensive evaluations across classification, regression, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves consistent and superior performance over competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |

Although numerous deep learning-based automatic segmentation methods have been developed, they still struggle to segment small, irregular, or anatomically complex organs. Moreover, most current methods focus on spatial-domain analysis, often overlooking the synergistic potential of frequency-domain representations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework named FMD-TransUNet for precise abdominal multi-organ segmentation. It innovatively integrates the Multi-axis External Weight Block (MEWB) and the improved dual attention module (DA+) into the TransUNet framework. The MEWB extracts multi-axis frequency-domain features to capture both global anatomical structures and local boundary details, providing complementary information to spatial-domain representations. The DA+ block utilizes depthwise separable convolutions and incorporates spatial and channel attention mechanisms to enhance feature fusion, reduce redundant information, and narrow the semantic gap between the encoder and decoder. Experimental validation on the Synapse dataset shows that FMD-TransUNet outperforms other recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average DSC of 81.32\% and a HD of 16.35 mm across eight abdominal organs. Compared to the baseline model, the average DSC increased by 3.84\%, and the average HD decreased by 15.34 mm. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of FMD-TransUNet in improving the accuracy of abdominal multi-organ segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Electrocardiogram (ECG) is critical for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac health, but obtaining large-scale annotated ECG datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent ECG Self-Supervised Learning (eSSL) methods mitigate this by learning features without extensive labels but fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and require extensive task-specific fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SuPreME}$, a $\textbf{Su}$pervised $\textbf{Pre}$-training framework for $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{E}$CG representation learning. SuPreME is pre-trained using structured diagnostic labels derived from ECG report entities through a one-time offline extraction with Large Language Models (LLMs), which help denoise, standardize cardiac concepts, and improve clinical representation learning. By fusing ECG signals with textual cardiac queries instead of fixed labels, SuPreME enables zero-shot classification of unseen conditions without further fine-tuning. We evaluate SuPreME on six downstream datasets covering 106 cardiac conditions, achieving superior zero-shot AUC performance of $77.20\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art eSSLs by $4.98\%$. Results demonstrate SuPreME's effectiveness in leveraging structured, clinically relevant knowledge for high-quality ECG representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of The 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025)</p></details> |

However, its progress is impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical image understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Upon ...</summary><p>Upon further review, we identified that our dataset requires optimization to ensure research reliability and accuracy.

While the continuous influx of new, unlabeled audio presents an opportunity to enrich these static representations, a naive approach is to retrain the model from scratch using all available data. However, this method is computationally prohibitive and discards the valuable knowledge embedded in the previously trained model weights. To address this inefficiency, we propose SONAR (Self-distilled cONtinual pre-training for domain adaptive Audio Representation), a continual pre-training framework built upon BEATs. SONAR effectively adapts to new domains while mitigating catastrophic forgetting by tackling three key challenges: implementing a joint sampling strategy for new and prior data, applying regularization to balance specificity and generality, and dynamically expanding the tokenizer codebook for novel acoustic patterns. Experiments across four distinct domains demonstrate that our method achieves both high adaptability and robust resistance to forgetting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[DiRW: Path-Aware Digraph Learning for Heterophily](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10320v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has emerged as a powerful representation learning tool for graph-structured data. However, most approaches are tailored for undirected graphs, neglecting the abundant information in the edges of directed graphs (digraphs). In fact, digraphs are widely applied in the real world and confirmed to address heterophily challenges. Despite recent advancements, existing spatial- and spectral-based DiGNNs have limitations due to their complex learning mechanisms and reliance on high-quality topology, resulting in low efficiency and unstable performance. To address these issues, we propose Directed Random Walk (DiRW), a plug-and-play strategy for most spatial-based DiGNNs and also an innovative model which offers a new digraph learning paradigm. Specifically, it utilizes a direction-aware path sampler optimized from the perspectives of walk probability, length, and number in a weight-free manner by considering node profiles and topologies. Building upon this, DiRW incorporates a node-wise learnable path aggregator for generalized node representations. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that DiRW: (1) enhances most spatial-based methods as a plug-and-play strategy; (2) achieves SOTA performance as a new digraph learning paradigm.

| **[Latent Zoning Network: A Unified Principle for Generative Modeling, Representation Learning, and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15591v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three core problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN) as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images, text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently (representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously (joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders, LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA classification accuracy on CIFAR10. The code and trained models are available at https://github.com/microsoft/latent-zoning-networks.

Existing methods, including Transformer and MLP-based models, often struggle to capture these intertwined characteristics in a unified and structured manner. We propose the Dual Pyramid Attention Network (DPANet), a novel architecture that explicitly decouples and concurrently models temporal multi-scale dynamics and spectral multi-resolution periodicities. DPANet constructs two parallel pyramids: a Temporal Pyramid built on progressive downsampling, and a Frequency Pyramid built on band-pass filtering. The core of our model is the Cross-Pyramid Fusion Block, which facilitates deep, interactive information exchange between corresponding pyramid levels via cross-attention. This fusion proceeds in a coarse-to-fine hierarchy, enabling global context to guide local representation learning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that DPANet achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming prior models.

| **[BiRQ: Bi-Level Self-Labeling Random Quantization for Self-Supervised Speech Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15430v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech is a rich signal, and labeled audio-text pairs are costly, making self-supervised learning essential for scalable representation learning. A core challenge in speech SSL is generating pseudo-labels that are both informative and efficient: strong labels, such as those used in HuBERT, improve downstream performance but rely on external encoders and multi-stage pipelines, while efficient methods like BEST-RQ achieve simplicity at the cost of weaker labels. We propose BiRQ, a bilevel SSL framework that combines the efficiency of BEST-RQ with the refinement benefits of HuBERT-style label enhancement. The key idea is to reuse part of the model itself as a pseudo-label generator: intermediate representations are discretized by a random-projection quantizer to produce enhanced labels, while anchoring labels derived directly from the raw input stabilize training and prevent collapse. Training is formulated as an efficient first-order bilevel optimization problem, solved end-to-end with differentiable Gumbel-softmax selection. This design eliminates the need for external label encoders, reduces memory cost, and enables iterative label refinement in an end-to-end fashion. BiRQ consistently improves over BEST-RQ while maintaining low complexity and computational efficiency. We validate our method on various datasets, including 960-hour LibriSpeech, 150-hour AMI meetings and 5,000-hour YODAS, demonstrating consistent gains over BEST-RQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages including reference</p></details> |

However, despite their crucial role in shaping tactile experiences, these material characteristics have been largely neglected in existing tactile representation learning methods. Most approaches primarily focus on aligning tactile data with visual or textual information, overlooking the richness of tactile feedback that comes from understanding the materials' inherent properties. In this work, we address this gap by revisiting the tactile representation learning framework and incorporating material-aware priors into the learning process. These priors, which represent pre-learned characteristics specific to different materials, allow tactile models to better capture and generalize the nuances of surface texture. Our method enables more accurate, contextually rich tactile feedback across diverse materials and textures, improving performance in real-world applications such as robotics, haptic feedback systems, and material editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This publication has infringed on the authorship rights of other researchers.

In contrast, prevailing machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition.

In this paper, we overview a promising learning paradigm, i.e., Modular Machine Learning (MML), as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs capable of addressing these issues. We begin by systematically and comprehensively surveying the existing literature on modular machine learning, with a particular focus on modular data representation and modular models. Then, we propose a unified MML framework for LLMs, which decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning. Specifically, the MML paradigm discussed in this article is able to: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable an interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We further elaborate a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. Last but not least, we critically identify the remaining key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, we believe the integration of the MML with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets.

Traditional gradient-based training methods are inefficient, requiring numerous iterative updates and high power consumption. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines hierarchical decomposition with FPGA-based direct equation solving and incremental learning. Our method divides the neural network into two functional tiers: lower layers are optimized via single-step equation solving on FPGAs for efficient and parallelizable feature extraction, while higher layers employ adaptive incremental learning to support continual updates without full retraining. Building upon this foundation, we introduce the Compound LLM framework, which explicitly deploys LLM modules across both hierarchy levels. The lower-level LLM handles reusable representation learning with minimal energy overhead, while the upper-level LLM performs adaptive decision-making through energy-aware updates. This integrated design enhances scalability, reduces redundant computation, and aligns with the principles of sustainable AI. Theoretical analysis and architectural insights demonstrate that our method reduces computational costs significantly while preserving high model performance, making it well-suited for edge deployment and real-time adaptation in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

Nevertheless, a flexible pretrain-and-finetune pipeline for multiple visual modalities remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal learning framework, termed OmniSegmentor. It has two key innovations: 1) Based on ImageNet, we assemble a large-scale dataset for multi-modal pretraining, called ImageNeXt, which contains five popular visual modalities. 2) We provide an efficient pretraining manner to endow the model with the capacity to encode different modality information in the ImageNeXt. For the first time, we introduce a universal multi-modal pretraining framework that consistently amplifies the model's perceptual capabilities across various scenarios, regardless of the arbitrary combination of the involved modalities. Remarkably, our OmniSegmentor achieves new state-of-the-art records on a wide range of multi-modal semantic segmentation datasets, including NYU Depthv2, EventScape, MFNet, DeLiVER, SUNRGBD, and KITTI-360.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

This is challenging since the progression of disease and response to treatment vary substantially across patients. Here, we propose to learn a representation of the early dynamics of treatment response from imaging data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The longitudinal change in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of the breast forms trajectories in the latent space, serving as basis for prediction of successful response. The multi-task model represents appearance, fosters temporal continuity and accounts for the comparably high heterogeneity in the non-responder cohort.In experiments on the publicly available ISPY-2 dataset, a linear classifier in the latent trajectory space achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.761 using only pre-treatment data (T0), 0.811 using early response (T0 + T1), and 0.861 using four imaging time points (T0 -> T3).

| **[Exploring the Global-to-Local Attention Scheme in Graph Transformers: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14863v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) show considerable potential in graph representation learning. The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer, featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping linear complexity.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deepfake attribution (DFA) works primarily focus on the interaction among various domains in vision modality, and other modalities such as texts and face parsing are not fully explored. Besides, they tend to fail to assess the generalization performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion in a fine-grained manner. In this paper, we propose a novel parsing-aware vision language model with dynamic contrastive learning(PVLM) method for zero-shot deepfake attribution (ZS-DFA),which facilitates effective and fine-grained traceability to unseen advanced generators. Specifically, we conduct a novel and fine-grained ZS-DFA benchmark to evaluate the attribution performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion. Besides, we propose an innovative parsing-guided vision language model with dynamic contrastive learning (PVLM) method to capture general and diverse attribution features. We are motivated by the observation that the preservation of source face attributes in facial images generated by GAN and diffusion models varies significantly. We employ the inherent face attributes preservation differences to capture face parsing-aware forgery representations. Therefore, we devise a novel parsing encoder to focus on global face attribute embeddings, enabling parsing-guided DFA representation learning via dynamic vision-parsing matching. Additionally, we present a novel deepfake attribution contrastive center loss to pull relevant generators closer and push irrelevant ones away, which can be introduced into DFA models to enhance traceability. Experimental results show that our model exceeds the state-of-the-art on the ZS-DFA benchmark via various protocol evaluations.</p></details> |  |

However, the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG signals limits model performance, making feature selection (FS) vital for optimizing representations learned by neural network encoders. Existing FS methods are seldom designed specifically for EEG diagnosis; many are architecture-dependent and lack interpretability, limiting their applicability. Moreover, most rely on single-iteration data, resulting in limited robustness to variability. To address these issues, we propose IEFS-GMB, an Information Entropy-based Feature Selection method guided by a Gradient Memory Bank. This approach constructs a dynamic memory bank storing historical gradients, computes feature importance via information entropy, and applies entropy-based weighting to select informative EEG features. Experiments on four public neurological disease datasets show that encoders enhanced with IEFS-GMB achieve accuracy improvements of 0.64% to 6.45% over baseline models. The method also outperforms four competing FS techniques and improves model interpretability, supporting its practical use in clinical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mutual Information Perspective on Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models for Positive View Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13718v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In image generation, Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models (MLVGMs) employ multiple latent variables to gradually shape the final images, from global characteristics to finer and local details (e.g., StyleGAN, NVAE), emerging as powerful tools for diverse applications. Yet their generative dynamics remain only empirically observed, without a systematic understanding of each latent variable's impact. In this work, we propose a novel framework that quantifies the contribution of each latent variable using Mutual Information (MI) as a metric. Our analysis reveals that current MLVGMs often underutilize some latent variables, and provides actionable insights for their use in downstream applications. With this foundation, we introduce a method for generating synthetic data for Self-Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning (SSCRL). By leveraging the hierarchical and disentangled variables of MLVGMs, our approach produces diverse and semantically meaningful views without the need for real image data. Additionally, we introduce a Continuous Sampling (CS) strategy, where the generator dynamically creates new samples during SSCRL training, greatly increasing data variability. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these contributions, showing that MLVGMs' generated views compete on par with or even surpass views generated from real data. This work establishes a principled approach to understanding and exploiting MLVGMs, advancing both generative modeling and self-supervised learning.

This temporal variability severely impairs the generalization of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Existing frameworks fail to capture the complex interactions of short- and long-term dependencies, making them susceptible to spurious correlations that degrade generalization. To address these limitations, we propose DeCoP, a Dependency Controlled Pre-training framework that explicitly models dynamic, multi-scale dependencies by simulating evolving inter-patch dependencies. At the input level, DeCoP introduces Instance-wise Patch Normalization (IPN) to mitigate distributional shifts while preserving the unique characteristics of each patch, creating a robust foundation for representation learning. At the latent level, a hierarchical Dependency Controlled Learning (DCL) strategy explicitly models inter-patch dependencies across multiple temporal scales, with an Instance-level Contrastive Module (ICM) enhances global generalization by learning instance-discriminative representations from time-invariant positive pairs. DeCoP achieves state-of-the-art results on ten datasets with lower computing resources, improving MSE by 3% on ETTh1 over PatchTST using only 37% of the FLOPs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a novel method that integrates graph representation learning with vision-language models (VLMs) to deliver explainable DR diagnosis. Our approach leverages optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images by constructing biologically informed graphs that encode key retinal vascular features such as vessel morphology and spatial connectivity. A graph neural network (GNN) then performs DR staging while integrated gradients highlight critical nodes and edges and their individual features that drive the classification decisions. We collect this graph-based knowledge which attributes the model's prediction to physiological structures and their characteristics. We then transform it into textual descriptions for VLMs. We perform instruction-tuning with these textual descriptions and the corresponding image to train a student VLM. This final agent can classify the disease and explain its decision in a human interpretable way solely based on a single image input. Experimental evaluations on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate that our method not only improves classification accuracy but also offers more clinically interpretable results. An expert study further demonstrates that our method provides more accurate diagnostic explanations and paves the way for precise localization of pathologies in OCTA images.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

Recent studies have shown that abstract images-constructed by primitive shapes-can indeed convey visual semantic information to deep learning models. However, representations obtained from such images often fall short compared to those derived from traditional raster images. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this performance gap and investigate how much high-level semantic content can be captured at different abstraction levels. To this end, we introduce the Hierarchical Abstraction Image Dataset (HAID), a novel data collection that comprises abstract images generated from normal raster images at multiple levels of abstraction. We then train and evaluate conventional vision systems on HAID across various tasks including classification, segmentation, and object detection, providing a comprehensive study between rasterised and abstract image representations. We also discuss if the abstract image can be considered as a potentially effective format for conveying visual semantic information and contributing to vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to BMVC 2025</p></details> |
| **[CSMoE: An Efficient Remote Sensing Foundation Model with Soft Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14104v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning through masked autoencoders has attracted great attention for remote sensing (RS) foundation model (FM) development, enabling improved representation learning across diverse sensors and downstream tasks. However, existing RS FMs often either suffer from substantial computational complexity during both training and inference or exhibit limited representational capacity. These issues restrict their practical applicability in RS. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptation for enhancing the efficiency of RS FMs by integrating the Soft mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism into the FM. The integration of Soft MoEs into the FM allows modality-specific expert specialization alongside shared cross-sensor representation learning. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptation, we apply it on the Cross-Sensor Masked Autoencoder (CSMAE) model, resulting in the Cross-Sensor Mixture-of-Experts (CSMoE) model. In addition, we introduce a thematic-climatic descriptor-driven sampling strategy for the construction of a representative and diverse training set to train our CSMoE model. Extensive experiments on scene classification, semantic segmentation, and content-based image retrieval demonstrate that our adaptation yields a reduction in computational requirements while maintaining or improving representational performance. Compared to state-of-the-art RS FMs, CSMoE achieves a superior trade-off between representational capacity, accuracy, and computational efficiency. On average, CSMoE achieves more than twice the computational efficiency of existing RS FMs, while maintaining competitive performance across all experiments. These results show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptation for creating computationally efficient RS FMs. The code for the model, the training set creation, and the model weights will be available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/csmoe.</p></details> |  |

However, after being fine-tuned on a fixed set of bonafide and spoofed audio clips, they often fail to generalize to novel deepfake methods not represented in training. To address this, we propose a mixture-of-LoRA-experts approach that integrates multiple low-rank adapters (LoRA) into the model's attention layers. A routing mechanism selectively activates specialized experts, enhancing adaptability to evolving deepfake attacks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms standard fine-tuning in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, reducing equal error rates relative to baseline models. Notably, our best MoE-LoRA model lowers the average out-of-domain EER from 8.55\% to 6.08\%, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving generalizable audio deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Unlike general-domain settings where more data often leads to better performance, naively scaling to large collections of noisy reports can plateau or even degrade model learning. We ask whether large language model (LLM) encoders can provide robust clinical representations that transfer across diverse styles and better guide image-text alignment. We introduce LLM2VEC4CXR, a domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports, and LLM2CLIP4CXR, a dual-tower framework that couples this encoder with a vision backbone. LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines, handles abbreviations and style variation, and achieves strong clinical alignment on report-level metrics. LLM2CLIP4CXR leverages these embeddings to boost retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores, with stronger cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants. Trained on 1.6M CXR studies from public and private sources with heterogeneous and noisy reports, our models demonstrate that robustness -- not scale alone -- is the key to effective multimodal learning. We release models to support further research in medical image-text representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 2 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[Out-of-Context Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10408v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how large language models (LLMs) reason about memorized knowledge through simple binary relations such as equality ($=$), inequality ($<$), and inclusion ($\subset$). Unlike in-context reasoning, the axioms (e.g., $a < b, b < c$) are only seen during training and not provided in the task prompt (e.g., evaluating $a < c$). The tasks require one or more reasoning steps, and data aggregation from one or more sources, showing performance change with task complexity. We introduce a lightweight technique, out-of-context representation learning, which trains only new token embeddings on axioms and evaluates them on unseen tasks. Across reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity tests, LLMs mostly perform statistically significant better than chance, making the correct answer extractable when testing multiple phrasing variations, but still fall short of consistent reasoning on every single query. Analysis shows that the learned embeddings are organized in structured ways, suggesting real relational understanding. Surprisingly, it also indicates that the core reasoning happens during the training, not inference.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that meaningful structure in the latent space does not emerge naturally. Instead, it must be explicitly induced. We propose a method that aligns representations from different views of the data to align complementary information without inducing false positives. Our experiments show that our proposed self-supervised learning method, Consistent View Alignment, improves performance for downstream tasks, highlighting the critical role of structured view alignment in learning effective representations. Our method achieved first and second place in the MICCAI 2025 SSL3D challenge when using a Primus vision transformer and ResEnc convolutional neural network, respectively.

| **[Self Identity Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18165v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regularization is essential in deep learning to enhance generalization and mitigate overfitting. However, conventional techniques often rely on heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to different network architectures and tasks. We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization. Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods, highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including audio classification and time series anomaly detection.

However, traditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and exhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training framework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing methods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction, prioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation for downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates context-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion pretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional reasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and the results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context autoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving. The code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Music2Palette: Emotion-aligned Color Palette Generation via Cross-Modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04758v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotion alignment between music and palettes is crucial for effective multimedia content, yet misalignment creates confusion that weakens the intended message. However, existing methods often generate only a single dominant color, missing emotion variation. Others rely on indirect mappings through text or images, resulting in the loss of crucial emotion details. To address these challenges, we present Music2Palette, a novel method for emotion-aligned color palette generation via cross-modal representation learning. We first construct MuCED, a dataset of 2,634 expert-validated music-palette pairs aligned through Russell-based emotion vectors. To directly translate music into palettes, we propose a cross-modal representation learning framework with a music encoder and color decoder. We further propose a multi-objective optimization approach that jointly enhances emotion alignment, color diversity, and palette coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current methods in interpreting music emotion and generating attractive and diverse color palettes. Our approach enables applications like music-driven image recoloring, video generating, and data visualization, bridging the gap between auditory and visual emotion experiences.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAMIR, an efficient registration framework via robust feature learning from SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13629v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis. Deformations are often closely related to the morphological characteristics of tissues, making accurate feature extraction crucial. Recent weakly supervised methods improve registration by incorporating anatomical priors such as segmentation masks or landmarks, either as inputs or in the loss function. However, such weak labels are often not readily available, limiting their practical use. Motivated by the strong representation learning ability of visual foundation models, this paper introduces SAMIR, an efficient medical image registration framework that utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance feature extraction. SAM is pretrained on large-scale natural image datasets and can learn robust, general-purpose visual representations. Rather than using raw input images, we design a task-specific adaptation pipeline using SAM's image encoder to extract structure-aware feature embeddings, enabling more accurate modeling of anatomical consistency and deformation patterns. We further design a lightweight 3D head to refine features within the embedding space, adapting to local deformations in medical images. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Feature Consistency Loss to guide coarse-to-fine feature matching and improve anatomical alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAMIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets for both intra-subject cardiac image registration and inter-subject abdomen CT image registration, achieving performance improvements of 2.68% on ACDC and 6.44% on the abdomen dataset. The source code will be publicly available on GitHub following the acceptance of this paper.</p></details> |  |

It enables the integration of previously distinct domains and has become a mainstream trend in today's innovation process. However, accurately measuring technological convergence remains a persistent challenge due to its inherently multidimensional and evolving nature. This study designs an Technological Convergence Index (TCI) that comprehensively measures convergence along two fundamental dimensions: depth and breadth. For depth calculation, we use IPC textual descriptions as the analytical foundation and enhance this assessment by incorporating supplementary patent metadata into a heterogeneous graph structure. This graph is then modeled using Heterogeneous Graph Transformers in combination with Sentence-BERT, enabling a precise representation of knowledge integration across technological boundaries. Complementing this, the breadth dimension captures the diversity of technological fields involved, quantified through the Shannon Diversity Index to measure the variety of technological combinations within patents. Our final TCI is constructed using the Entropy Weight Method, which objectively assigns weights to both dimensions based on their information entropy. To validate our approach, we compare the proposed TCI against established convergence measures, demonstrating its comparative advantages. We further establish empirical reliability through a novel robustness test that regresses TCI against indicators of patent quality. These findings are further substantiated through comprehensive robustness checks. Our multidimensional approach provides valuable practical insights for innovation policy and industry strategies in managing emerging cross-domain technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphUniverse: Enabling Systematic Evaluation of Inductive Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21097v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph, transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure. Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at https://graphuniverse.streamlit.app.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Graph-Transformer Out-of-Distribution Generalization Abilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20575v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID) benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts. Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without specialized DG algorithms (on four out of six benchmarks). Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets, specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Highlighting its model-agnostic design, the method yielded valuable insights into both GT and MPNN backbones and appears well suited for broader DG applications beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[A HyperGraphMamba-Based Multichannel Adaptive Model for ncRNA Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20240v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play pivotal roles in gene expression regulation and the pathogenesis of various diseases. Accurate classification of ncRNAs is essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis. To address existing limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion, we propose HGMamba-ncRNA, a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model, which integrates sequence, secondary structure, and optionally available expression features of ncRNAs to enhance classification performance. Specifically, the sequence of ncRNA is modeled using a parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM architecture (MKC-L) to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies of nucleotides. The structure modality employs a multi-scale graph transformer (MSGraphTransformer) to represent the multi-level topological characteristics of ncRNA secondary structures. The expression modality utilizes a Chebyshev Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CPKAN) to effectively model and interpret high-dimensional expression profiles. Finally, by incorporating virtual nodes to facilitate efficient and comprehensive multimodal interaction, HyperGraphMamba is proposed to adaptively align and integrate multichannel heterogeneous modality features. Experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Extensive empirical studies further confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong transferability, offering a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA functional classification.

| **[Local equivalence of stabilizer states: a graphical characterisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20183v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stabilizer states form a ubiquitous family of quantum states that can be graphically represented through the graph state formalism. A fundamental property of graph states is that applying a local complementation - a well-known and extensively studied graph transformation - results in a graph that represents the same entanglement as the original. In other words, the corresponding graph states are LU-equivalent. This property served as the cornerstone for capturing non-trivial quantum properties in a simple graphical manner, in the study of quantum entanglement but also for developing protocols and models based on graph states and stabilizer states, such as measurement-based quantum computing, secret sharing, error correction, entanglement distribution... However, local complementation fails short to fully characterise entanglement: there exist pairs of graph states that are LU-equivalent but cannot be transformed one into the other using local complementations. Only few is known about the equivalence of graph states beyond local complementation. We introduce a generalisation of local complementation which graphically characterises the LU-equivalence of graph states. We use this characterisation to show the existence of a strict infinite hierarchy of equivalences of graph states. Our approach is based on minimal local sets, which are subsets of vertices that are known to cover any graph, and to be invariant under local complementation and even LU-equivalence. We use these structures to provide a type to each vertex of a graph, leading to a natural standard form in which the LU-equivalence can be exhibited and captured by means of generalised local complementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[IPGPhormer: Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer for Survival Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12381v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological images play an essential role in cancer prognosis, while survival analysis, which integrates computational techniques, can predict critical clinical events such as patient mortality or disease recurrence from whole-slide images (WSIs). Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method, IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology. The code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IPGPhormer-6EEB.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

We present SolarCAST, a causally informed model predicting future global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a target site using only historical GHI from site X and nearby stations S - unlike prior work that relies on sky-camera or satellite imagery requiring specialized hardware and heavy preprocessing. To deliver high accuracy with only public sensor data, SolarCAST models three classes of confounding factors behind X-S correlations using scalable neural components: (i) observable synchronous variables (e.g., time of day, station identity), handled via an embedding module; (ii) latent synchronous factors (e.g., regional weather patterns), captured by a spatio-temporal graph neural network; and (iii) time-lagged influences (e.g., cloud movement across stations), modeled with a gated transformer that learns temporal shifts. It outperforms leading time-series and multimodal baselines across diverse geographical conditions, and achieves a 25.9% error reduction over the top commercial forecaster, Solcast. SolarCAST offers a lightweight, practical, and generalizable solution for localized solar forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2025</p></details> |

The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer, featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping linear complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12694v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural architecture designed for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages with 3 figures and 2 tables, submitted to IEEE for a possible publication</p></details> |
| **[State Space Models over Directed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13735v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed graphs are ubiquitous across numerous domains, where the directionality of edges encodes critical causal dependencies. However, existing GNNs and graph Transformers tailored for directed graphs face two major challenges: (1) effectively capturing long-range causal dependencies derived from directed edges; (2) balancing accuracy and training efficiency when processing large-scale graph datasets. In recent years, state space models (SSMs) have achieved substantial progress in causal sequence tasks, and their variants designed for graphs have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining high efficiency across various graph learning benchmarks. However, existing graph state space models are exclusively designed for undirected graphs, which limits their performance in directed graph learning. To this end, we propose an innovative approach DirEgo2Token which sequentializes directed graphs via k-hop ego graphs. This marks the first systematic extension of state space models to the field of directed graph learning. Building upon this, we develop DirGraphSSM, a novel directed graph neural network architecture that implements state space models on directed graphs via the message-passing mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that DirGraphSSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three representative directed graph learning tasks while attaining competitive performance on two additional tasks with 1.5$\times $ to 2$\times $ training speed improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently undergoing review by IEEE Transactions on Big Data</p></details> |

Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approaches typically formulate ARE as a sequential decision-making problem defined on a collision-free informative graph. However, these methods often demonstrate limited reasoning ability over graph-structured data. Moreover, due to the insufficient consideration of robot motion, the resulting RL policies are generally optimized to minimize travel distance, while neglecting time efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRATE, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approach that leverages a Graph Transformer to effectively capture both local structure patterns and global contextual dependencies of the informative graph, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning capability across the entire environment. In addition, we deploy a Kalman filter to smooth the waypoint outputs, ensuring that the resulting path is kinodynamically feasible for the robot to follow. Experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits better exploration efficiency (up to 21.5% in distance and 21.3% in time to complete exploration) than state-of-the-art conventional and learning-based baselines in various simulation benchmarks. We also validate our planner in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Homophily Booster: Rethinking the Role of Discrete Features on Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12530v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs.</p></details> | 14 pages |

In this work, we design and benchmark an NQS impurity solver for the quantum embedding methods, focusing on the ghost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA) framework. We introduce a graph transformer-based NQS framework able to represent arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and develop an error control mechanism to stabilise iterative updates throughout the quantum embedding loops. We validate the accuracy of our approach with benchmark gGA calculations of the Anderson Lattice Model, yielding results in excellent agreement with the exact diagonalisation impurity solver. Finally, our analysis of the computational budget reveals the method's principal bottleneck to be the high-accuracy sampling of physical observables required by the embedding loop, rather than the NQS variational optimisation, directly highlighting the critical need for more efficient inference techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, and 4 figures.

| **[GTHNA: Local-global Graph Transformer with Memory Reconstruction for Holistic Node Anomaly Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10869v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in graph-structured data is an inherently challenging problem, as it requires the identification of rare nodes that deviate from the majority in both their structural and behavioral characteristics. Existing methods, such as those based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), often suffer from over-smoothing, which causes the learned node representations to become indistinguishable. Furthermore, graph reconstruction-based approaches are vulnerable to anomalous node interference during the reconstruction process, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a novel and holistic anomaly evaluation framework that integrates three key components: a local-global Transformer encoder, a memory-guided reconstruction mechanism, and a multi-scale representation matching strategy. These components work synergistically to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and global structural dependencies, suppress the influence of anomalous nodes, and assess anomalies from multiple levels of granularity. Anomaly scores are computed by combining reconstruction errors and memory matching signals, resulting in a more robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering a comprehensive and generalizable solution for anomaly detection across various graph domains.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Database Views as Explanations for Relational Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09482v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash, Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSRFormer: Road Network Representation Learning using Multi-scale Feature Fusion of Heterogeneous Spatial Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05685v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer, MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections, which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow heterogeneity of spatial interactions.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective cross-lingual generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Found...</summary><p>Found some issues and need to correct them</p></details> |

However, in tasks involving natural language and programming language (NL-PL) artifacts, relying solely on textual similarity is limited by their semantic gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical evaluation across various types of TLR tasks, revealing the limitations of textual similarity in NL-PL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an approach that incorporates multiple domain-specific auxiliary strategies, identified through empirical analysis, into two models: the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via edge types and the prompt-based Gemini 2.5 Pro via additional input information. We then evaluated our approach using the widely studied requirements-to-code TLR task, a representative case of NL-PL TLR. Experimental results show that both the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models outperformed their original counterparts without strategy integration. Furthermore, compared to the current state-of-the-art method HGNNLink, the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models achieved average F1-score improvements of 3.68% and 8.84%, respectively, across twelve open-source projects, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy integration in enhancing overall model performance for the requirements-code TLR task.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 5 images, 11 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Graph Transformer-Based Flood Susceptibility Mapping: Application to the French Riviera and Railway Infrastructure Under Climate Change](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03727v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasing flood frequency and severity due to climate change threatens infrastructure and demands improved susceptibility mapping techniques. While traditional machine learning (ML) approaches are widely used, they struggle to capture spatial dependencies and poor boundary delineation between susceptibility classes. This study introduces the first application of a graph transformer (GT) architecture for flood susceptibility mapping to the flood-prone French Riviera (e.g., 2020 Storm Alex) using topography, hydrology, geography, and environmental data. GT incorporates watershed topology using Laplacian positional encoders (PEs) and attention mechanisms. The developed GT model has an AUC-ROC (0.9739), slightly lower than XGBoost (0.9853). However, the GT model demonstrated better clustering and delineation with a higher Moran's I value (0.6119) compared to the random forest (0.5775) and XGBoost (0.5311) with p-value lower than 0.0001. Feature importance revealed a striking consistency across models, with elevation, slope, distance to channel, and convergence index being the critical factors. Dimensionality reduction on Laplacian PEs revealed partial clusters, indicating they could capture spatial information; however, their importance was lower than flood factors. Since climate and land use changes aggravate flood risk, susceptibility maps are developed for the 2050 year under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and railway track vulnerability is assessed. All RCP scenarios revealed increased area across susceptibility classes, except for the very low category. RCP 8.5 projections indicate that 17.46% of the watershed area and 54% of railway length fall within very-high susceptible zones, compared to 6.19% and 35.61%, respectively, under current conditions. The developed maps can be integrated into a multi-hazard framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained, local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance. Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEN: A Practical Alternative to Graph Transformers for Long-Range Graph Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01233v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) model local relations effectively but struggle to propagate information over long distances. Graph Transformers (GTs) mitigate this via global self-attention, yet their quadratic cost in the number of nodes limits scalability. We propose Graph Elimination Networks (GENs), an MPNN variant that approximates GT-like long-range modeling while maintaining high efficiency. GENs combine edge-wise and hop-wise self-attention in parallel; their multiplicative composition yields an attention kernel separable across edge and hop factors within a bounded K-hop receptive field. To enable hop-wise attention, we introduce the Graph Elimination Algorithm (GEA), which prevents double counting across hops, ensuring that each round injects the k-hop incremental contribution exactly once. Taking differences between successive rounds recovers the k-hop increment and yields disentangled multi-hop features as inputs for hop-wise attention. This preserves clearer structural distinctions across hop distances and enables more faithful modeling of pairwise dependencies between distant nodes within the K-hop neighborhood. On the Long-Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB), GENs outperform strong MPNN baselines by 7.7 and 6.0 percentage points (pp) on PascalVOC-SP and COCO-SP, and achieve performance on par with or better than state-of-the-art Graph Transformers. On OGBN-Products, GENs support full-batch training/inference, while sparse-attention baselines like Exphormer struggle with memory limits under comparable budgets, highlighting GENs as a practical alternative for large, sparse graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inclu...</summary><p>Includes 11 pages of main text and 6 pages of appendices</p></details> |

Integrating graph generation with these instructions is complex, leading most current methods to use molecular sequences with pre-trained large language models. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel framework, named $\textbf{UTGDiff (Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model)}$, which utilizes language models for discrete graph diffusion to generate molecular graphs from instructions. UTGDiff features a unified text-graph transformer as the denoising network, derived from pre-trained language models and minimally modified to process graph data through attention bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that UTGDiff consistently outperforms sequence-based baselines in tasks involving instruction-based molecule generation and editing, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters given an equivalent level of pretraining corpus.

| **[ReHub: Linear Complexity Graph Transformers with Adaptive Hub-Spoke Reassignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01519v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ReHub, a novel graph transformer architecture that achieves linear complexity through an efficient reassignment technique between nodes and virtual nodes. Graph transformers have become increasingly important in graph learning for their ability to utilize long-range node communication explicitly, addressing limitations such as oversmoothing and oversquashing found in message-passing graph networks. However, their dense attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of nodes, limiting their applicability to large-scale graphs. ReHub draws inspiration from the airline industry's hub-and-spoke model, where flights are assigned to optimize operational efficiency. In our approach, graph nodes (spokes) are dynamically reassigned to a fixed number of virtual nodes (hubs) at each model layer. Recent work, Neural Atoms (Li et al., 2024), has demonstrated impressive and consistent improvements over GNN baselines by utilizing such virtual nodes; their findings suggest that the number of hubs strongly influences performance. However, increasing the number of hubs typically raises complexity, requiring a trade-off to maintain linear complexity. Our key insight is that each node only needs to interact with a small subset of hubs to achieve linear complexity, even when the total number of hubs is large. To leverage all hubs without incurring additional computational costs, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive reassignment technique based on hub-hub similarity scores, eliminating the need for expensive node-hub computations. Our experiments on LRGB indicate a consistent improvement in results over the base method, Neural Atoms, while maintaining a linear complexity. Remarkably, our sparse model achieves performance on par with its non-sparse counterpart. Furthermore, ReHub outperforms competitive baselines and consistently ranks among top performers across various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025.

These architectures have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size, adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller. The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while having a similar training speed.

Traditional graph neural networks often struggle to capture long-range dependencies between nodes due to their local structure. Graph transformers overcome this by using attention mechanisms that allow nodes to exchange information globally. However, there are two types of attention in graph transformers: dense and sparse. In this paper, we compare these two attention mechanisms, analyze their trade-offs, and highlight when to use each. We also outline current challenges and problems in designing attention for graph transformers.</p></details> |  |

This enables precise control over both the content and temporal structure of the generated audio. Despite recent progress, existing methods still face inherent trade-offs among accurate temporal localization, open-vocabulary scalability, and practical efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose DegDiT, a novel dynamic event graph-guided diffusion transformer framework for open-vocabulary controllable audio generation. DegDiT encodes the events in the description as structured dynamic graphs. The nodes in each graph are designed to represent three aspects: semantic features, temporal attributes, and inter-event connections. A graph transformer is employed to integrate these nodes and produce contextualized event embeddings that serve as guidance for the diffusion model. To ensure high-quality and diverse training data, we introduce a quality-balanced data selection pipeline that combines hierarchical event annotation with multi-criteria quality scoring, resulting in a curated dataset with semantic diversity. Furthermore, we present consensus preference optimization, facilitating audio generation through consensus among multiple reward signals. Extensive experiments on AudioCondition, DESED, and AudioTime datasets demonstrate that DegDiT achieves state-of-the-art performances across a variety of objective and subjective evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, cross-subject generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to individual variability, cognitive traits, and emotional responses. We propose FreqDGT, a frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer that systematically addresses these limitations through an integrated framework. FreqDGT introduces frequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant frequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic graph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and implements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines hierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to capture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of integrating frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical modeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences.

Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived graph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or anomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805 without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches. With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to 0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a graph neural network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity. Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation. To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently demonstrated remarkable ability to exploit relational structures in biological data, enabling advances in multi-omics integration for cancer subtype classification. Existing approaches often neglect the intricate coupling between heterogeneous omics, limiting their capacity to resolve subtle cancer subtype heterogeneity critical for precision oncology. To address these limitations, we propose a framework named Graph Transformer for Multi-omics Cancer Subtype Classification (GTMancer). This framework builds upon the GNN optimization problem and extends its application to complex multi-omics data. Specifically, our method leverages contrastive learning to embed multi-omics data into a unified semantic space. We unroll the multiplex graph optimization problem in that unified space and introduce dual sets of attention coefficients to capture structural graph priors both within and among multi-omics data. This approach enables global omics information to guide the refining of the representations of individual omics. Empirical experiments on seven real-world cancer datasets demonstrate that GTMancer outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |

While many existing machine learning approaches have shown promise in brain network analysis, they typically suffer from limited interpretability, particularly in extracting meaningful biomarkers from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and establishing clear relationships between imaging features and demographic characteristics. Besides, current graph neural network methodologies face limitations in capturing both local and global functional connectivity patterns while simultaneously achieving theoretically principled multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a unified framework that applies information bottleneck principles to guide both brain connectivity modeling and cross-modal feature integration. This framework comprises two complementary components. The first is the Information Bottleneck Graph Transformer (IBGraphFormer), which combines transformer-based global attention mechanisms with graph neural networks through information bottleneck-guided pooling to identify sufficient biomarkers. The second is the Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (IB-HGAN), which employs meta-path-based heterogeneous graph learning with structural consistency constraints to achieve interpretable fusion of neuroimaging and demographic data. The experimental results demonstrate that I2B-HGNN achieves superior performance in diagnosing NDDs, exhibiting both high classification accuracy and the ability to provide interpretable biomarker identification while effectively analyzing non-imaging data.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose the Contextual Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering. CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram, and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical domains often require specialized language models with stronger contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7% higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented responses in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs.

To effectively model this complex joint distribution, we adopt a factorized approach: first generating a grounded scene graph, followed by image generation conditioned on the generated grounded scene graph. While conditional image generation has been widely explored in the literature, our primary focus is on the generation of grounded scene graphs from noise, which provides efficient and interpretable control over the image generation process. This task requires generating plausible grounded scene graphs with heterogeneous attributes for both nodes (objects) and edges (relations among objects), encompassing continuous attributes (e.g., object bounding boxes) and discrete attributes (e.g., object and relation categories). To address this challenge, we introduce DiffuseSG, a novel diffusion model that jointly models the heterogeneous node and edge attributes. We explore different encoding strategies to effectively handle the categorical data. Leveraging a graph transformer as the denoiser, DiffuseSG progressively refines grounded scene graph representations in a continuous space before discretizing them to generate structured outputs. Additionally, we introduce an IoU-based regularization term to enhance empirical performance. Our model outperforms existing methods in grounded scene graph generation on the VG and COCO-Stuff datasets, excelling in both standard and newly introduced metrics that more accurately capture the task's complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the broader applicability of DiffuseSG in two important downstream tasks: 1) achieving superior results in a range of grounded scene graph completion tasks, and 2) enhancing grounded scene graph detection models by leveraging additional training samples generated by DiffuseSG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expressive Power of Graph Transformers via Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01067v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers are the basis of modern large language models, but relatively little is known about their precise expressive power on graphs. We study the expressive power of graph transformers (GTs) by Dwivedi and Bresson (2020) and GPS-networks by Ramp\'asek et al. (2022), both under soft-attention and average hard-attention. Our study covers two scenarios: the theoretical setting with real numbers and the more practical case with floats. With reals, we show that in restriction to vertex properties definable in first-order logic (FO), GPS-networks have the same expressive power as graded modal logic (GML) with the global modality. With floats, GPS-networks turn out to be equally expressive as GML with the counting global modality. The latter result is absolute, not restricting to properties definable in a background logic. We also obtain similar characterizations for GTs in terms of propositional logic with the global modality (for reals) and the counting global modality (for floats).</p></details> |  |
| **[Invariant Graph Transformer for Out-of-Distribution Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00304v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated great effectiveness across various graph analytical tasks. However, the existing GTs focus on training and testing graph data originated from the same distribution, but fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Graph invariant learning, aiming to capture generalizable graph structural patterns with labels under distribution shifts, is potentially a promising solution, but how to design attention mechanisms and positional and structural encodings (PSEs) based on graph invariant learning principles remains challenging. To solve these challenges, we introduce Graph Out-Of-Distribution generalized Transformer (GOODFormer), aiming to learn generalized graph representations by capturing invariant relationships between predictive graph structures and labels through jointly optimizing three modules. Specifically, we first develop a GT-based entropy-guided invariant subgraph disentangler to separate invariant and variant subgraphs while preserving the sharpness of the attention function. Next, we design an evolving subgraph positional and structural encoder to effectively and efficiently capture the encoding information of dynamically changing subgraphs during training. Finally, we propose an invariant learning module utilizing subgraph node representations and encodings to derive generalizable graph representations that can to unseen graphs. We also provide theoretical justifications for our method. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using weakest application conditions to rank graph transformations for graph repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08788v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When using graphs and graph transformations to model systems, consistency is an important concern. While consistency has primarily been viewed as a binary property, i.e., a graph is consistent or inconsistent with respect to a set of constraints, recent work has presented an approach to consistency as a graduated property. This allows living with inconsistencies for a while and repairing them when necessary. For repairing inconsistencies in a graph, we use graph transformation rules with so-called {\em impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions} to understand how much repair gain certain rule applications would bring. Both types of conditions can be derived from given graph constraints. Our main theorem shows that the difference between the number of actual constraint violations before and after a graph transformation step can be characterized by the difference between the numbers of violated impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions. This theory forms the basis for algorithms with look-ahead that rank graph transformations according to their potential for graph repair. An evaluation shows that graph repair can be well supported by rules with these new types of application conditions in terms of effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 25 Figures, new, more efficient method for constructing application conditions, theoretical comparison to other concepts of consistency, extended evaluation</p></details> |
| **[WOCD: A Semi-Supervised Method for Overlapping Community Detection Using Weak Cliques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00927v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Overlapping community detection (OCD) is a fundamental graph data analysis task for extracting graph patterns. Traditional OCD methods can be broadly divided into node clustering and link clustering approaches, both of which rely solely on link information to identify overlapping communities. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have made significant advancements for this task. However, existing GNN-based approaches often face difficulties in effectively integrating link, attribute, and prior information, along with challenges like limited receptive fields and over-smoothing, which hinder their performance on complex overlapping community detection. In this paper, we propose a Weak-clique based Overlapping Community Detection method, namely WOCD, which incorporates prior information and optimizes the use of link information to improve detection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce pseudo-labels within a semi-supervised framework to strengthen the generalization ability, making WOCD more versatile. Furthermore, we initialize pseudo-labels using weak cliques to fully leverage link and prior information, leading to better detection accuracy. Additionally, we employ a single-layer Graph Transformer combined with GNN, which achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining efficiency. We evaluate WOCD on eight real-world attributed datasets, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised OCD method by a significant margin in terms of accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Obfuscation: Cluster-Aware Graph with LLM-Aided Recovery for Malicious JavaScript Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22447v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid expansion of web-based applications and cloud services, malicious JavaScript code continues to pose significant threats to user privacy, system integrity, and enterprise security. But, detecting such threats remains challenging due to sophisticated code obfuscation techniques and JavaScript's inherent language characteristics, particularly its nested closure structures and syntactic flexibility. In this work, we propose DeCoda, a hybrid defense framework that combines large language model (LLM)-based deobfuscation with code graph learning: (1) We first construct a sophisticated prompt-learning pipeline with multi-stage refinement, where the LLM progressively reconstructs the original code structure from obfuscated inputs and then generates normalized Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representations; (2) In JavaScript ASTs, dynamic typing scatters semantically similar nodes while deeply nested functions fracture scope capturing, introducing structural noise and semantic ambiguity. To address these challenges, we then propose to learn hierarchical code graph representations via a Cluster-wise Graph that synergistically integrates graph transformer network, node clustering, and node-to-cluster attention to simultaneously capture both local node-level semantics and global cluster-induced structural relationships from AST graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves F1-scores of 94.64% and 97.71% on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating absolute improvements of 10.74% and 13.85% over state-of-the-art baselines. In false-positive control evaluation at fixed FPR levels (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01), our approach delivers 4.82, 5.91, and 2.53 higher TPR respectively compared to the best-performing baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-based deobfuscation and underscore the importance of modeling cluster-level relationships in detecting malicious code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rule-Based Graph Programs Matching the Time Complexity of Imperative Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09144v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on recent advances in rule-based graph programming, which allow us to match the time complexity of some fundamental imperative graph algorithms. In general, achieving the time complexity of graph algorithms implemented in conventional languages using a rule-based graph-transformation language is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be implemented in the graph programming language GP 2 such that their runtime matches the time complexity of imperative implementations. However, this required input graphs to have a bounded node degree and (for some algorithms) to be connected. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies: the first program checks whether input graphs are connected, the second program checks whether input graphs are acyclic, and the third program solves the single-source shortest-paths problem for graphs with integer edge-weights. The first two programs run in linear time on (possibly disconnected) input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. The third program runs in time $O(nm)$ on arbitrary input graphs, matching the time complexity of imperative implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. For each program, we formally prove its correctness and time complexity, and provide runtime experiments on various graph classes.</p></details> |  |

This study systematically benchmarked classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN)) for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data. This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version; a revised version will be uploaded later</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Grained Temporal-Spatial Graph Learning for Stable Traffic Flow Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00884v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-evolving traffic flow forecasting are playing a vital role in intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. However, the dynamic traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various real-world traffic networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network for Attributed Graph Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13620v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, models based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have made significant strides in the field of graph data analysis. However, challenges such as over-smoothing and over-compression remain when handling large-scale and complex graph datasets, leading to a decline in clustering quality. Although the Graph Transformer architecture has mitigated some of these issues, its performance is still limited when processing heterogeneous graph data. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep clustering framework that comprising GCN, Autoencoder (AE), and Graph Transformer, termed the Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network (Tri-GFN). This framework enhances the differentiation and consistency of global and local information through a unique tri-learning mechanism and feature fusion enhancement strategy. The framework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer modules. These components are meticulously fused by a triple-channel enhancement module, which maximizes the use of both node attributes and topological structures, ensuring robust clustering representation. The tri-learning mechanism allows mutual learning among these modules, while the feature fusion strategy enables the model to capture complex relationships, yielding highly discriminative representations for graph clustering. It surpasses many state-of-the-art methods, achieving an accuracy improvement of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14 % on the Reuters dataset, and 7.58 % on the USPS dataset. Due to its outstanding performance on the Reuters dataset, Tri-GFN can be applied to automatic news classification, topic retrieval, and related fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code for this study is available at https://github.com/YF-W/Tri-GFN</p></details> |

Here, we propose MGT, a multi-view graph transformer framework that synergistically fuses SE3 invariant and SO3 equivariant graph representations, which respectively captures rotation-translation invariance and rotation equivariance in crystal geometries. To strategically incorporate these complementary geometric representations, we employ a lightweight mixture of experts router in MGT to adaptively adjust the weight assigned to SE3 and SO3 embeddings based on the specific target task. Compared with previous state-of-the-art models, MGT reduces the mean absolute error by up to 21% on crystal property prediction tasks through multi-task self-supervised pretraining. Ablation experiments and interpretable investigations confirm the effectiveness of each technique implemented in our framework. Additionally, in transfer learning scenarios including crystal catalyst adsorption energy and hybrid perovskite bandgap prediction, MGT achieves performance improvements of up to 58% over existing baselines, demonstrating domain-agnostic scalability across diverse application domains. As evidenced by the above series of studies, we believe that MGT can serve as useful model for crystal material property prediction, providing a valuable tool for the discovery of novel materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taint Analysis for Graph APIs Focusing on Broken Access Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08947v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis for Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes in the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use critical pair analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the CPA is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>Intermediate preprint (revision #1) for submission to ICGT 24 Special Issue in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |

While it conventionally relies on meticulous feature engineering, deep learning techniques have recently shown a great promise in learning effective player and team representations directly for soccer outcome prediction. However, existing methods often overlook the heterogeneous nature of interactions among players and teams, which is crucial for accurately modeling match dynamics. To address this gap, we propose HIGFormer (Heterogeneous Interaction Graph Transformer), a novel graph-augmented transformer-based deep learning model for soccer outcome prediction. HIGFormer introduces a multi-level interaction framework that captures both fine-grained player dynamics and high-level team interactions. Specifically, it comprises (1) a Player Interaction Network, which encodes player performance through heterogeneous interaction graphs, combining local graph convolutions with a global graph-augmented transformer; (2) a Team Interaction Network, which constructs interaction graphs from a team-to-team perspective to model historical match relationships; and (3) a Match Comparison Transformer, which jointly analyzes both team and player-level information to predict match outcomes. Extensive experiments on the WyScout Open Access Dataset, a large-scale real-world soccer dataset, demonstrate that HIGFormer significantly outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we provide valuable insights into leveraging our model for player performance evaluation, offering a new perspective on talent scouting and team strategy analysis.</p></details> |  |

These changes are inherently discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete spaces for reaction prediction.</p></details> | 22pages, 2 figures |

Experimental evaluation on radargram data from the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks, including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture long-range dependencies.

We prepend a lightweight Riemannian mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold, mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure. These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space. Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured. Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making graph representations more interpretable.</p></details> |  |

However, training deep learning models for AMS designs is severely limited by the scarcity of integrated circuit design data. In this work, we present CircuitGPS, a few-shot learning method for parasitic effect prediction in AMS circuits. The circuit netlist is represented as a heterogeneous graph, with the coupling capacitance modeled as a link. CircuitGPS is pre-trained on link prediction and fine-tuned on edge regression. The proposed method starts with a small-hop sampling technique that converts a link or a node into a subgraph. Then, the subgraph embeddings are learned with a hybrid graph Transformer. Additionally, CircuitGPS integrates a low-cost positional encoding that summarizes the positional and structural information of the sampled subgraph. CircuitGPS improves the accuracy of coupling existence by at least 20\% and reduces the MAE of capacitance estimation by at least 0.067 compared to existing methods. Our method demonstrates strong inherent scalability, enabling direct application to diverse AMS circuit designs through zero-shot learning.

Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork) framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2) spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries. Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods address structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However, this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student" prediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature data into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion. Experimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior performance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer and decouples dynamic-static objects optimization for 3D Gaussian Splatting-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarsegrained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. On the other hand, we decouple dynamic and static objects by leveraging semantic probability distributions and design a Dynamic-Static Decoupled Gaussian Attention mechanism to optimize the prediction performance for both dynamic objects and static scenes. GraphGSOcc achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, OpenOcc and KITTI occupancy benchmarks. Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 25.20%, reducing GPU memory to 6.8 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld.</p></details> |  |

(1993) is known to yield strong solutions, both in theory and practice. To obtain guarantees in more general settings, recent approximations typically abandon this simplicity and practicality. Still, so far, there is no known non-trivial approximation algorithm for the spanner problem in its most general form. We provide two surprisingly simple approximations algorithms. In general, our Augmented Greedy achieves the first unconditional approximation ratio of m, which is non-trivial due to the independence of weights and lengths. Crucially, it maintains all size and weight guarantees Greedy is known for, i.e., in the aforementioned multiplicative alpha-spanner scenario and even for additive +beta-spanners. Further, it generalizes some of these size guarantees to derive new weight guarantees. Our second approach, Randomized Rounding, establishes a graph transformation that allows a simple rounding scheme over a standard multicommodity flow LP. It yields an O(n log n)-approximation, assuming integer lengths and polynomially bounded distance demands. The only other known approximation guarantee in this general setting requires several complex subalgorithms and analyses, yet we match it up to a factor of O(n^{1/5-eps}) using standard tools. Further, on bounded-degree graphs, we yield the first O(log n) approximation ratio for constant-bounded distance demands (beyond multiplicative 2-spanners in unit-length graphs).</p></details> |  |
| **[FoGE: Fock Space inspired encoding for graph prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02937v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based structures effortlessly.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study of Dynamic Stock Relationship Modeling and S&P500 Price Forecasting Based on Differential Graph Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18717v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock price prediction is vital for investment decisions and risk management, yet remains challenging due to markets' nonlinear dynamics and time-varying inter-stock correlations. Traditional static-correlation models fail to capture evolving stock relationships. To address this, we propose a Differential Graph Transformer (DGT) framework for dynamic relationship modeling and price prediction. Our DGT integrates sequential graph structure changes into multi-head self-attention via a differential graph mechanism, adaptively preserving high-value connections while suppressing noise. Causal temporal attention captures global/local dependencies in price sequences. We further evaluate correlation metrics (Pearson, Mutual Information, Spearman, Kendall's Tau) across global/local/dual scopes as spatial-attention priors. Using 10 years of S&P 500 closing prices (z-score normalized; 64-day sliding windows), DGT with spatial priors outperformed GRU baselines (RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87). Kendall's Tau global matrices yielded optimal results (MAE: 0.11). K-means clustering revealed "high-volatility growth" and "defensive blue-chip" stocks, with the latter showing lower errors (RMSE: 0.13) due to stable correlations. Kendall's Tau and Mutual Information excelled in volatile sectors. This study innovatively combines differential graph structures with Transformers, validating dynamic relationship modeling and identifying optimal correlation metrics/scopes. Clustering analysis supports tailored quantitative strategies. Our framework advances financial time-series prediction through dynamic modeling and cross-asset interaction analysis.</p></details> |  |

We introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight, parameter-efficient foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being pre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong multimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a unified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models structural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph transformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful, modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification, prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our model revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a unique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration). BrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can surpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and powerful research in computational neuroscience.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

For non-Euclidean data, e.g., graphs, that particularly involves topological structures, one important aspect neglected by prior studies is how machine learning models generalize under topological shifts. This paper proposes Advective Diffusion Transformer (AdvDIFFormer), a physics-inspired graph Transformer model designed to address this challenge. The model is derived from advective diffusion equations which describe a class of continuous message passing process with observed and latent topological structures. We show that AdvDIFFormer has provable capability for controlling generalization error with topological shifts, which in contrast cannot be guaranteed by graph diffusion models, i.e., the generalized formulation of common graph neural networks in continuous space. Empirically, the model demonstrates superiority in various predictive tasks across information networks, molecular screening and protein interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient Few-shot Graph Neural Architecture Search via Partitioning Gradient Contribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01231v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the weight coupling problem, certain studies introduced few-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, which partition the supernet into multiple sub-supernets. However, these methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules. Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Representation Learning with Mutual Influence of Modalities for Node Classification in Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07895v3)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities. Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal data, especially when accompanied with network structures.</p></details> |  |

We propose Pieceformer, a scalable, self-supervised similarity assessment framework, equipped with a hybrid message-passing and graph transformer encoder. To address transformer scalability, we incorporate a linear transformer backbone and introduce a partitioned training pipeline for efficient memory and parallelism management. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world CircuitNet datasets show that Pieceformer reduces mean absolute error (MAE) by 24.9% over the baseline and is the only method to correctly cluster all real-world design groups. We further demonstrate the practical usage of our model through a case study on a partitioning task, achieving up to 89% runtime reduction. These results validate the framework's effectiveness for scalable, unbiased design reuse in modern VLSI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, submitted</p></details> |

GITO consists of two main modules: a hybrid graph transformer (HGT) and a transformer neural operator (TNO). HGT leverages a graph neural network (GNN) to encode local spatial relationships and a transformer to capture long-range dependencies. A self-attention fusion layer integrates the outputs of the GNN and transformer to enable more expressive feature learning on graph-structured data. TNO module employs linear-complexity cross-attention and self-attention layers to map encoded input functions to predictions at arbitrary query locations, ensuring discretization invariance and enabling zero-shot super-resolution across any mesh. Empirical results on benchmark PDE tasks demonstrate that GITO outperforms existing transformer-based neural operators, paving the way for efficient, mesh-agnostic surrogate solvers in engineering applications.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that, by effectively encoding ego-graphs (1-hop neighbourhoods), we can reduce the reliance on resource-intensive textual encoders. This makes the model both fast at training and inference time, as well as frugal in terms of cost. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on three popular datasets and show that FnF-TG can achieve superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. We also extend inductive learning to a fully inductive setting, where relations don't rely on transductive (fixed) representations, as in previous work, but are a function of their textual description. Additionally, we introduce new variants of existing datasets, specifically designed to test the performance of models on unseen relations at inference time, thus offering a new test-bench for fully inductive link prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[H$^2$GFM: Towards unifying Homogeneity and Heterogeneity on Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08298v2)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing interests and applications of graph learning in diverse domains have propelled the development of a unified model generalizing well across different graphs and tasks, known as the Graph Foundation Model (GFM). Existing research has leveraged text-attributed graphs (TAGs) to tackle the heterogeneity in node features among graphs. However, they primarily focus on homogeneous TAGs (HoTAGs), leaving heterogeneous TAGs (HeTAGs), where multiple types of nodes/edges reside, underexplored. To enhance the capabilities and applications of GFM, we introduce H$^2$GFM, a novel framework designed to generalize across both HoTAGs and HeTAGs. Our model projects diverse meta-relations among graphs under a unified textual space, and employs a context encoding to capture spatial and higher-order semantic relationships. To achieve robust node representations, we propose a novel context-adaptive graph transformer (CGT), effectively capturing information from both context neighbors and their relationships. Furthermore, we employ a mixture of CGT experts to capture the heterogeneity in structural patterns among graph types. Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of HoTAGs and HeTAGs as well as learning scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEIST: A Graph Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics and Proteomics Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11152v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell transcriptomics has become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional regulation at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial transcriptomics data we have the promise of learning about cells within a tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and transcriptomic readouts. However, existing models either ignore spatial resolution or the gene regulatory information. Gene regulation in cells can change depending on microenvironmental cues from neighboring cells, but existing models neglect gene regulatory patterns with hierarchical dependencies across levels of abstraction. In order to create contextualized representations of cells and genes from spatial transcriptomics data, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer-based foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data. HEIST models tissue as spatial cellular neighborhood graphs, and each cell is, in turn, modeled as a gene regulatory network graph. The framework includes a hierarchical graph transformer that performs cross-level message passing and message passing within levels. HEIST is pre-trained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive learning and masked auto-encoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST representations of cells, shows that it effectively encodes the microenvironmental influences in cell embeddings, enabling the discovery of spatially-informed subpopulations that prior models fail to differentiate. Further, HEIST achieves state-of-the-art results on four downstream task such as clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, gene imputation, and spatially-informed cell clustering across multiple technologies, highlighting the importance of hierarchical modeling and GRN-based representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Efficient and Generalizable Graph Retriever for Knowledge-Graph Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09645v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong inductive reasoning ability across various domains, but their reliability is hindered by the outdated knowledge and hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these issues by grounding LLMs with external knowledge; however, most existing RAG pipelines rely on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and structured reasoning. Knowledge graphs, which represent facts as relational triples, offer a more structured and compact alternative. Recent studies have explored integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), with a significant proportion adopting the retrieve-then-reasoning paradigm. In this framework, graph-based retrievers have demonstrated strong empirical performance, yet they still face challenges in generalization ability. In this work, we propose RAPL, a novel framework for efficient and effective graph retrieval in KGQA. RAPL addresses these limitations through three aspects: (1) a two-stage labeling strategy that combines heuristic signals with parametric models to provide causally grounded supervision; (2) a model-agnostic graph transformation approach to capture both intra- and inter-triple interactions, thereby enhancing representational capacity; and (3) a path-based reasoning strategy that facilitates learning from the injected rational knowledge, and supports downstream reasoner through structured inputs. Empirically, RAPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by $2.66\%-20.34\%$, and significantly reduces the performance gap between smaller and more powerful LLM-based reasoners, as well as the gap under cross-dataset settings, highlighting its superior retrieval capability and generalizability.

| **[Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding for Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08309v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However, the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies. Also, L-STEP obtains the leading performance in the newest large-scale TGB benchmark.

| **[HGFormer: A Hierarchical Graph Transformer Framework for Two-Stage Colonel Blotto Games via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08580v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-stage Colonel Blotto game represents a typical adversarial resource allocation problem, in which two opposing agents sequentially allocate resources in a network topology across two phases: an initial resource deployment followed by multiple rounds of dynamic reallocation adjustments. The sequential dependency between game stages and the complex constraints imposed by the graph topology make it difficult for traditional approaches to attain a globally optimal strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical graph Transformer framework called HGformer. By incorporating an enhanced graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent hierarchical decision model, our approach enables efficient policy generation in large-scale adversarial environments. Moreover, we design a layer-by-layer feedback reinforcement learning algorithm that feeds the long-term returns from lower-level decisions back into the optimization of the higher-level strategy, thus bridging the coordination gap between the two decision-making stages. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing hierarchical decision-making or graph neural network methods, HGformer significantly improves resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, achieving superior overall performance in complex dynamic game scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We present the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a hybrid graph-based architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention mechanism into the message-passing framework for structured language modeling. The attention mechanism is implemented using parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), which enable the model to capture rich contextual relationships while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to classical attention mechanisms. We evaluate QGT on five sentiment classification benchmarks. Experimental results show that QGT consistently achieves higher or comparable accuracy than existing quantum natural language processing (QNLP) models, including both attention-based and non-attention-based approaches. When compared with an equivalent classical graph transformer, QGT yields an average accuracy improvement of 5.42% on real-world datasets and 4.76% on synthetic datasets. Additionally, QGT demonstrates improved sample efficiency, requiring nearly 50% fewer labeled samples to reach comparable performance on the Yelp dataset. These results highlight the potential of graph-based QNLP techniques for advancing efficient and scalable language understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Return of ChebNet: Understanding and Improving an Overlooked GNN on Long Range Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07624v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ChebNet, one of the earliest spectral GNNs, has largely been overshadowed by Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), which gained popularity for their simplicity and effectiveness in capturing local graph structure. Despite their success, MPNNs are limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies between nodes. This has led researchers to adapt MPNNs through rewiring or make use of Graph Transformers, which compromises the computational efficiency that characterized early spatial message-passing architectures, and typically disregards the graph structure. Almost a decade after its original introduction, we revisit ChebNet to shed light on its ability to model distant node interactions. We find that out-of-box, ChebNet already shows competitive advantages relative to classical MPNNs and GTs on long-range benchmarks, while maintaining good scalability properties for high-order polynomials. However, we uncover that this polynomial expansion leads ChebNet to an unstable regime during training. To address this limitation, we cast ChebNet as a stable and non-dissipative dynamical system, which we coin Stable-ChebNet. Our Stable-ChebNet model allows for stable information propagation, and has controllable dynamics which do not require the use of eigendecompositions, positional encodings, or graph rewiring. Across several benchmarks, Stable-ChebNet achieves near state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

First, we propose GET, which combines a standard transformer encoder or decoder architecture with an innovative graph-to-sequence transformation method. This method converts graphs or sampled subgraphs into sequences of tokens representing nodes, edges, and attributes in a reversible manner using Eulerian paths. We pre-train GET using either of the two self-supervised tasks: next-token prediction (NTP) and scheduled masked-token prediction (SMTP). The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as graph-, edge-, and node-level prediction. Despite its simplicity, GraphGPT achieves performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods on multiple large-scale Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets. It demonstrates exceptional results on the molecular property prediction dataset PCQM4Mv2 and the protein-protein interaction dataset ogbl-ppa. Notably, generative pre-training enables scaling GraphGPT to 2 billion parameters while maintaining performance gains - a breakthrough that overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and prior graph transformers (GTs). To advance research in graph foundation models and facilitate scientific discovery in chemistry, materials science, and related fields, we will release the source code (https://github.com/alibaba/graph-gpt) and pre-trained checkpoints.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Spectral Graph Neural Networks are Incomplete on Graphs with a Simple Spectrum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05530v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet, these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on graphs from ZINC.</p></details> | 9 pages main text |

By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel. Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training and evaluating existing GTs.

Usually, action coordination is represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA) module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these Transformer-based DGNNs vary significantly, highlighting the importance of properly defining the SAM on dynamic graphs and comprehensively encoding temporal and interactive dynamics without extra complex modules. In this work, we propose TIDFormer, a dynamic graph TransFormer that fully exploits Temporal and Interactive Dynamics in an efficient manner. We clarify and verify the interpretability of our proposed SAM, addressing the open problem of its uninterpretable definitions on dynamic graphs in previous works. To model the temporal and interactive dynamics, respectively, we utilize the calendar-based time partitioning information and extract informative interaction embeddings for both bipartite and non-bipartite graphs using merely the sampled first-order neighbors. In addition, we jointly model temporal and interactive features by capturing potential changes in historical interaction patterns through a simple decomposition. We conduct extensive experiments on several dynamic graph datasets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of TIDFormer. The experimental results demonstrate that TIDFormer excels, outperforming state-of-the-art models across most datasets and experimental settings. Furthermore, TIDFormer exhibits significant efficiency advantages compared to previous Transformer-based methods.</p></details> | KDD2025 |

Recently, random walk structural encoding (RWSE) has been found to further enhance their predictive power by encoding both structural and positional information into the edge representation. However, RWSE cannot always distinguish between edges that belong to different local graph patterns, which reduces its ability to capture the full structural complexity of graphs. This work introduces Simple Path Structural Encoding (SPSE), a novel method that utilizes simple path counts for edge encoding. We show theoretically and experimentally that SPSE overcomes the limitations of RWSE, providing a richer representation of graph structures, particularly for capturing local cyclic patterns. To make SPSE computationally tractable, we propose an efficient approximate algorithm for simple path counting. SPSE demonstrates significant performance improvements over RWSE on various benchmarks, including molecular and long-range graph datasets, achieving statistically significant gains in discriminative tasks. These results pose SPSE as a powerful edge encoding alternative for enhancing the expressivity of graph transformers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Classic GNNs Be Strong Baselines for Graph-level Tasks? Simple Architectures Meet Excellence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09263v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often criticized for their limited expressiveness, issues like over-smoothing and over-squashing, and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies. Conversely, Graph Transformers (GTs) are regarded as superior due to their employment of global attention mechanisms, which potentially mitigate these challenges. Literature frequently suggests that GTs outperform GNNs in graph-level tasks, especially for graph classification and regression on small molecular graphs. In this study, we explore the untapped potential of GNNs through an enhanced framework, GNN+, which integrates six widely used techniques: edge feature integration, normalization, dropout, residual connections, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding, to effectively tackle graph-level tasks. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of three classic GNNs (GCN, GIN, and GatedGCN) enhanced by the GNN+ framework across 14 well-known graph-level datasets. Our results reveal that, contrary to prevailing beliefs, these classic GNNs consistently match or surpass the performance of GTs, securing top-three rankings across all datasets and achieving first place in eight. Furthermore, they demonstrate greater efficiency, running several times faster than GTs on many datasets. This highlights the potential of simple GNN architectures, challenging the notion that complex mechanisms in GTs are essential for superior graph-level performance.

However, integrating the vital structural information of KGs into Large Language Models (LLMs) and outputting predictions deterministically remains challenging. To address this, we propose a new method called GLTW, which encodes the structural information of KGs and merges it with LLMs to enhance KGC performance. Specifically, we introduce an improved Graph Transformer (iGT) that effectively encodes subgraphs with both local and global structural information and inherits the characteristics of language model, bypassing training from scratch. Also, we develop a subgraph-based multi-classification training objective, using all entities within KG as classification objects, to boost learning efficiency.Importantly, we combine iGT with an LLM that takes KG language prompts as input.Our extensive experiments on various KG datasets show that GLTW achieves significant performance gains compared to SOTA baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025(Findings)</p></details> |

We address the task of extracting clinical events and their temporal relations using the well-studied I2B2 2012 Temporal Relations Challenge corpus. This task is inherently challenging due to complex clinical language, long documents, and sparse annotations. We introduce GRAPHTREX, a novel method integrating span-based entity-relation extraction, clinical large pre-trained language models (LPLMs), and Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) to capture local and global dependencies. Our HGT component facilitates information propagation across the document through innovative global landmarks that bridge distant entities. Our method improves the state-of-the-art with 5.5% improvement in the tempeval $F_1$ score over the previous best and up to 8.9% improvement on long-range relations, which presents a formidable challenge. We further demonstrate generalizability by establishing a strong baseline on the E3C corpus. This work not only advances temporal information extraction but also lays the groundwork for improved diagnostic and prognostic models through enhanced temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Intro...</summary><p>Introducing a novel method for joint extraction of medical events and temporal relations from free-text, leveraging clinical LPLMs and Heterogeneous Graph Transformers, achieving a 5.5% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art and up to 8.9% on long-range relations</p></details> |
| **[GrokFormer: Graph Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17296v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in graph representation learning over popular graph neural networks (GNNs). However, self--attention, the core module of GTs, preserves only low-frequency signals in graph features, leading to ineffectiveness in capturing other important signals like high-frequency ones. Some recent GT models help alleviate this issue, but their flexibility and expressiveness are still limited since the filters they learn are fixed on predefined graph spectrum or spectral order. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Graph Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (GrokFormer), a novel GT model that learns highly expressive spectral filters with adaptive graph spectrum and spectral order through a Fourier series modeling over learnable activation functions. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the proposed GrokFormer filter offers better expressiveness than other spectral methods. Comprehensive experiments on 10 real-world node classification datasets across various domains, scales, and graph properties, as well as 5 graph classification datasets, show that GrokFormer outperforms state-of-the-art GTs and GNNs.

| **[Message-Passing GNNs Fail to Approximate Sparse Triangular Factorizations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01397v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been proposed as a tool for learning sparse matrix preconditioners, which are key components in accelerating linear solvers. This position paper argues that message-passing GNNs are fundamentally incapable of approximating sparse triangular factorizations. We demonstrate that message-passing GNNs fundamentally fail to approximate sparse triangular factorizations for classes of matrices for which high-quality preconditioners exist but require non-local dependencies. To illustrate this, we construct a set of baselines using both synthetic matrices and real-world examples from the SuiteSparse collection. Across a range of GNN architectures, including Graph Attention Networks and Graph Transformers, we observe severe performance degradation compared to exact or K-optimal factorizations, with cosine similarity dropping below $0.6$ in key cases. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest that architectural innovations beyond message-passing are necessary for applying GNNs to scientific computing tasks such as matrix factorization. Experiments demonstrate that overcoming non-locality alone is insufficient. Tailored architectures are necessary to capture the required dependencies since even a completely non-local Graph Transformer fails to match the proposed baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[EGGs are adhesive!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13678v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of rewriting-based visual formalisms is on the rise. In the formal methods community, this is due also to the introduction of adhesive categories, where most properties of classical approaches to graph transformation, such as those on parallelism and confluence, can be rephrased and proved in a general and uniform way.E-graphs (EGGs) are a formalism for program optimisation via an efficient implementation of equality saturation. In short, EGGs can be defined as (acyclic) term graphs with an additional notion of equivalence on nodes that is closed under the operators of the signature. Instead of replacing the components of a program, the optimisation step is performed by adding new components and linking them to the existing ones via an equivalence relation, until an optimal program is reached. This work describes EGGs via adhesive categories. Besides the benefits in itself of a formal presentation, which renders the properties of the data structure precise, the description of the addition of equivalent program components using standard graph transformation tools offers the advantages of the adhesive framework in modelling, for example, concurrent updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Graph Prompt Work? A Data Operation Perspective with Theoretical Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01635v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph prompting has emerged as a promising research direction, enabling the learning of additional tokens or subgraphs appended to the original graphs without requiring retraining of pre-trained graph models across various applications. This novel paradigm, shifting from the traditional pretraining and finetuning to pretraining and prompting has shown significant empirical success in simulating graph data operations, with applications ranging from recommendation systems to biological networks and graph transferring. However, despite its potential, the theoretical underpinnings of graph prompting remain underexplored, raising critical questions about its fundamental effectiveness. The lack of rigorous theoretical proof of why and how much it works is more like a dark cloud over the graph prompt area to go further. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework that rigorously analyzes graph prompting from a data operation perspective. Our contributions are threefold: First, we provide a formal guarantee theorem, demonstrating graph prompts capacity to approximate graph transformation operators, effectively linking upstream and downstream tasks. Second, we derive upper bounds on the error of these data operations by graph prompts for a single graph and extend this discussion to batches of graphs, which are common in graph model training. Third, we analyze the distribution of data operation errors, extending our theoretical findings from linear graph models (e.g., GCN) to non-linear graph models (e.g., GAT). Extensive experiments support our theoretical results and confirm the practical implications of these guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Target Specific De Novo Design of Drug Candidate Molecules with Graph Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07868v7)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering novel drug candidate molecules is one of the most fundamental and critical steps in drug development. Generative deep learning models, which create synthetic data given a probability distribution, offer a high potential for designing de novo molecules. However, to be utilisable in real life drug development pipelines, these models should be able to design drug like and target centric molecules. In this study, we propose an end to end generative system, DrugGEN, for the de novo design of drug candidate molecules that interact with intended target proteins. The proposed method represents molecules as graphs and processes them via a generative adversarial network comprising graph transformer layers. The system is trained using a large dataset of drug like compounds and target specific bioactive molecules to design effective inhibitory molecules against the AKT1 protein, which is critically important in developing treatments for various types of cancer. We conducted molecular docking and dynamics to assess the target centric generation performance of the model, as well as attention score visualisation to examine model interpretability. In parallel, selected compounds were chemically synthesised and evaluated in the context of in vitro enzymatic assays, which identified two bioactive molecules that inhibited AKT1 at low micromolar concentrations. These results indicate that DrugGEN's de novo molecules have a high potential for interacting with the AKT1 protein at the level of its native ligands. Using the open access DrugGEN codebase, it is possible to easily train models for other druggable proteins, given a dataset of experimentally known bioactive molecules.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAM-GT: Dual Positional Encoding-Based Attention Masking Graph Transformer for Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17660v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neighborhood-aware tokenized graph Transformers have recently shown great potential for node classification tasks. Despite their effectiveness, our in-depth analysis of neighborhood tokens reveals two critical limitations in the existing paradigm. First, current neighborhood token generation methods fail to adequately capture attribute correlations within a neighborhood. Second, the conventional self-attention mechanism suffers from attention diversion when processing neighborhood tokens, where high-hop neighborhoods receive disproportionate focus, severely disrupting information interactions between the target node and its neighborhood tokens. To address these challenges, we propose DAM-GT, Dual positional encoding-based Attention Masking graph Transformer. DAM-GT introduces a novel dual positional encoding scheme that incorporates attribute-aware encoding via an attribute clustering strategy, effectively preserving node correlations in both topological and attribute spaces. In addition, DAM-GT formulates a new attention mechanism with a simple yet effective masking strategy to guide interactions between target nodes and their neighborhood tokens, overcoming the issue of attention diversion. Extensive experiments on various graphs with different homophily levels as well as different scales demonstrate that DAM-GT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification tasks.</p></details> | Preprint version |
| **[A Network Science Approach to Granular Time Series Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17640v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series segmentation (TSS) is one of the time series (TS) analysis techniques, that has received considerably less attention compared to other TS related tasks. In recent years, deep learning architectures have been introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of various TS- to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d) demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the required training data compared to the baseline methods.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Plain Transformers Can be Powerful Graph Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12588v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities, owing to their simple but powerful scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph Transformers (GTs) have strayed far from plain Transformers, exhibiting major architectural differences either by integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention mechanisms. These divergences hinder the easy adoption of training advances for Transformers developed in other domains. Contrary to previous GTs, this work demonstrates that the plain Transformer architecture can be a powerful graph learner. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate three simple, minimal, and easy-to-implement modifications to the plain Transformer architecture to construct our Powerful Plain Graph Transformers (PPGT): (1) simplified $L_2$ attention for measuring the magnitude closeness among tokens; (2) adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude information; and (3) a simple MLP-based stem for graph positional encoding. Consistent with its theoretical expressivity, PPGT demonstrates noteworthy realized expressivity on the empirical graph expressivity benchmark, comparing favorably to more complicated competitors such as subgraph GNNs and higher-order GNNs. Its outstanding empirical performance across various graph datasets also justifies the practical effectiveness of PPGT.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models face significant challenges in scaling to large circuits due to limitations like over-squashing in graph neural networks and the quadratic complexity of transformer-based models. To address these issues, we introduce DeepGate4, a scalable and efficient graph transformer specifically designed for large-scale circuits. DeepGate4 incorporates several key innovations: (1) an update strategy tailored for circuit graphs, which reduce memory complexity to sub-linear and is adaptable to any graph transformer; (2) a GAT-based sparse transformer with global and local structural encodings for AIGs; and (3) an inference acceleration CUDA kernel that fully exploit the unique sparsity patterns of AIGs. Our extensive experiments on the ITC99 and EPFL benchmarks show that DeepGate4 significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15.5% and 31.1% performance improvements over the next-best models. Furthermore, the Fused-DeepGate4 variant reduces runtime by 35.1% and memory usage by 46.8%, making it highly efficient for large-scale circuit analysis. These results demonstrate the potential of DeepGate4 to handle complex EDA tasks while offering superior scalability and efficiency.

We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise, contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions, activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their representational structure is consistent across model families and scales. These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct, independently steerable representations.</p></details> |  |

While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees. We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO (single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Centric Elastic Pipeline Parallelism for Efficient Long-Context LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21275v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long context training is crucial for LLM's context extension. Existing schemes, such as sequence parallelism, incur substantial communication overhead. Pipeline parallelism (PP) reduces this cost, but its effectiveness hinges on partitioning granularity. Batch-level PP dividing input samples exhibits high memory consumption in long-context scenario, whereas token-level PP splitting sequences into slices alleviates memory overhead but may incur hardware under-utilization. This trade-off motivates adaptively selecting PP granularity to match resource and workload characteristics. Moreover, sequence length distribution of the real-world dataset exhibits skewness, posing a challenge on PP's workload balance and efficient scheduling. Current static PP scheduling methods overlook the variance of sequence length, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Elastic Pipeline Parallelism (EPP) that orchestrates token-level PP and batch-level PP to adapt to resource and workload heterogeneity. We build InfiniPipe, a distributed training system that unleashes the potential of EPP via (1) a resource-aware and workload-balanced sequence processor that splits long sequences and packs short ones; and (2) a co-optimization methodology that jointly optimizes pipeline schedule and gradient checkpointing via a mechanism named stage-aware chunk-level adaptive checkpointing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that InfiniPipe achieves a 1.69x speedup over state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> |  |

These Superchips employ a tightly coupled heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package, which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently. SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems, enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of 13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while achieving 55% MFU.</p></details> | 16 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Semantic Edge-Cloud Communication for Real-Time Urban Traffic Surveillance with ViT and LLMs over Mobile Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21259v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle trajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs) using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9% reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic surveillance.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |

However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge. This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer (CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts. This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Tree Search for LLM Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21240v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge, we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based RL method.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Do LLM Agents Do When Left Alone? Evidence of Spontaneous Meta-Cognitive Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21224v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior, establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Fano-Style Accuracy Upper Bound for LLM Single-Pass Reasoning in Multi-Hop QA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21199v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed, interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable. Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods: \faGithub \href{https://github.com/KaiyangWan/InfoQA}{InfoQA}.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |

However, these capabilities are still limited compared to human-level cognition because they are heavily influenced by the training data. Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved performance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared to human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code review to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is hampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models. This paper contributes MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought (COT) fine-tuning approach that trains LLMs with an impressive reasoning ability to analyze multiple dimensions of code review by harnessing long COT techniques to provide rich structured information. To address context loss and reasoning logic loss issues that frequently occur when LLMs process long COT prompts, we propose a solution that combines the Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling principle with pre-defined reasoning pathways in MelcotCR to enable more effective utilization of in-context knowledge within long COT prompts while strengthening the logical tightness of the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations on our curated MelcotCR dataset and the public CodeReviewer dataset reveal that a low-parameter base model, such as 14B Qwen2.5, fine-tuned with MelcotCR can surpass state-of-the-art methods in terms of the accuracy of detecting and describing code issues, with its performance remarkably on par with that of the 671B DeepSeek-R1 model.</p></details> | 22 pages |

Toward understanding underlying causes, we propose a novel theoretical framework that reframes the unlearning process as backdoor attacks and defenses: forget-tokens act as backdoor triggers that, when activated in retain-queries, cause disruptions in unlearned models' behaviors, similar to successful backdoor attacks. The sense that, LLM unlearning methods themselves poison the model, make it more vulnerable to forget-tokens, and hide rather than erase target knowledge, describes their true mechanism. To mitigate the vulnerability caused by the forgetting process, we reinterpret the retaining process as a backdoor defense and propose Random Noise Augmentation (RNA), a lightweight, model and method-agnostic approach with theoretical guarantees for improving the robustness of models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RNA significantly improves the robustness of unlearned models while preserving forget and retain performances. This backdoor attack-defense framework offers insights into the mechanism of unlearning that can shed light on future research directions for improving unlearning robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 13 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[ToMPO: Training LLM Strategic Decision Making from a Multi-Agent Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21134v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose **T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18% improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |
| **[RL Squeezes, SFT Expands: A Comparative Study of Reasoning LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21128v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains). Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs, and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories, whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens (about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training, with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for data construction and more efficient learning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[InComeS: Integrating Compression and Selection Mechanisms into LLMs for Efficient Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22156v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although existing model editing methods perform well in recalling exact edit facts, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require deeper semantic understanding rather than mere knowledge regurgitation. Leveraging the strong contextual reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) becomes a promising editing method by comprehending edit information through context encoding. However, this method is constrained by the limited context window of LLMs, leading to degraded performance and efficiency as the number of edits increases. To overcome this limitation, we propose InComeS, a flexible framework that enhances LLMs' ability to process editing contexts through explicit compression and selection mechanisms. Specifically, InComeS compresses each editing context into the key-value (KV) cache of a special gist token, enabling efficient handling of multiple edits without being restricted by the model's context window. Furthermore, specialized cross-attention modules are added to dynamically select the most relevant information from the gist pools, enabling adaptive and effective utilization of edit information. We conduct experiments on diverse model editing benchmarks with various editing formats, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</p></details> | 18 pages,5 figures |
| **[TrustJudge: Inconsistencies of LLM-as-a-Judge and How to Alleviate Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21117v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1) Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1) distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment. The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without requiring additional training or human annotations.

| **[United Minds or Isolated Agents? Exploring Coordination of LLMs under Cognitive Load Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06843v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a notable performance ceiling on complex, multi-faceted tasks, as they often fail to integrate diverse information or adhere to multiple constraints. We posit that such limitation arises when the demands of a task exceed the LLM's effective cognitive load capacity. This interpretation draws a strong analogy to Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) in cognitive science, which explains similar performance boundaries in the human mind, and is further supported by emerging evidence that reveals LLMs have bounded working memory characteristics. Building upon this CLT-grounded understanding, we introduce CoThinker, a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework designed to mitigate cognitive overload and enhance collaborative problem-solving abilities. CoThinker operationalizes CLT principles by distributing intrinsic cognitive load through agent specialization and managing transactional load via structured communication and a collective working memory. We empirically validate CoThinker on complex problem-solving tasks and fabricated high cognitive load scenarios, demonstrating improvements over existing multi-agent baselines in solution quality and efficiency. Our analysis reveals characteristic interaction patterns, providing insights into the emergence of collective cognition and effective load management, thus offering a principled approach to overcoming LLM performance ceilings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Which Cultural Lens Do Models Adopt? On Cultural Positioning Bias and Agentic Mitigation in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21080v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000 generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10 diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2 inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent) introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines. (2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for mitigating biases in generative LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Injection Attacks on LLM Generated Reviews of Scientific Publications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10248v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ongoing intense discussion on rising LLM usage in the scientific peer-review process has recently been mingled by reports of authors using hidden prompt injections to manipulate review scores. Since the existence of such "attacks" - although seen by some commentators as "self-defense" - would have a great impact on the further debate, this paper investigates the practicability and technical success of the described manipulations. Our systematic evaluation uses 1k reviews of 2024 ICLR papers generated by a wide range of LLMs shows two distinct results: I) very simple prompt injections are indeed highly effective, reaching up to 100% acceptance scores. II) LLM reviews are generally biased toward acceptance (>95% in many models). Both results have great impact on the ongoing discussions on LLM usage in peer-review.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the Exploration Bottleneck: Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning for General LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16949v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the Best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500, surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading LLMs including OpenAI-o3.

| **[JudgeAgent: Knowledge-wise and Dynamic LLM Evaluation with Agent-as-Interviewer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02097v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current evaluation paradigms for large language models (LLMs) suffer from overestimated or biased evaluation and mismatched question difficulty, leading to incomplete evaluations of LLM's knowledge and capability boundaries, which hinder LLM's effective application and optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-as-Interviewer, a dynamic evaluation paradigm that employs LLM agents to conduct multi-turn interactions for evaluation. Unlike current benchmarking or dynamic interaction paradigms, Agent-as-Interviewer utilizes agents to call knowledge tools for wider and deeper knowledge in the dynamic multi-turn question generation, achieving more complete evaluations of the LLM's knowledge boundaries. It also leverages agents to plan query strategies for adjustment of the question difficulty levels, enhancing the difficulty control to match the actual capabilities of target LLMs. Based on this paradigm, we develop JudgeAgent, a knowledge-wise dynamic evaluation framework that employs knowledge-driven synthesis as the agent's tool, and uses difficulty scoring as strategy guidance, thereby finally providing valuable suggestions to help targets optimize themselves. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of JudgeAgent's suggestions, demonstrating that Agent-as-Interviewer can accurately identify the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models.

| **[When Instructions Multiply: Measuring and Estimating LLM Capabilities of Multiple Instructions Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21051v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval (ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error, even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction combinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP2025</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Enhances Activation Intensity and Diversity in the Internal Circuitry of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21044v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training: (i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based approaches.

| **[Problem Solved? Information Extraction Design Space for Layout-Rich Documents using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18179v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper defines and explores the design space for information extraction (IE) from layout-rich documents using large language models (LLMs). The three core challenges of layout-aware IE with LLMs are 1) data structuring, 2) model engagement, and 3) output refinement. Our study investigates the sub-problems and methods within these core challenges, such as input representation, chunking, prompting, selection of LLMs, and multimodal models. It examines the effect of different design choices through LayIE-LLM, a new, open-source, layout-aware IE test suite, benchmarking against traditional, fine-tuned IE models. The results on two IE datasets show that LLMs require adjustment of the IE pipeline to achieve competitive performance: the optimized configuration found with LayIE-LLM achieves 13.3--37.5 F1 points more than a general-practice baseline configuration using the same LLM. To find a well-working configuration, we develop a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method that achieves near-optimal results. Our method is only 0.8--1.8 points lower than the best full factorial exploration with a fraction (2.8%) of the required computation. Overall, we demonstrate that, if well-configured, general-purpose LLMs match the performance of specialized models, providing a cost-effective, finetuning-free alternative. Our test-suite is available at https://github.com/gayecolakoglu/LayIE-LLM.</p></details> | accepted at EMNLP'25 |
| **[DELTA-Code: How Does RL Unlock and Transfer New Programming Algorithms in LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21016v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability -- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability, we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory, compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer. Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Red Teaming LLM-based Agents with Model Context Protocol Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21011v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) has led to the wide application of LLM-based agents in various domains. To standardize interactions between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP) tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents. Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms, thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan - a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like distance travel, providing more efficient path planning. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics.

| **[RL of Thoughts: Navigating LLM Reasoning with Inference-time Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14140v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), the token-level autoregressive nature constrains their complex reasoning capabilities. To enhance LLM reasoning, inference-time techniques, including Chain/Tree/Graph-of-Thought(s), successfully improve the performance, as they are fairly cost-effective by guiding reasoning through sophisticated logical structures without modifying LLMs' parameters. However, these manually predefined, task-agnostic frameworks are applied uniformly across diverse tasks, lacking adaptability. To improve this, we propose RL-of-Thoughts (RLoT), where we train a lightweight navigator model with reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively enhance LLM reasoning at inference time. Specifically, we design five basic logic blocks from the perspective of human cognition. During the reasoning process, the trained RL navigator dynamically selects the suitable logic blocks and combines them into task-specific logical structures according to problem characteristics. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH, GPQA, etc.) with multiple LLMs (GPT, Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek) illustrate that RLoT outperforms established inference-time techniques by up to 13.4%. Remarkably, with less than 3K parameters, our RL navigator is able to make sub-10B LLMs comparable to 100B-scale counterparts. Moreover, the RL navigator demonstrates strong transferability: a model trained on one specific LLM-task pair can effectively generalize to unseen LLMs and tasks.

| **[Runtime-Adaptive Pruning for LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17138v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding and generation, but their enormous computational and memory requirements hinder deployment. Compression offers a potential solution to mitigate these constraints. However, most existing methods rely on fixed heuristics and thus fail to adapt to runtime memory variations or heterogeneous KV-cache demands arising from diverse user requests. To address these limitations, we propose RAP, an elastic pruning framework driven by reinforcement learning (RL) that dynamically adjusts compression strategies in a runtime-aware manner. Specifically, RAP dynamically tracks the evolving ratio between model parameters and KV-cache across practical execution. Recognizing that FFNs house most parameters, whereas parameter -light attention layers dominate KV-cache formation, the RL agent retains only those components that maximize utility within the current memory budget, conditioned on instantaneous workload and device state. Extensive experiments results demonstrate that RAP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, marking the first time to jointly consider model weights and KV-cache on the fly.</p></details> |  |

Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.</p></details> | 34 pages, 21 figures |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been explored for HPT, yet most rely on models exceeding 100 billion parameters. We propose an Expert Block Framework for HPT using Small LLMs. At its core is the Trajectory Context Summarizer (TCS), a deterministic block that transforms raw training trajectories into structured context, enabling small LLMs to analyze optimization progress with reliability comparable to larger models. Using two locally-run LLMs (phi4:reasoning14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) and a 10-trial budget, our TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9 percentage points of GPT-4 across six diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis of instruction-based LLMs' capabilities to score and judge text-input problems in an academic setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20982v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education, LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score; Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLUE: Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20977v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned, they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions, risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and retain utility through precise neural localization.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[TestAgent: Automatic Benchmarking and Exploratory Interaction for Evaluating LLMs in Vertical Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11507v5)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in highly specialized vertical domains, the evaluation of their domain-specific performance becomes critical. However, existing evaluations for vertical domains typically rely on the labor-intensive construction of static single-turn datasets, which present two key limitations: (i) manual data construction is costly and must be repeated for each new domain, and (ii) static single-turn evaluations are misaligned with the dynamic multi-turn interactions in real-world applications, limiting the assessment of professionalism and stability. To address these, we propose TestAgent, a framework for automatic benchmarking and exploratory dynamic evaluation in vertical domains. TestAgent leverages retrieval-augmented generation to create domain-specific questions from user-provided knowledge sources, combined with a two-stage criteria generation process, thereby enabling scalable and automated benchmark creation. Furthermore, it introduces a reinforcement learning-guided multi-turn interaction strategy that adaptively determines question types based on real-time model responses, dynamically probing knowledge boundaries and stability. Extensive experiments across medical, legal, and governmental domains demonstrate that TestAgent enables efficient cross-domain benchmark generation and yields deeper insights into model behavior through dynamic exploratory evaluation. This work establishes a new paradigm for automated and in-depth evaluation of LLMs in vertical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Wang ...</summary><p>Wang et al. Copyright 2026 lEEE.

However, public cloud providers often struggle to provide performance guarantees for serverless LLM serving due to significant cold start latency caused by substantial model sizes and complex runtime dependencies. To address this problem, we present HydraServe, a serverless LLM serving system designed to minimize cold start latency in public clouds. HydraServe proactively distributes models across servers to quickly fetch them, and overlaps cold-start stages within workers to reduce startup latency. Additionally, HydraServe strategically places workers across GPUs to avoid network contention among cold-start instances. To minimize resource consumption during cold starts, HydraServe further introduces pipeline consolidation that can merge groups of workers into individual serving endpoints. Our comprehensive evaluations under diverse settings demonstrate that HydraServe reduces the cold start latency by 1.7$\times$-- 4.7$\times$ and improves service level objective attainment by 1.43$\times$--1.74$\times$ compared to baselines.</p></details> | Accepted by NSDI'26 |
| **[Tool Calling for Arabic LLMs: Data Strategies and Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20957v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic) tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.</p></details> |  |

Star ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques -- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers -- struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for presentation at ACS/IEEE 22nd International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA 2025)</p></details> |

In this paper, we argue that existing evaluations are not sufficiently adversarial, obscuring critical vulnerabilities and overstating the security. To address this, we introduce adaptive robustness radius, a formal metric that quantifies watermark resilience against adaptive adversaries. We theoretically prove that optimizing the attack context and model parameters can substantially reduce this radius, making watermarks highly susceptible to paraphrase attacks. Leveraging this insight, we propose RLCracker, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive attack that erases watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity. RLCracker requires only limited watermarked examples and zero access to the detector. Despite weak supervision, it empowers a 3B model to achieve 98.5% removal success and an average 0.92 P-SP score on 1,500-token Unigram-marked texts after training on only 100 short samples. This performance dramatically exceeds 6.75% by GPT-4o and generalizes across five model sizes over ten watermarking schemes. Our results confirm that adaptive attacks are broadly effective and pose a fundamental threat to current watermarking defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Entropy Control in LLM-RL Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03493v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits. AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection) to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit ``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>20pag...</summary><p>20pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Verification Limits Code LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20837v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification, we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.</p></details> |  |

Multi-floor environments pose unique challenges including cross-floor transitions and vertical spatial reasoning, especially navigating unknown buildings. Object-Goal Navigation benchmarks like HM3D and MP3D also capture this multi-floor reality, yet current methods lack support for online, floor-aware navigation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{\textit{ASCENT}}, an online framework for Zero-Shot Object-Goal Navigation that enables robots to operate without pre-built maps or retraining on new object categories. It introduces: (1) a \textbf{Multi-Floor Abstraction} module that dynamically constructs hierarchical representations with stair-aware obstacle mapping and cross-floor topology modeling, and (2) a \textbf{Coarse-to-Fine Reasoning} module that combines frontier ranking with LLM-driven contextual analysis for multi-floor navigation decisions. We evaluate on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art zero-shot approaches, and demonstrate real-world deployment on a quadruped robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 9 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables; Project Page at https://zeying-gong.github.io/projects/ascent</p></details> |

They achieve high precision at the cost of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical error correction.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA). We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs) and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs, scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives. Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art performance.

Recent LLM-TTS systems achieve strong controllability and zero-shot generalization, but their large parameter counts and high latency limit real-world deployment. SPADE addresses this by combining (i) a pruning step guided by a word-error-rate-based layer importance index to remove non-essential Transformer layers, with (ii) multi-level knowledge distillation to restore autoregressive coherence. On zero-shot benchmarks, SPADE preserves near-parity perceptual quality while halving Transformer depth, reducing VRAM usage by up to 20%, and achieving up to 1.7x faster real-time factor with less than 5% of the original training data. These results show that compact LLM-TTS models can maintain naturalness and speaker similarity while enabling practical real-time speech generation.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction. However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1) coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning, then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.</p></details> | under review |

We introduce Bias Similarity Measurement (BSM), which treats fairness as a relational property between models, unifying scalar, distributional, behavioral, and representational signals into a single similarity space. Evaluating 30 LLMs on 1M+ prompts, we find that instruction tuning primarily enforces abstention rather than altering internal representations; small models gain little accuracy and can become less fair under forced choice; and open-weight models can match or exceed proprietary systems. Family signatures diverge: Gemma favors refusal, LLaMA 3.1 approaches neutrality with fewer refusals, and converges toward abstention-heavy behavior overall. Counterintuitively, Gemma 3 Instruct matches GPT-4-level fairness at far lower cost, whereas Gemini's heavy abstention suppresses utility. Beyond these findings, BSM offers an auditing workflow for procurement, regression testing, and lineage screening, and extends naturally to code and multilingual settings. Our results reframe fairness not as isolated scores but as comparative bias similarity, enabling systematic auditing of LLM ecosystems.

Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware. This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and scalability across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose LM-Searcher, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for cross-domain neural architecture optimization without the need for extensive domain-specific adaptation. Central to our approach is NCode, a universal numerical string representation for neural architectures, which enables cross-domain architecture encoding and search. We also reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select high-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning samples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs, encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain (e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search. The datasets and models will be released at https://github.com/Ashone3/LM-Searcher.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Main |
| **[LoRA is All You Need for Safety Alignment of Reasoning LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17075v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning LLMs have demonstrated remarkable breakthroughs in solving complex problems that were previously out of reach. To ensure LLMs do not assist with harmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the post-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the "Safety Tax". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning capabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding show that this approach produces highly safe LLMs--with safety levels comparable to full-model fine-tuning--without compromising their reasoning abilities. Our ablation studies further identify three key factors in LoRA: (1) rank-$1$ updates are sufficient to achieve the best reasoning and safety performance, (2) the up projection layers are the most critical modules, with LoRA applied to them alone achieving even better results, and (3) middle layers are more effective than early or late layers. Together, these findings show that strong safety and reasoning can be achieved at minimal computational cost when updates are applied in the right places. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with smaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. Finally, while our attempts to further reduce this overlap yield only modest improvements on some tasks, they highlight the potential of developing methods that more reliably optimize the reasoning-safety tradeoff.</p></details> |  |
| **[SFT Doesn't Always Hurt General Capabilities: Revisiting Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20758v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss, including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i) using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.</p></details> |  |

While many methods are available to generate conditions with acceptable performance, a universal approach for reliably discovering effective conditions during reaction exploration is rare. Consequently, current reaction optimization processes are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly, relying heavily on trial-and-error experimentation. Nowadays, large language models (LLMs) are capable of tackling chemistry-related problems, such as molecule design and chemical reasoning tasks. Here, we report the design, implementation and application of Chemma-RC, a text-augmented multimodal LLM to identify effective conditions through task-specific dialogue and condition generation. Chemma-RC learns a unified representation of chemical reactions by aligning multiple modalities-including text corpus, reaction SMILES, and reaction graphs-within a shared embedding module. Performance benchmarking on datasets showed high precision in identifying optimal conditions, with up to 17% improvement over the current state-of-the-art methods. A palladium-catalysed imidazole C-H arylation reaction was investigated experimentally to evaluate the functionalities of the Chemma-RC in practice. Our findings suggest that Chemma-RC holds significant potential to accelerate high-throughput condition screening in chemical synthesis.</p></details> |  |

However, the evolving nature of such dynamic dialogues makes it challenging to anticipate emerging vulnerabilities and design effective defenses. To tackle this problem, we present a search-based framework that alternates between improving attack and defense strategies through the simulation of privacy-critical agent interactions. Specifically, we employ LLMs as optimizers to analyze simulation trajectories and iteratively propose new agent instructions. To explore the strategy space more efficiently, we further utilize parallel search with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation. Through this process, we find that attack strategies escalate from direct requests to sophisticated tactics, such as impersonation and consent forgery, while defenses evolve from simple rule-based constraints to robust identity-verification state machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse scenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for building privacy-aware agents.</p></details> | Preprint |

Current prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated inferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD) framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390 real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs (Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with gains up to 22.3% (MACD). On the subset of the data, it achieves performance on par with or exceeding that of human physicians (up to 16% improvement over physicians-only diagnosis). Additionally, on the MACD-human workflow, it achieves an 18.6% improvement compared to physicians-only diagnosis. Moreover, self-learned knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability, and model-specific personalization, while the system can generate traceable rationales, enhancing explainability. Consequently, this work presents a scalable self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis, bridging the gap between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs and real-world clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Replication to Redesign: Exploring Pairwise Comparisons for LLM-Based Peer Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11343v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities to reimagine peer review beyond the constraints of traditional workflows. Despite these opportunities, prior efforts have largely focused on replicating traditional review workflows with LLMs serving as direct substitutes for human reviewers, while limited attention has been given to exploring new paradigms that fundamentally rethink how LLMs can participate in the academic review process. In this paper, we introduce and explore a novel mechanism that employs LLM agents to perform pairwise comparisons among manuscripts instead of individual scoring. By aggregating outcomes from substantial pairwise evaluations, this approach enables a more accurate and robust measure of relative manuscript quality. Our experiments demonstrate that this comparative approach significantly outperforms traditional rating-based methods in identifying high-impact papers. However, our analysis also reveals emergent biases in the selection process, notably a reduced novelty in research topics and an increased institutional imbalance. These findings highlight both the transformative potential of rethinking peer review with LLMs and critical challenges that future systems must address to ensure equity and diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoPASTA: 7K Preference Pairs That Matter for Video-LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14096v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-language models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding video content but struggle with spatial relationships, temporal ordering, and cross-frame continuity. To address these limitations, we introduce VideoPASTA (Preference Alignment with Spatio-Temporal-Cross Frame Adversaries), a framework that enhances Video-LLMs through targeted preference optimization. VideoPASTA trains models to distinguish accurate video representations from carefully crafted adversarial examples that deliberately violate spatial, temporal, or cross-frame relationships. With only 7,020 preference pairs and Direct Preference Optimization, VideoPASTA enables models to learn robust representations that capture fine-grained spatial details and long-range temporal dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that VideoPASTA is model agnostic and significantly improves performance, for example, achieving gains of up to +3.8 percentage points on LongVideoBench, +4.1 on VideoMME, and +4.0 on MVBench, when applied to various state-of-the-art Video-LLMs. These results demonstrate that targeted alignment, rather than massive pretraining or architectural modifications, effectively addresses core video-language challenges. Notably, VideoPASTA achieves these improvements without any human annotation or captioning, relying solely on 32-frame sampling. This efficiency makes our approach a scalable plug-and-play solution that seamlessly integrates with existing models while preserving their original capabilities.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 (Main) |
| **[Incorporating LLM Embeddings for Variation Across the Human Genome](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20702v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language model (LLM) embeddings have enabled powerful representations for biological data, but most applications to date focus only on gene-level information. We present one of the first systematic frameworks to generate variant-level embeddings across the entire human genome. Using curated annotations from FAVOR, ClinVar, and the GWAS Catalog, we constructed semantic text descriptions for 8.9 billion possible variants and generated embeddings at three scales: 1.5 million HapMap3+MEGA variants, ~90 million imputed UK Biobank variants, and ~9 billion all possible variants. Embeddings were produced with both OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large and the open-source Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B models. Baseline experiments demonstrate high predictive accuracy for variant properties, validating the embeddings as structured representations of genomic variation. We outline two downstream applications: embedding-informed hypothesis testing by extending the Frequentist And Bayesian framework to genome-wide association studies, and embedding-augmented genetic risk prediction that enhances standard polygenic risk scores. These resources, publicly available on Hugging Face, provide a foundation for advancing large-scale genomic discovery and precision medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Reward Scaling for LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18991v5)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment is vital for safely deploying large language models (LLMs). Existing techniques are either reward-based (train a reward model on preference pairs and optimize with reinforcement learning) or reward-free (directly fine-tune on ranked outputs). Recent research shows that well-tuned reward-based pipelines remain robust, and single-response demonstrations can outperform pairwise preference data. However, two challenges persist: (1) imbalanced safety datasets that overrepresent common hazards while neglecting long-tail threats; and (2) static reward models that ignore task difficulty, limiting optimization efficiency and attainable gains. We propose DR-IRL (Dynamically adjusting Rewards through Inverse Reinforcement Learning). We first train category-specific reward models using a balanced safety dataset covering seven harmful categories via IRL. Then we enhance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by introducing dynamic reward scaling--adjusting rewards by task difficulty--data-level hardness by text encoder cosine similarity, model-level responsiveness by reward gaps. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that DR-IRL outperforms all baseline methods in safety alignment while maintaining usefulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning, and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment.

| **[Can Federated Learning Safeguard Private Data in LLM Training? Vulnerabilities, Attacks, and Defense Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20680v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains. Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers can still extract training data from the global model, even using straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL, including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 32 figures, accepted to the Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

This paper investigates this issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low, models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in explainable AI and audio.</p></details> |  |

The prediction accuracy is 30\% higher with embedding vectors than with only pre-entry covariates. However, since the text embedding vectors are high-dimensional, we perform Zero-Shot classification of these texts to a low-dimensional vector of user-defined classes to aid interpretation while retaining the predictive power. To shed light on the social dynamics inside the correctional facilities, we estimate peer effects in these LLM-generated numerical representations of language with a multivariate peer effect model, adjusting for network endogeneity. We develop new methodology and theory for peer effect estimation that accommodate sparse networks, multivariate latent variables, and correlated multivariate outcomes. With these new methods, we find significant peer effects in language usage for interaction and feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Task Reasoning LLM Agents for Multi-turn Task Planning via Single-turn Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20616v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler subtasks.</p></details> |  |

This creates barriers for lay users to easily manage their networks without resorting to experts. With recent development of powerful large language models (LLMs) for language comprehension, we design a system to make network management accessible to a broader audience of non-experts by allowing users to converse with networks in natural language. To effectively leverage advancements in LLMs, we propose an agentic framework that uses an intermediate representation to streamline configuration across diverse vendor equipment, retrieves the network state from memory in real-time, and provides an interface for external feedback. We also conduct pilot studies to collect real user data of natural language utterances for network control, and present a visualization interface to facilitate dialogue-driven user interaction and enable large-scale data collection for future development. Preliminary experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed system components with LLM integration on both synthetic and real user utterances. Through our data collection and visualization efforts, we pave the way for more effective use of LLMs and democratize network control for everyday users.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

To bridge this gap, we propose a new evaluation task for temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues and introduce an approach to construct a new benchmark by augmenting dialogues from LoCoMo and creating multi-choice QAs. Furthermore, we present TReMu, a new framework aimed at enhancing the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLM-agents in this context. Specifically, the framework employs time-aware memorization through timeline summarization, generating retrievable memory by summarizing events in each dialogue session with their inferred dates. Additionally, we integrate neuro-symbolic temporal reasoning, where LLMs generate Python code to perform temporal calculations and select answers. Experimental evaluations on popular LLMs demonstrate that our benchmark is challenging, and the proposed framework significantly improves temporal reasoning performance compared to baseline methods, raising from 29.83 on GPT-4o via standard prompting to 77.67 via our approach and highlighting its effectiveness in addressing temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Most users simply want factually correct, safe, and satisfying responses without concerning themselves with model technicalities, while inference service providers prioritize minimizing operating costs. These competing interests are typically mediated through service level agreements (SLAs) that guarantee minimum service quality. We introduce MESS+, a stochastic optimization algorithm for cost-optimal LLM request routing while providing rigorous SLA compliance guarantees. MESS+ learns request satisfaction probabilities of LLMs in real-time as users interact with the system, based on which model selection decisions are made by solving a per-request optimization problem. Our algorithm includes a novel combination of virtual queues and request satisfaction prediction, along with a theoretical analysis of cost optimality and constraint satisfaction. Across a wide range of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, MESS+ achieves an average of $2\times$ cost savings compared to existing LLM routing techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods (code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by 19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy. Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and to provide insights for its practical application.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARS: toward more efficient multi-agent collaboration for LLM reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20502v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision. This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%.

Yet these integrations bring their own form of self-admitted technical debt (SATD). In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of LLM-specific SATD: its origins, prevalence, and mitigation strategies. By analyzing 93,142 Python files across major LLM APIs, we found that 54.49% of SATD instances stem from OpenAI integrations and 12.35% from LangChain use. Prompt design emerged as the primary source of LLM-specific SATD, with 6.61% of debt related to prompt configuration and optimization issues, followed by hyperparameter tuning and LLM-framework integration. We further explored which prompt techniques attract the most debt, revealing that instruction-based prompts (38.60%) and few-shot prompts (18.13%) are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence on instruction clarity and example quality. Finally, we release a comprehensive SATD dataset to support reproducibility and offer practical guidance for managing technical debt in LLM-powered systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Proceedings of the 2025 Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE '25)</p></details> |

We introduce TactfulToM, a novel English benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand white lies within real-life conversations and reason about prosocial motivations behind them, particularly when they are used to spare others' feelings and maintain social harmony. Our benchmark is generated through a multi-stage human-in-the-loop pipeline where LLMs expand manually designed seed stories into conversations to maintain the information asymmetry between participants necessary for authentic white lies. We show that TactfulToM is challenging for state-of-the-art models, which perform substantially below humans, revealing shortcomings in their ability to fully comprehend the ToM reasoning that enables true understanding of white lies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

We introduce DRES (Disfluency Removal Evaluation Suite), a controlled text-level benchmark that establishes a reproducible semantic upper bound for this task. DRES builds on human-annotated Switchboard transcripts, isolating disfluency removal from ASR errors and acoustic variability. We systematically evaluate proprietary and open-source LLMs across scales, prompting strategies, and architectures. Our results reveal that (i) simple segmentation consistently improves performance, even for long-context models; (ii) reasoning-oriented models tend to over-delete fluent tokens; and (iii) fine-tuning achieves near state-of-the-art precision and recall but harms generalization abilities. We further present a set of LLM-specific error modes and offer nine practical recommendations (R1-R9) for deploying disfluency removal in speech-driven pipelines. DRES provides a reproducible, model-agnostic foundation for advancing robust spoken-language systems.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities to incorporate personas to AI-based tutors and support dynamic interactive dialogue. This paper explores how DHH learners interact with LLM-powered AI tutors with different experiences in DHH education as personas to identify their accessibility preferences. A user study with 16 DHH participants showed that they asked DHH-related questions based on background information and evaluated the AI tutors' cultural knowledge of the DHH communities in their responses. Participants suggested providing more transparency in each AI tutor's position within the DHH community. Participants also pointed out the lack of support in the multimodality of sign language in current LLMs. We discuss design implications to support the diverse needs in interaction between DHH users and the LLMs, such as offering supports in tuning language styles of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We argue that without tight objectives and verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped, reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks. We release our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/judgment-to-noise-947D/README.md</p></details> |  |

However, their limitations - especially those stemming from prompt design - remain underexplored. Because users may supply biased or incomplete prompts - often unintentionally - LLMs can be misled, undermining reliability and creating risks. We refer to this vulnerability as the Instruction Boundary. To investigate the phenomenon, we distill it into eight concrete facets and introduce BiasDetector, a framework that measures biases arising from three instruction types: complete, redundant, and insufficient. We evaluate several mainstream LLMs and find that, despite high headline accuracy, substantial biases persist in many downstream tasks as a direct consequence of prompt coverage. Our empirical study confirms that LLM reasoning reliability can still be significantly improved. We analyze the practical impact of these biases and outline mitigation strategies. Our findings underscore the need for developers to tackle biases and for users to craft options carefully.</p></details> |  |

Among RL-based post-training methods, group relative advantage estimation, as exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has attracted considerable attention for eliminating the dependency on the value model, thereby simplifying training compared to traditional approaches like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, we observe that exsiting group relative advantage estimation method still suffers from training inefficiencies, particularly when the estimated advantage approaches zero. To address this limitation, we propose Advantage-Augmented Policy Optimization (AAPO), a novel RL algorithm that optimizes the cross-entropy (CE) loss using advantages enhanced through a momentum-based estimation scheme. This approach effectively mitigates the inefficiencies associated with group relative advantage estimation. Experimental results on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of AAPO.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

We present Guided Reality, a fully automated AR system that generates embedded and dynamic visual guidance based on step-by-step instructions. Our system integrates LLMs and vision models to: 1) generate multi-step instructions from user queries, 2) identify appropriate types of visual guidance, 3) extract spatial information about key interaction points in the real world, and 4) embed visual guidance in physical space to support task execution. Drawing from a corpus of user manuals, we define five categories of visual guidance and propose an identification strategy based on the current step.

This paper presents an iterative meta-prompting methodology designed to optimise hard prompts without exposing proprietary or confidential context to the LLM. Through a novel regeneration process involving feeder and propagation methods, we demonstrate significant improvements in prompt efficacy. Evaluated on public datasets serving as proxies for financial tasks such as SQuAD for extractive financial Q&A, CNN/DailyMail for news summarisation, and SAMSum for client interaction summarisation, our approach, utilising GPT-3.5 Turbo, achieved a 103.87% improvement in ROUGE-L F1 for question answering.

| **[Beyond Sharp Minima: Robust LLM Unlearning via Feedback-Guided Multi-Point Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20230v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.</p></details> |  |

Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion decisions given resource constraints.

However, in order to benefit from the optimized execution of a database query language like SQL, generated outputs must align with the rules enforced by both type checkers and database contents. Current approaches address this challenge with orchestrations consisting of many LLM-based post-processing calls to ensure alignment between generated outputs and database values, introducing performance bottlenecks. We perform a study on the ability of various sized open-source language models to both parse and execute functions within a query language based on SQL, showing that small language models can excel as function executors over hybrid data sources. Then, we propose an efficient solution to enforce the well-typedness of LLM functions, demonstrating 7% accuracy improvement on a multi-hop question answering dataset with 53% improvement in latency over comparable solutions.

Most of this research takes a binary, essentialist view of gender: limiting its variation to the categories _men_ and _women_, conflating gender with sex, and ignoring different sexual identities. But gender and sexuality exist on a spectrum, so in this paper we study the biases of large language models (LLMs) towards sexual and gender minorities beyond binary categories. Grounding our study in a widely used social psychology model -- the Stereotype Content Model -- we demonstrate that English-language survey questions about social perceptions elicit more negative stereotypes of sexual and gender minorities from both humans and LLMs. We then extend this framework to a more realistic use case: text generation. Our analysis shows that LLMs generate stereotyped representations of sexual and gender minorities in this setting, showing that they amplify representational harms in creative writing, a widely advertised use for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables (including bibliography and appendix).

| **[STAF: Leveraging LLMs for Automated Attack Tree-Based Security Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20190v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern automotive development, security testing is critical for safeguarding systems against increasingly advanced threats. Attack trees are widely used to systematically represent potential attack vectors, but generating comprehensive test cases from these trees remains a labor-intensive, error-prone task that has seen limited automation in the context of testing vehicular systems. This paper introduces STAF (Security Test Automation Framework), a novel approach to automating security test case generation. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a four-step self-corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, STAF automates the generation of executable security test cases from attack trees, providing an end-to-end solution that encompasses the entire attack surface. We particularly show the elements and processes needed to provide an LLM to actually produce sensible and executable automotive security test suites, along with the integration with an automated testing framework. We further compare our tailored approach with general purpose (vanilla) LLMs and the performance of different LLMs (namely GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek) using our approach. We also demonstrate the method of our operation step-by-step in a concrete case study. Our results show significant improvements in efficiency, accuracy, scalability, and easy integration in any workflow, marking a substantial advancement in automating automotive security testing methodologies. Using TARAs as an input for verfication tests, we create synergies by connecting two vital elements of a secure automotive development process.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures, accepted for 23rd escar Europe (Nov 05-06, 2025, Frankfurt, Germany)</p></details> |
| **[Probing Gender Bias in Multilingual LLMs: A Case Study of Stereotypes in Persian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20168v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used worldwide, making it essential to ensure they are free from gender bias to prevent representational harm. While prior studies have examined such biases in high-resource languages, low-resource languages remain understudied. In this paper, we propose a template-based probing methodology, validated against real-world data, to uncover gender stereotypes in LLMs. As part of this framework, we introduce the Domain-Specific Gender Skew Index (DS-GSI), a metric that quantifies deviations from gender parity. We evaluate four prominent models, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen QwQ 32B, across four semantic domains, focusing on Persian, a low-resource language with distinct linguistic features. Our results show that all models exhibit gender stereotypes, with greater disparities in Persian than in English across all domains. Among these, sports reflect the most rigid gender biases. This study underscores the need for inclusive NLP practices and provides a framework for assessing bias in other low-resource languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and forthcoming at the Widening Natural Language Processing Workshop (WiNLP 2025) at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[CyberSOCEval: Benchmarking LLMs Capabilities for Malware Analysis and Threat Intelligence Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20166v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's cyber defenders are overwhelmed by a deluge of security alerts, threat intelligence signals, and shifting business context, creating an urgent need for AI systems to enhance operational security work. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to automate and scale Security Operations Center (SOC) operations, existing evaluations do not fully assess the scenarios most relevant to real-world defenders. This lack of informed evaluation impacts both AI developers and those applying LLMs to SOC automation. Without clear insight into LLM performance in real-world security scenarios, developers lack a north star for development, and users cannot reliably select the most effective models. Meanwhile, malicious actors are using AI to scale cyber attacks, highlighting the need for open source benchmarks to drive adoption and community-driven improvement among defenders and model developers. To address this, we introduce CyberSOCEval, a new suite of open source benchmarks within CyberSecEval 4. CyberSOCEval includes benchmarks tailored to evaluate LLMs in two tasks: Malware Analysis and Threat Intelligence Reasoning--core defensive domains with inadequate coverage in current benchmarks. Our evaluations show that larger, more modern LLMs tend to perform better, confirming the training scaling laws paradigm. We also find that reasoning models leveraging test time scaling do not achieve the same boost as in coding and math, suggesting these models have not been trained to reason about cybersecurity analysis, and pointing to a key opportunity for improvement. Finally, current LLMs are far from saturating our evaluations, showing that CyberSOCEval presents a significant challenge for AI developers to improve cyber defense capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEPS: Quantum-Inspired Reinforcement Learning for Coherent Reasoning Traces in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20105v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with maintaining coherent multi-step reasoning traces, particularly in tasks that require a structured logical flow. This work introduces a quantum-inspired approach to address the challenge by incorporating a fidelity-based reward derived from Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) into Proximal Policy Optimization. Unlike prior approaches that use direct supervision or contrastive objectives, the proposed method guides learning through structural consistency, offering a novel approach to enforce global coherence in generated reasoning traces. The proposed framework is evaluated using multiple coherence-determining metrics on diverse datasets such as GSM8K, StrategyQA, and EntailmentBank spanning arithmetic, intuitive, and entailment-based reasoning. Results show that the proposed quantum-inspired approach offers significant improvements over supervised, contrastive, and pretrained baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of quantum-inspired fidelity as a foundation to improve reasoning trace coherence in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Framework for LLM Evaluation with Answer Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20097v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable evaluation of large language models is essential to ensure their applicability in practical scenarios. Traditional benchmark-based evaluation methods often rely on fixed reference answers, limiting their ability to capture important qualitative aspects of generated responses. To address these shortcomings, we propose an integrated evaluation framework called \textit{self-refining descriptive evaluation with expert-driven diagnostics}, SPEED, which utilizes specialized functional experts to perform comprehensive, descriptive analyses of model outputs. Unlike conventional approaches, SPEED actively incorporates expert feedback across multiple dimensions, including hallucination detection, toxicity assessment, and lexical-contextual appropriateness. Experimental results demonstrate that SPEED achieves robust and consistent evaluation performance across diverse domains and datasets. Additionally, by employing relatively compact expert models, SPEED demonstrates superior resource efficiency compared to larger-scale evaluators. These findings illustrate that SPEED significantly enhances fairness and interpretability in LLM evaluations, offering a promising alternative to existing evaluation methodologies.</p></details> | 16pages |

We investigate this under uncertainty-based evaluation, testing whether pretraining exposure to causal examples improves causal understanding >18K PubMed sentences -- half from The Pile corpus, half post-2024 -- across seven models (Pythia-1.4B/7B/12B, GPT-J-6B, Dolly-7B/12B, Qwen-7B). We analyze model behavior through: (i) causal classification, where the model identifies causal relationships in text, and (ii) verbatim memorization probing, where we assess whether the model prefers previously seen causal statements over their paraphrases. Models perform four-way classification (direct/conditional/correlational/no-relationship) and select between originals and their generated paraphrases. Results show almost identical accuracy on seen/unseen sentences (p > 0.05), no memorization bias (24.8% original selection), and output distribution over the possible options is almost flat, with entropic values near the maximum (1.35/1.39), confirming random guessing. Instruction-tuned models show severe miscalibration (Qwen: > 95% confidence, 32.8% accuracy, ECE=0.49). Conditional relations induce highest entropy (+11% vs. direct). These findings suggest that failures in causal understanding arise from the lack of structured causal representation, rather than insufficient exposure to causal examples during pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in second UncertaiNLP workshop at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Why Do Some Inputs Break Low-Bit LLM Quantization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12044v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-bit weight-only quantization significantly reduces the memory footprint of large language models (LLMs), but disproportionately affects certain examples. We analyze diverse 3-4 bit methods on LLMs ranging from 7B-70B in size and find that the quantization errors of 50 pairs of methods are strongly correlated (avg. 0.82) on FineWeb examples. Moreover, the residual stream magnitudes of full-precision models are indicative of future quantization errors. We further establish a hypothesis that relates the residual stream magnitudes to error amplification and accumulation over layers. Using LLM localization techniques, early exiting, and activation patching, we show that examples with large errors rely on precise residual activations in the late layers, and that the outputs of MLP gates play a crucial role in maintaining the perplexity. Our work reveals why certain examples result in large quantization errors and which model components are most critical for performance preservation.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

Our approach decomposes demonstration generation into two steps: (1) offline demonstration annotation that extracts keyframes, salient objects, and pose-object relations; and (2) online keypose retargeting that adapts those keyframes to a new scene, given an initial observation. Using these modified keypoints, our system warps the original demonstration to generate a new trajectory, which is then executed, and the resulting demo, if successful, is saved. Because the annotation is reusable across scenes, we use Thompson sampling to optimize the annotation, significantly improving generation success rate. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, and find that our data annotation method consistently outperforms expert-engineered baselines. We further show an ensemble policy that combines the optimized LLM feed-forward plan with a learned feedback imitation learning controller. Finally, we demonstrate hardware feasibility on a Franka Emika Panda robot.

First, we investigate which of the former two-benchmarks or games-is most effective at discriminating LLMs of varying quality. Then, inspired by human cognitive assessments, we compile a suite of targeted tests that measure cognitive abilities deemed essential for effective language use, and we investigate their correlation with model performance in benchmarks and games. Our analyses reveal that interactive games are superior to standard benchmarks in discriminating models. Causal and logical reasoning correlate with both static and interactive tests, while differences emerge regarding core executive functions and social/emotional skills, which correlate more with games. We advocate for the development of new interactive benchmarks and targeted cognitive tasks inspired by assessing human abilities but designed specifically for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

However, confronted with complex prompts, LLMs frequently encounter difficulties in fulfilling all specified requirements within a single response. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and self-correction methodologies, we introduce Meeseeks (The name is inspired by Mr. Meeseeks from "Rick and Morty," a character renowned for efficiently accomplishing assigned tasks. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Meeseeks), a fully automated iterative instruction-following benchmark equipped with an integrated feedback mechanism. Meeseeks identifies erroneous components in model responses and provides corresponding feedback accurately, thereby iteratively guiding the model toward self-correction. The dataset contains over 700 curated instances annotated by 32 distinct capability tags in Chinese and English. Extensive experimental results reveal that different state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs exhibit vastly disparate performance, and even after 20 turns of iterative feedback-driven self-correction, nearly all models demonstrate suboptimal performance. We conducted comprehensive analysis from both macro and instance levels, uncovering numerous common issues prevalent in current state-of-the-art models, as well as several counterintuitive phenomena. We've open-sourced our work on https://github.com/ADoublLEN/Meeseeks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied AI: From LLMs to World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20021v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models (WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building internal representations and future predictions of the external world, facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances, covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e., embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs, meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE CASM</p></details> |

These agentic LLM inference tasks are fundamentally different from chatbot-focused inference -- they often have much larger context lengths to capture complex, prolonged inputs, such as entire webpage DOMs or complicated tool call trajectories. This, in turn, generates significant off-chip memory traffic for the underlying hardware at the inference stage and causes the workload to be constrained by two memory walls, namely the bandwidth and capacity memory walls, preventing the on-chip compute units from achieving high utilization. In this paper, we introduce PLENA, a hardware-software co-designed system that applies three core optimization pathways to tackle these challenges. PLENA includes an efficient hardware implementation of compute and memory units supporting an asymmetric quantization scheme. PLENA also features a novel flattened systolic array architecture that has native support for FlashAttention to tackle these memory walls in the scenario of inference serving for long-context LLMs. Additionally, PLENA is developed with a complete stack, including a custom ISA, a compiler, a cycle-emulated simulator, and an automated design space exploration flow. The simulated results show that PLENA achieves up to 8.5x higher utilization than existing accelerators, and delivers 2.24x higher throughput than the A100 GPU and 3.85x higher throughput than the TPU v6e, under the same multiplier count and memory settings. The full PLENA system will also be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Knowledge-Behaviour Disconnect in LLM-based Chatbots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20004v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model-based artificial conversational agents (like ChatGPT) give answers to all kinds of questions, and often enough these answers are correct. Just on the basis of that capacity alone, we may attribute knowledge to them. But do these models use this knowledge as a basis for their own conversational behaviour? I argue this is not the case, and I will refer to this failure as a `disconnect'. I further argue this disconnect is fundamental in the sense that with more data and more training of the LLM on which a conversational chatbot is based, it will not disappear. The reason is, as I will claim, that the core technique used to train LLMs does not allow for the establishment of the connection we are after. The disconnect reflects a fundamental limitation on the capacities of LLMs, and explains the source of hallucinations. I will furthermore consider the ethical version of the disconnect (ethical conversational knowledge not being aligned with ethical conversational behaviour), since in this domain researchers have come up with several additional techniques to influence a chatbot's behaviour. I will discuss how these techniques do nothing to solve the disconnect and can make it worse.</p></details> |  |

The success of deep learning models, and LLMs in particular, has been alternatively taken as showing that the distributed camp has won, or dismissed as an irrelevant engineering development. In this position paper, I argue that deep learning models for language actually represent a synthesis between the two traditions. This is because 1) deep learning architectures allow for both distributed/continuous/fuzzy and symbolic/discrete/categorical-like representations and processing; 2) models trained on language make use of this flexibility. In particular, I review recent research in interpretability that showcases how a substantial part of morphosyntactic knowledge is encoded in a near-discrete fashion in LLMs. This line of research suggests that different behaviors arise in an emergent fashion, and models flexibly alternate between the two modes (and everything in between) as needed. This is possibly one of the main reasons for their wild success; and it makes them particularly interesting for the study of language.

In this work, we propose CON-QA, a hybrid privacy-preserving framework designed specifically for secure question answering over enterprise contracts, effectively combining local and cloud-hosted LLMs. The CON-QA framework operates through three stages: (i) semantic query decomposition and query-aware document chunk retrieval using a locally deployed LLM analysis, (ii) anonymization of detected sensitive entities via a structured one-to-many mapping scheme, ensuring semantic coherence while preventing cross-session entity inference attacks, and (iii) anonymized response generation by a cloud-based LLM, with accurate reconstruction of the original answer locally using a session-consistent many-to-one reverse mapping. To rigorously evaluate CON-QA, we introduce CUAD-QA, a corpus of 85k question-answer pairs generated over 510 real-world CUAD contract documents, encompassing simple, complex, and summarization-style queries. Empirical evaluations, complemented by detailed human assessments, confirm that CON-QA effectively maintains both privacy and utility, preserves answer quality, maintains fidelity to legal clause semantics, and significantly mitigates privacy risks, demonstrating its practical suitability for secure, enterprise-level contract documents.</p></details> |  |

Current LLMs often generate answers without reliable source attribution, or worse, with incorrect attributions, posing a barrier to their use in scientific and high-stakes settings, where traceability and accountability are paramount. To be reliable, attribution systems require high accuracy for short-length attribution on retrieved data, i.e., attribution to a sentence within a document rather than the entire document. We propose SAFE, a Sentence-level A ttribution FramEwork for Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that attributes generated sentences during generation. This allows users to verify sentences as they read them and correct the model when the attribution indicates the generated text is not grounded in the documents, increasing the safety of LLM systems. This framework consists of two steps: predicting the required number of references for a sentence, and attributing the sentence. Our approach achieved 95% accuracy in the first step, which translated to 2.1\~6.0% improvements in the accuracy (normalized for maximum possible accuracy) of all attribution algorithms in our clean dataset, when compared to their top-1 accuracy. We also applied SAFE in real-world scenarios with documents containing hundreds to thousands of sentences. In these settings, SAFE reliably attributed sentences to their source documents, demonstrating that the method generalizes beyond controlled benchmarks. The SAFE framework and the training dataset are publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages (9 pages of content, 5 pages of references, 16 pages of supplementary material), 7 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters. Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation. We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers, senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses them for future reasoning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam, SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Augmentation of GNNs for ILPs: Local Uniqueness Suffices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21000v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme, we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired with a state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 Tables |

To address these issues, we propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance. Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12 real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery, charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions. Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide': internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically, the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques. Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Medical Image Analysis.

Existing pipelines capture only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability. Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations, and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context. Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines, which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable, reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEDAN: Learning the Edit Costs for Graph Edit Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03111v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). However, most NN methods assume a unit cost for edit operations -- a restrictive and often unrealistic simplification, since topological and functional distances rarely coincide in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a fully end-to-end Graph Neural Network framework for learning the edit costs for GED, at a fine-grained level, aligning topological and task-specific similarity. Our method combines an unsupervised self-organizing mechanism for GED approximation with a Generalized Additive Model that flexibly learns contextualized edit costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach overcomes the limitations of non-end-to-end methods, yielding directly interpretable graph matchings, uncovering meaningful structures in complex graphs, and showing strong applicability to domains such as molecular analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mesh Interpolation Graph Network for Dynamic and Spatially Irregular Global Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20911v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have shown promising results in weather forecasting, which is critical for human activity such as agriculture planning and extreme weather preparation. However, most studies focus on finite and local areas for training, overlooking the influence of broader areas and limiting their ability to generalize effectively. Thus, in this work, we study global weather forecasting that is irregularly distributed and dynamically varying in practice, requiring the model to generalize to unobserved locations. To address such challenges, we propose a general Mesh Interpolation Graph Network (MIGN) that models the irregular weather station forecasting, consisting of two key designs: (1) learning spatially irregular data with regular mesh interpolation network to align the data; (2) leveraging parametric spherical harmonics location embedding to further enhance spatial generalization ability. Extensive experiments on an up-to-date observation dataset show that MIGN significantly outperforms existing data-driven models. Besides, we show that MIGN has spatial generalization ability, and is capable of generalizing to previous unseen stations.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 main track</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Molecular Property Prediction with Knowledge from Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20664v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations, particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a robust and effective solution for MPP.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Regardless of their successes, current methods frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID) benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts. Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without specialized DG algorithms (on four out of six benchmarks). Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets, specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Highlighting its model-agnostic design, the method yielded valuable insights into both GT and MPNN backbones and appears well suited for broader DG applications beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Variate Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20311v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Simple Graphs: Neural Multi-Objective Routing on Multigraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22095v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. Yet, existing methods are unsuitable for routing on multigraphs, which feature multiple edges with distinct attributes between node pairs, despite their strong relevance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose two graph neural network-based methods to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach operates directly on the multigraph by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. The second model, which is more scalable, first simplifies the multigraph via a learned pruning strategy and then performs autoregressive routing on the resulting simple graph. We evaluate both models empirically, across a wide range of problems and graph distributions, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to strong heuristics and neural baselines.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 Figures |
| **[Heterogeneous Directed Hypergraph Neural Network over abstract syntax tree (AST) for Code Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04228v6)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code classification is a difficult issue in program understanding and automatic coding. Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural network (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 35th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2023) as a regular paper; the latest version is consistent with the official conference version</p></details> |

Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging learning framework to collaboratively train graph data from various clients. Although FGL allows client data to remain localized, a malicious server can still steal client private data information through uploaded gradient. In this paper, we for the first time propose label distribution attacks (LDAs) on FGL that aim to infer the label distributions of the client-side data. Firstly, we observe that the effectiveness of LDA is closely related to the variance of node embeddings in GNNs. Next, we analyze the relation between them and propose a new attack named EC-LDA, which significantly improves the attack effectiveness by compressing node embeddings. Then, extensive experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks across six widely used graph datasets show that EC-LDA outperforms the SOTA LDAs. Specifically, EC-LDA can achieve the Cos-sim as high as 1.0 under almost all cases. Finally, we explore the robustness of EC-LDA under differential privacy protection and discuss the potential effective defense methods to EC-LDA. Our code is available at https://github.com/cheng-t/EC-LDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by 2025 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2025)</p></details> |

The proposed ICP algorithm decomposes a TSP-D solution into smaller segments called chainlets, each optimized individually by a dynamic programming subroutine. The chainlet with the highest improvement is updated, and the procedure is repeated until no further improvement is possible. We show that the subroutine runs in quadratic time and the number of subroutine calls is bounded linearly in problem size for the first iteration and remains constant in subsequent iterations, ensuring algorithmic scalability. Empirical results show that ICP outperforms existing algorithms in both solution quality and computational time. Tested over 1,249 benchmark instances, ICP yields an average improvement of 2.6\% in solution quality over the previous state-of-the-art algorithm while reducing computational time by 91.3\%. The procedure is deterministic, ensuring reliability without requiring multiple runs. The subroutine is the computational bottleneck in the already efficient ICP algorithm. To reduce the necessity of subroutine calls, we integrate a graph neural network (GNN) to predict incremental improvements. We demonstrate that the resulting Neuro ICP (NICP) achieves substantial acceleration while maintaining solution quality. Compared to ICP, NICP reduces the total computational time by 28.6\%, while the objective function value increase is limited to 0.14\%. A transfer learning framework enables efficient extension to various operational constraints, making this a valuable foundation for developing efficient algorithms for truck-drone synchronized routing problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: M...</summary><p>v2: Major revision.

We introduce the first implementation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth method specifically tailored for data-driven AR prediction, leveraging historical derivative information to enhance numerical stability without additional computational overhead. To validate our approach, we systematically evaluate time integration schemes across canonical 2D PDEs before extending to complex Navier-Stokes cylinder vortex shedding dynamics. Additionally, we develop three novel adaptive weighting strategies that dynamically adjust the importance of different future time steps during multi-step rollout training. Our analysis reveals that as physical complexity increases, such sophisticated rollout techniques become essential, with the Adams-Bashforth scheme demonstrating consistent robustness across investigated systems and our best adaptive approach delivering an 89% improvement over conventional fixed-weight methods while maintaining similar computational costs. For the complex Navier-Stokes vortex shedding problem, despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps reducing mean squared error from 0.125 (single-step direct prediction) to 0.002 (Adams-Bashforth with proposed multi-step rollout). Our integrated methodology demonstrates an 83% improvement over standard noise injection techniques and maintains robustness under severe spatial constraints; specifically, when trained on only a partial spatial domain, it still achieves 58% and 27% improvements over direct prediction and forward Euler methods, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Text Semantics and Graph Structures for Temporal Text-attributed Graphs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14411v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have shown remarkable performance in temporal graph modeling. However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich textual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs). Such combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures introduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and rely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural information, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the essential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic reinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \textbf{CROSS}, a flexible framework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. CROSS is designed by decomposing the TTAG modeling process into two phases: (i) temporal semantics extraction; and (ii) semantic-structural information unification. The key idea is to advance the large language models (LLMs) to dynamically extract the temporal semantics in text space and then generate cohesive representations unifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Semantics Extractor in the CROSS framework, which empowers LLMs to offer the temporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual neighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the Semantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for synthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic and structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that CROSS achieves state-of-the-art results on four public datasets and one industrial dataset, with 24.7% absolute MRR gain on average in temporal link prediction and 3.7% AUC gain in node classification of industrial application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Agents cache the most recent samples from others and communicate over wireless collision channels governed by an underlying graph topology. Our goal is to minimize time-average estimation error and/or age of information with decentralized scalable sampling and transmission policies, considering both oblivious (where decision-making is independent of the physical processes) and non-oblivious policies (where decision-making depends on physical processes). We prove that in oblivious policies, minimizing estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the age of information. The complexity of the problem, especially the multi-dimensional action spaces and arbitrary network topologies, makes theoretical methods for finding optimal transmission policies intractable. We optimize the policies using a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, where each agent employs a permutation-equivariant graph neural network architecture. Theoretically, we prove that our proposed framework exhibits desirable transferability properties, allowing transmission policies trained on small- or moderate-size networks to be executed effectively on large-scale topologies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) The trained policies are transferable to larger networks, and their performance gains increase with the number of agents; (iii) The training procedure withstands non-stationarity even if we utilize independent learning techniques; and, (iv) Recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity in independent learning.</p></details> |  |

While radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI, many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10% improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review: npj Digital Medicine</p></details> |

In this work, we formalize the problem as a collection of interdependent subtasks, and propose a unified graph neural network (GNN) framework that targets the case of piano music and quantized symbolic input. Our method employs a multi-task GNN to jointly predict voice connections, staff assignments, pitch spelling, key signature, stem direction, octave shifts, and clef signs. A dedicated postprocessing pipeline generates print-ready MusicXML/MEI outputs. Comprehensive evaluation on two diverse piano corpora (J-Pop and DCML Romantic) demonstrates that our unified model achieves good accuracy across all subtasks, compared to existing systems that only specialize in specific subtasks.

However, they face some fundamental limitations: feature oversmoothing can cause node representations to become indistinguishable in deeper networks, they struggle to effectively manage heterogeneous relationships where connected nodes differ significantly, and they process entire feature vectors as indivisible units, which limits flexibility. We seek to address these limitations. We propose AxelGNN, a novel GNN architecture inspired by Axelrod's cultural dissemination model that addresses these limitations through a unified framework. AxelGNN incorporates similarity-gated probabilistic interactions that adaptively promote convergence or divergence based on node similarity, implements trait-level copying mechanisms for fine-grained feature aggregation at the segment level, and maintains global polarization to preserve node distinctiveness across multiple representation clusters. The model's bistable convergence dynamics naturally handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs within a single architecture. Extensive experiments on node classification and influence estimation benchmarks demonstrate that AxelGNN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNN methods across diverse graph structures with varying homophily-heterophily characteristics.</p></details> |  |

Traditional physics-based models face scalability challenges and are computationally demanding, while data-driven approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often lack physical consistency, interpretability, and generalization. In this paper, we propose Dynami-CAL GraphNet, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network that integrates the learning capabilities of GNNs with physics-based inductive biases to address these limitations. Dynami-CAL GraphNet enforces pairwise conservation of linear and angular momentum for interacting nodes using edge-local reference frames that are equivariant to rotational symmetries, invariant to translations, and equivariant to node permutations. This design ensures physically consistent predictions of node dynamics while offering interpretable, edge-wise linear and angular impulses resulting from pairwise interactions. Evaluated on a 3D granular system with inelastic collisions, Dynami-CAL GraphNet demonstrates stable error accumulation over extended rollouts, effective extrapolations to unseen configurations, and robust handling of heterogeneous interactions and external forces. Dynami-CAL GraphNet offers significant advantages in fields requiring accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of complex multi-body dynamical systems, such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and materials science. By providing physically consistent and scalable predictions that adhere to fundamental conservation laws, it enables the inference of forces and moments while efficiently handling heterogeneous interactions and external forces.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViG-LRGC: Vision Graph Neural Networks with Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18840v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision. Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers. Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark dataset.</p></details> | Under Review |

| **[Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06743v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning. Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral-domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: New Perspectives in Advancing Graph Machine Learning</p></details> |

Existing methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), mostly focus on static TAGs. Extending these existing methods to DyTAGs is challenging as they largely neglect the recent-global temporal semantics: the recent semantic dependencies among interaction texts and the global semantic evolution of nodes over time. Furthermore, applying LLMs to the abundant and evolving text in DyTAGs faces efficiency issues. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic Global-Recent Adaptive Semantic Processing (DyGRASP), a novel method that leverages LLMs and temporal GNNs to efficiently and effectively reason on DyTAGs. Specifically, we first design a node-centric implicit reasoning method together with a sliding window mechanism to efficiently capture recent temporal semantics. In addition, to capture global semantic dynamics of nodes, we leverage explicit reasoning with tailored prompts and an RNN-like chain structure to infer long-term semantics. Lastly, we intricately integrate the recent and global temporal semantics as well as the dynamic graph structural information using updating and merging layers. Extensive experiments on DyTAG benchmarks demonstrate DyGRASP's superiority, achieving up to 34% improvement in Hit@10 for destination node retrieval task. Besides, DyGRASP exhibits strong generalization across different temporal GNNs and LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABG-NAS: Adaptive Bayesian Genetic Neural Architecture Search for Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21254v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective and efficient graph representation learning is essential for enabling critical downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and subgraph search. However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to produce structure-aware and task-discriminative representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures.

| **[GALLa: Graph Aligned Large Language Models for Improved Source Code Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04183v4)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming languages possess rich semantic information - such as data flow - that is represented by graphs and not available from the surface form of source code. Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with seven different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 14B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5-Coder.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270v6)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction builds on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes -- namely, the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET -- which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar--Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). Both the $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs adopt a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN), cascading the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation -- akin to local pooling in CNNs -- that can be performed either locally or per scale. Such pooling operations are more difficult to define in traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets and in geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, our approach extracts a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be combined with simple machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification with far fewer trainable parameters than most modern graph neural networks require. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MHSNs on three distinct problem types: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, Comments Welcome</p></details> |

Its clinical and biological heterogeneity makes diagnosis and subtype differentiation highly challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown strong potential in modeling brain connectivity, but their limited robustness, data scarcity, and lack of interpretability constrain clinical adoption. Explainable Graph Neural Networks (XGNNs) have emerged to address these barriers by combining graph-based learning with interpretability, enabling the identification of disease-relevant biomarkers, analysis of brain network disruptions, and provision of transparent insights for clinicians. This paper presents the first comprehensive review dedicated to XGNNs in dementia research. We examine their applications across Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and multi-disease diagnosis. A taxonomy of explainability methods tailored for dementia-related tasks is introduced, alongside comparisons of existing models in clinical scenarios. We also highlight challenges such as limited generalizability, underexplored domains, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) for early detection. By outlining both progress and open problems, this review aims to guide future work toward trustworthy, clinically meaningful, and scalable use of XGNNs in dementia research.</p></details> |  |

Automated Anti-money laundering (AML) models, like Graph Neural Networks (GNN), can be trained to identify illicit transactions in real time. A major issue for developing such models is the lack of access to training data due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. Synthetically generated data that mimics the statistical properties of real data but preserves privacy and confidentiality has been proposed as a solution. However, training AML models on purely synthetic datasets presents its own set of challenges. This article proposes the use of hybrid datasets to augment the utility of synthetic datasets by incorporating publicly available, easily accessible, and real-world features. These additions demonstrate that hybrid datasets not only preserve privacy but also improve model utility, offering a practical pathway for financial institutions to enhance AML systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) Research Institute Annual Meeting, Las Vegas, NV, (2024)</p></details> |
| **[Estimating Heterogeneous Causal Effect on Networks via Orthogonal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18484v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating causal effects on networks is important for both scientific research and practical applications. Unlike traditional settings that assume the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), interference allows an intervention/treatment on one unit to affect the outcomes of others. Understanding both direct and spillover effects is critical in fields such as epidemiology, political science, and economics. Causal inference on networks faces two main challenges. First, causal effects are typically heterogeneous, varying with unit features and local network structure. Second, connected units often exhibit dependence due to network homophily, creating confounding between structural correlations and causal effects. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method to estimate heterogeneous direct and spillover effects on networks. The first stage uses graph neural networks to estimate nuisance components that depend on the complex network topology. In the second stage, we adjust for network confounding using these estimates and infer causal effects through a novel attention-based interference model. Our approach balances expressiveness and interpretability, enabling downstream tasks such as identifying influential neighborhoods and recovering the sign of spillover effects. We integrate the two stages using Neyman orthogonalization and cross-fitting, which ensures that errors from nuisance estimation contribute only at higher order. As a result, our causal effect estimates are robust to bias and misspecification in modeling causal effects under network dependencies.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogate models for mesh-based data, their standard autoregressive application for long-term prediction is often plagued by error accumulation and instability. To address this, we introduce MeshODENet, a general framework that synergizes the spatial reasoning of GNNs with the continuous-time modeling of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and versatility on a series of challenging structural mechanics problems, including one- and two-dimensional elastic bodies undergoing large, non-linear deformations. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models in long-term predictive accuracy and stability, while achieving substantial computational speed-ups over traditional solvers. This work presents a powerful and generalizable approach for developing data-driven surrogates to accelerate the analysis and modeling of complex structural systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

While local explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation methods, those that characterize an entire class, remain underdeveloped. Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space, exemplars, and explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem over reverse k-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study with 60 participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 20 figures, NeurIPS 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[A Graph-Neural-Network-Entropy model of vital node identification on network attack and propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18325v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vital nodes usually play a key role in complex networks. Uncovering these nodes is an important task in protecting the network, especially when the network suffers intentional attack. Many existing methods have not fully integrated the node feature, interaction and state. In this article, we propose a novel method (GNNE) based on graph neural networks and information entropy. The method employs a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn the nodes' features, which are input into a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to obtain the influence factor of nodes, and the node influence factors are used to calculate the nodes' entropy to evaluate the node importance. The GNNE takes advantage of the GCN and GAT, with the GCN well extracting the nodes' features and the GAT aggregating the features of the nodes' neighbors by using the attention mechanism to assign different weights to the neighbors with different importance, and the nodes' entropy quantifies the nodes' state in the network. The proposed method is trained on a synthetic Barabasi-Albert network, and tested on six real datasets. Compared with eight traditional topology-based methods and four graph-machine-learning-based methods, the GNNE shows an advantage for the vital node identification in the perspectives of network attack and propagation.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines anatomically-informed graph structures with contrastive learning to address key challenges in handshape recognition, including subtle interclass distinctions and temporal variations. We establish the first benchmark for structured handshape recognition in signing sequences, achieving 46% accuracy across 37 handshape classes (with baseline methods achieving 25%).</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce BETA, a novel grey-box evasion attack targeting such GNN-based detectors, where the attacker is constrained to perturb sensor readings from a limited set of nodes, excluding the target sensor, with the goal of either suppressing a true anomaly or triggering a false alarm at the target node. BETA identifies the sensors most influential to the target node's classification and injects carefully crafted adversarial perturbations into their features, all while maintaining stealth and respecting the attacker's budget. Experiments on three real-world sensor network datasets show that BETA reduces the detection accuracy of state-of-the-art GNN-based detectors by 30.62 to 39.16% on average, and significantly outperforms baseline attack strategies, while operating within realistic constraints.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Interpreting Graph Inference with Skyline Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07635v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference queries have been routinely issued to graph machine learning models such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for various network analytical tasks. Nevertheless, GNN outputs are often hard to interpret comprehensively. Existing methods typically conform to individual pre-defined explainability measures (such as fidelity), which often leads to biased, ``one-side'' interpretations. This paper introduces skyline explanation, a new paradigm that interprets GNN outputs by simultaneously optimizing multiple explainability measures of users' interests. (1) We propose skyline explanations as a Pareto set of explanatory subgraphs that dominate others over multiple explanatory measures. We formulate skyline explanation as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and establish its hardness results. (2) We design efficient algorithms with an onion-peeling approach, which strategically prioritizes nodes and removes unpromising edges to incrementally assemble skyline explanations. (3) We also develop an algorithm to diversify the skyline explanations to enrich the comprehensive interpretation. (4) We introduce efficient parallel algorithms with load-balancing strategies to scale skyline explanation for large-scale GNN-based inference. Using real-world and synthetic graphs, we experimentally verify our algorithms' effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpreting GNN-based IDS Detections Using Provenance Graph Structural Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00934v6)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced cyber threats (e.g., Fileless Malware and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)) have driven the adoption of provenance-based security solutions. These solutions employ Machine Learning (ML) models for behavioral modeling and critical security tasks such as malware and anomaly detection. However, the opacity of ML-based security models limits their broader adoption, as the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes restricts explainability and verifiability. We tailored our solution towards Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based security solutions since recent studies employ GNNs to comprehensively digest system provenance graphs for security-critical tasks. To enhance the explainability of GNN-based security models, we introduce PROVEXPLAINER, a framework offering instance-level security-aware explanations using an interpretable surrogate model. PROVEXPLAINER's interpretable feature space consists of discriminant subgraph patterns and graph structural features, which can be directly mapped to the system provenance problem space, making the explanations human interpretable. We show how PROVEXPLAINER synergizes with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN explainers to deliver domain and instance-specific explanations. We measure the explanation quality using the Fidelity+/Fidelity- metric as used by traditional GNN explanation literature, we incorporate the precision/recall metric, where we consider the accuracy of the explanation against the ground truth, and we designed a human actionability metric based on graph traversal distance. On real-world Fileless and APT datasets, PROVEXPLAINER achieves up to 29%/27%/25%/1.4x higher Fidelity+, precision, recall, and actionability (where higher values are better), and 12% lower Fidelity- (where lower values are better) when compared against SOTA GNN explainers.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScaleGNN: Towards Scalable Graph Neural Networks via Adaptive High-order Neighboring Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15920v5)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance across diverse graph-based tasks by leveraging message passing to capture complex node relationships. However, when applied to large-scale real-world graphs, GNNs face two major challenges: First, it becomes increasingly difficult to ensure both scalability and efficiency, as the repeated aggregation of large neighborhoods leads to significant computational overhead; Second, the over-smoothing problem arises, where excessive or deep propagation makes node representations indistinguishable, severely hindering model expressiveness. To tackle these issues, we propose ScaleGNN, a novel framework that adaptively fuses multi-hop node features for both scalable and effective graph learning. First, we construct per-hop pure neighbor matrices that capture only the exclusive structural information at each hop, avoiding the redundancy of conventional aggregation. Then, an enhanced feature fusion strategy significantly balances low-order and high-order information, preserving both local detail and global correlations without incurring excessive complexity. To further reduce redundancy and over-smoothing, we introduce a Local Contribution Score (LCS)-based masking mechanism to filter out less relevant high-order neighbors, ensuring that only the most meaningful information is aggregated. In addition, learnable sparse constraints selectively integrate multi-hop valuable features, emphasizing the most informative high-order neighbors. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ScaleGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, highlighting its practical value for large-scale graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[FastNet: Improving the physical consistency of machine-learning weather prediction models through loss function design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17601v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) models have demonstrated remarkable potential in delivering accurate forecasts at significantly reduced computational cost compared to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. However, challenges remain in ensuring the physical consistency of MLWP outputs, particularly in deterministic settings. This study presents FastNet, a graph neural network (GNN)-based global prediction model, and investigates the impact of alternative loss function designs on improving the physical realism of its forecasts. We explore three key modifications to the standard mean squared error (MSE) loss: (1) a modified spherical harmonic (MSH) loss that penalises spectral amplitude errors to reduce blurring and enhance small-scale structure retention; (2) inclusion of horizontal gradient terms in the loss to suppress non-physical artefacts; and (3) an alternative wind representation that decouples speed and direction to better capture extreme wind events. Results show that while the MSH and gradient-based losses \textit{alone} may slightly degrade RMSE scores, when trained in combination the model exhibits very similar MSE performance to an MSE-trained model while at the same time significantly improving spectral fidelity and physical consistency. The alternative wind representation further improves wind speed accuracy and reduces directional bias. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of loss function design as a mechanism for embedding domain knowledge into MLWP models and advancing their operational readiness.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MTS anomaly detection methods are mostly defined on the static graph structure, which fails to perform an accurate representation of complex spatio-temporal correlations in MTS. To address this issue, this study proposes a Periodic Graph-Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detector (PGMA) with the following two-fold ideas: a) designing a periodic time-slot allocation strategy based Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which enables the graph structure to reflect dynamic changes in MTS; b) utilizing graph neural network and temporal extension convolution to accurate extract the complex spatio-temporal correlations from the reconstructed periodic graphs. Experiments on four real datasets from real applications demonstrate that the proposed PGMA outperforms state-of-the-art models in MTS anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preserving Node-level Privacy in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06888v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential privacy (DP) has seen immense applications in learning on tabular, image, and sequential data where instance-level privacy is concerned. In learning on graphs, contrastingly, works on node-level privacy are highly sparse. Challenges arise as existing DP protocols hardly apply to the message-passing mechanism in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this study, we propose a solution that specifically addresses the issue of node-level privacy. Our protocol consists of two main components: 1) a sampling routine called HeterPoisson, which employs a specialized node sampling strategy and a series of tailored operations to generate a batch of sub-graphs with desired properties, and 2) a randomization routine that utilizes symmetric multivariate Laplace (SML) noise instead of the commonly used Gaussian noise. Our privacy accounting shows this particular combination provides a non-trivial privacy guarantee. In addition, our protocol enables GNN learning with good performance, as demonstrated by experiments on five real-world datasets; compared with existing baselines, our method shows significant advantages, especially in the high privacy regime. Experimentally, we also 1) perform membership inference attacks against our protocol and 2) apply privacy audit techniques to confirm our protocol's privacy integrity. In the sequel, we present a study on a seemingly appealing approach \cite{sajadmanesh2023gap} (USENIX'23) that protects node-level privacy via differentially private node/instance embeddings. Unfortunately, such work has fundamental privacy flaws, which are identified through a thorough case study. More importantly, we prove an impossibility result of achieving both (strong) privacy and (acceptable) utility through private instance embedding. The implication is that such an approach has intrinsic utility barriers when enforcing differential privacy.</p></details> |  |

However, most efforts have suggested that native interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process, motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to improve representation learning in heterophilous and homophilous graphs. Specifically, we define the torque by treating the feature distance as a lever arm vector and the neighbor feature as a force vector weighted by the homophily disparity between nodes. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing the impact of irrelevant information and boosting pertinent signals during message passing. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art rewiring methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in multivariate time series anomaly detection (TSAD) have increasingly leveraged graph structures to model inter-variable relationships, typically employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Despite their promising results, existing methods often rely on a single graph representation, which are insufficient for capturing the complex, diverse relationships inherent in multivariate time series. To address this, we propose the Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion (PMGC) framework for multivariate TSAD. PMGC exploits spatial correlations by integrating a long-term static graph with a series of short-term instance-wise dynamic graphs, regulated through a graph cohesion loss function. Our theoretical analysis shows that this loss function promotes diversity among dynamic graphs while aligning them with the stable long-term relationships encapsulated by the static graph. Additionally, we introduce a "prospective graphing" strategy to mitigate the limitations of traditional forecasting-based TSAD methods, which often struggle with unpredictable future variations.

| **[A Scalable Multi-Robot Framework for Decentralized and Asynchronous Perception-Action-Communication Loops](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10164v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaboration in large robot swarms to achieve a common global objective is a challenging problem in large environments due to limited sensing and communication capabilities. The robots must execute a Perception-Action-Communication (PAC) loop -- they perceive their local environment, communicate with other robots, and take actions in real time. A fundamental challenge in decentralized PAC systems is to decide what information to communicate with the neighboring robots and how to take actions while utilizing the information shared by the neighbors. Recently, this has been addressed using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for applications such as flocking and coverage control. Although conceptually, GNN policies are fully decentralized, the evaluation and deployment of such policies have primarily remained centralized or restrictively decentralized. Furthermore, existing frameworks assume sequential execution of perception and action inference, which is very restrictive in real-world applications. This paper proposes a framework for asynchronous PAC in robot swarms, where decentralized GNNs are used to compute navigation actions and generate messages for communication. In particular, we use aggregated GNNs, which enable the exchange of hidden layer information between robots for computational efficiency and decentralized inference of actions. Furthermore, the modules in the framework are asynchronous, allowing robots to perform sensing, extracting information, communication, action inference, and control execution at different frequencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNs executed in the proposed framework in navigating large robot swarms for collaborative coverage of large environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expressive Power of Graph Neural Networks for (Mixed-Integer) Quadratic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05938v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadratic programming (QP) is the most widely applied category of problems in nonlinear programming. Many applications require real-time/fast solutions, though not necessarily with high precision. Existing methods either involve matrix decomposition or use the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. For relatively large instances, these methods cannot achieve the real-time requirement unless there is an effective preconditioner. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) opened new possibilities for QP. Some promising empirical studies of applying GNNs for QP tasks show that GNNs can capture key characteristics of an optimization instance and provide adaptive guidance accordingly to crucial configurations during the solving process, or directly provide an approximate solution. However, the theoretical understanding of GNNs in this context remains limited. Specifically, it is unclear what GNNs can and cannot achieve for QP tasks in theory. This work addresses this gap in the context of linearly constrained QP tasks. In the continuous setting, we prove that message-passing GNNs can universally represent fundamental properties of convex quadratic programs, including feasibility, optimal objective values, and optimal solutions. In the more challenging mixed-integer setting, while GNNs are not universal approximators, we identify a subclass of QP problems that GNNs can reliably represent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Discovery of Neural Circuits in Spatially Patterned Neural Responses with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17174v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring synaptic connectivity from neural population activity is a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience, complicated by partial observability and mismatches between inference models and true circuit dynamics. In this study, we propose a graph-based neural inference model that simultaneously predicts neural activity and infers latent connectivity by modeling neurons as interacting nodes in a graph. The architecture features two distinct modules: one for learning structural connectivity and another for predicting future spiking activity via a graph neural network (GNN). Our model accommodates unobserved neurons through auxiliary nodes, allowing for inference in partially observed circuits. We evaluate this approach using synthetic data from ring attractor networks and real spike recordings from head direction cells in mice. Across a wide range of conditions, including varying recurrent connectivity, external inputs, and incomplete observations, our model consistently outperforms standard baselines, resolving spurious correlations more effectively and recovering accurate weight profiles. When applied to real data, the inferred connectivity aligns with theoretical predictions of continuous attractor models. These results highlight the potential of GNN-based models to infer latent neural circuitry through self-supervised structure learning, while leveraging the spike prediction task to flexibly link connectivity and dynamics across both simulated and biological neural systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The two networks interact with each other at the layer level to find a saddle point of the Lagrangian. The primal GNN finds a stationary point for a given dual multiplier, while the dual network iteratively refines its estimates to reach an optimal solution. We force the primal and dual networks to mirror the dynamics of the DA algorithm by imposing descent and ascent constraints. We propose a joint training scheme that alternates between updating the primal and dual networks. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach yields near-optimal near-feasible solutions and generalizes well to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepEOSNet: Capturing the dependency on thermodynamic state in property prediction tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17018v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a machine learning (ML) architecture to better capture the dependency of thermodynamic properties on the independent states. When predicting state-dependent thermodynamic properties, ML models need to account for both molecular structure and the thermodynamic state, described by independent variables, typically temperature, pressure, and composition. Modern molecular ML models typically include state information by adding it to molecular fingerprint vectors or by embedding explicit (semi-empirical) thermodynamic relations. Here, we propose to rather split the information processing on the molecular structure and the dependency on states into two separate network channels: a graph neural network and a multilayer perceptron, whose output is combined by a dot product. We refer to our approach as DeepEOSNet, as this idea is based on the DeepONet architecture [Lu et al. (2021), Nat. Mach. Intell.]: instead of operators, we learn state dependencies, with the possibility to predict equation of states (EOS). We investigate the predictive performance of DeepEOSNet by means of three case studies, which include the prediction of vapor pressure as a function of temperature, and mixture molar volume as a function of composition, temperature, and pressure. Our results show superior performance of DeepEOSNet for predicting vapor pressure and comparable performance for predicting mixture molar volume compared to state-of-research graph-based thermodynamic prediction models from our earlier works. In fact, we see large potential of DeepEOSNet in cases where data is sparse in the state domain and the output function is structurally similar across different molecules. The concept of DeepEOSNet can easily be transferred to other ML architectures in molecular context, and thus provides a viable option for property prediction.</p></details> |  |

We integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) together. Firstly, we apply NLP on the user-generated text and conduct semantic analysis, sentiment recognition and keyword extraction to get subtle risk signals from social media posts. Meanwhile, we build a heterogeneous user relationship graph based on social interaction and propose a novel relational graph convolutional network to model user relationship, attention relationship and content dissemination path to discover some important structural information and user behaviors. Finally, we combine textual features extracted from these two models above with graph structural information, which provides a more robust and effective way to discover at-risk users. Our experiments on real social media datasets from different platforms show that our model can achieve significant improvement over single-modality methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tighter Bounds for Personalized PageRank](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14462v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Personalized PageRank (PPR), where for nodes $s,t$ in a graph $G$, $\pi(s,t)$ is the probability that an $\alpha$-decay random walk from $s$ ends at $t$. Two key queries are: Single-Source PPR (SSPPR), computing $\pi(s,\cdot)$ for fixed $s$, and Single-Target PPR (STPPR), computing $\pi(\cdot,t)$ for fixed $t$. SSPPR is studied under absolute error (SSPPR-A), requiring $|\hat{\pi}(s,t)-\pi(s,t)|\le \epsilon$, and relative error (SSPPR-R), requiring $|\hat{\pi}(s,t)-\pi(s,t)|\le c\pi(s,t)$ for $t$ with $\pi(s,t)\ge \delta$; STPPR adopts the same relative criterion. These queries support web search, recommendation, sparsification, and graph neural networks. The best known upper bounds are $O(\min(\tfrac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\epsilon^{2}},\tfrac{\sqrt{m\log n}}{\epsilon},m\log\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}))$ for SSPPR-A and $O(\min(\tfrac{\log(1/\delta)}{\delta},\sqrt{\tfrac{m\log n}{\delta}},m\log\tfrac{\log n}{\delta m}))$ for SSPPR-R, while lower bounds remain $\Omega(\min(n,1/\epsilon))$, $\Omega(\min(m,1/\delta))$, and $\Omega(\min(n,1/\delta))$, leaving large gaps. We close these gaps by (i) presenting a Monte Carlo algorithm that tightens the SSPPR-A upper bound to $O(1/\epsilon^{2})$, and (ii) proving, via an arc-centric construction, lower bounds $\Omega(\min(m,\tfrac{\log(1/\delta)}{\delta}))$ for SSPPR-R, $\Omega(\min(m,\tfrac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}))$ (and intermediate $\Omega(\min(m,\tfrac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\epsilon}))$) for SSPPR-A, and $\Omega(\min(m,\tfrac{n}{\delta}\log n))$ for STPPR. For practical settings ($\delta=\Theta(1/n)$, $\epsilon=\Theta(n^{-1/2})$, $m\in\Omega(n\log n)$) these bounds meet the best known upper bounds, establishing the optimality of Monte Carlo and FORA for SSPPR-R, our algorithm for SSPPR-A, and RBS for STPPR, and yielding a near-complete complexity landscape for PPR queries.</p></details> | 43 pages |
| **[Diffusion Graph Neural Networks and Dataset for Robust Olfactory Navigation in Hazard Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00455v4)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation by scent is a capability in robotic systems that is rising in demand. However, current methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address challenges in olfactory navigation, we introduce a multimodal olfaction dataset along with a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines. This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and training methods, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors, enabling them to detect more compounds and inform better hardware design. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound in critical applications such as explosives detection, narcotics screening, and search and rescue. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.

While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Transition State Searches by Freezing String Method with Graph Neural Network Potentials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06159v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transition state (TS) searches are a critical bottleneck in computational studies of chemical reactivity, as accurately capturing complex phenomena like bond breaking and formation events requires repeated evaluations of expensive ab-initio potential energy surfaces (PESs). While numerous algorithms have been developed to locate TSs efficiently, the computational cost of PES evaluations remains a key limitation. In this work, we develop and fine-tune a graph neural network (GNN) PES to accelerate TS searches for organic reactions. Our GNN of choice, SchNet, is first pre-trained on the ANI-1 dataset and subsequently fine-tuned on a small dataset of reactant, product, and TS structures. We integrate this GNN PES into the Freezing String Method (FSM), enabling rapid generation of TS guess geometries. Across a benchmark suite of chemically diverse reactions, our fine-tuned model (GNN-FT) achieves a 100% success rate, locating the reference TSs in all cases while reducing the number of ab-initio calculations by 72% on average compared to conventional DFT-based FSM searches. Fine-tuning reduces GNN-FT errors by orders of magnitude for out-of-distribution cases such as non-covalent interactions, and improves TS-region predictions with comparatively little data. Analysis of transition state geometries and energy errors shows that GNN-FT captures PES along the reaction coordinate with sufficient accuracy to serve as a reliable DFT surrogate. These results demonstrate that modern GNN potentials, when properly trained, can significantly reduce the cost of TS searches and broaden the scope and size of systems considered in chemical reactivity studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, such data are inherently heterogeneous, high-dimensional, and exhibit complex intra- and inter-modality dependencies. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer powerful tools for modeling such structure. Yet, most existing methods rely on prior knowledge or predefined similarity networks to construct graphs, which are often undirected or unweighted, failing to capture the directionality and strength of biological interactions. Interpretability at both the modality and feature levels also remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose TF-DWGNet, a novel Graph Neural Network framework that combines tree-based Directed Weighted graph construction with Tensor Fusion for multiclass cancer subtype classification. TF-DWGNet introduces two key innovations: a supervised tree-based approach for constructing directed, weighted graphs tailored to each omics modality, and a tensor fusion mechanism that captures unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal interactions using low-rank decomposition for efficiency. TF-DWGNet enables modality-specific representation learning, joint embedding fusion, and interpretable subtype prediction. Experiments on real-world cancer datasets show that TF-DWGNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics and statistical tests. Moreover, it provides biologically meaningful insights by ranking influential features and modalities. These results highlight TF-DWGNet's potential for effective and interpretable multi-omics integration in cancer research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Compose by Focus: Scene Graph-based Atomic Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16053v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key requirement for generalist robots is compositional generalization - the ability to combine atomic skills to solve complex, long-horizon tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on synthesizing a planner that sequences pre-learned skills, robust execution of the individual skills themselves remains challenging, as visuomotor policies often fail under distribution shifts induced by scene composition. To address this, we introduce a scene graph-based representation that focuses on task-relevant objects and relations, thereby mitigating sensitivity to irrelevant variation. Building on this idea, we develop a scene-graph skill learning framework that integrates graph neural networks with diffusion-based imitation learning, and further combine "focused" scene-graph skills with a vision-language model (VLM) based task planner. Experiments in both simulation and real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate substantially higher success rates than state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting improved robustness and compositional generalization in long-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions, including graph rewiring and bottleneck-resistant architectures such as Cayley and expander graphs, avoid this problem but introduce scalability bottlenecks. In particular, the Cayley graphs constructed over $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ exhibit strong theoretical properties, yet suffer from cubic node growth $O(n^3)$, leading to high memory usage. To address this, this work introduces Schrier-Coset Graph Propagation (SCGP), a group-theoretic augmentation method that enriches node features through Schreier-coset embeddings without altering the input graph topology. SCGP embeds bottleneck-free connectivity patterns into a compact feature space, improving long-range message passing while maintaining computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations across standard node and graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that SCGP achieves performance comparable to, or exceeding, expander graph and rewired GNN baselines. Furthermore, SCGP exhibits particular advantages in processing hierarchical and modular graph structures, offering reduced inference latency, improved scalability, and a low memory footprint, making it suitable for real-time and resource-constrained applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been updated and now utilizes a more comprehensive methodology, we felt that the name does not do justice to it as their is no graph rewiring involved.

Open in-situ datasets from principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual annotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage often leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep learning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address this issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically coherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a minimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain underexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially in the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address this gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for systematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale land cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both input-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation by postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models. Additionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to improve performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff between accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our results show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps. Input-level aggregation proves more robust on smaller datasets, whereas output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several configurations of LC-SLab also outperform existing land cover products, highlighting the framework's practical utility.</p></details> |  |

However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather prediction service.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy</p></details> |

The current industry practice in semiconductor manufacturing typically applies heuristic rules to prioritize actions, such as future change lists that account for incoming machine and recipe dedications. However, while offering interpretability, heuristics cannot easily account for the complex interactions along the process flow that can gradually lead to the formation of bottlenecks. Here, we present a neural network-based model for capacity planning on the level of individual machines, trained using deep reinforcement learning. By representing the policy using a heterogeneous graph neural network, the model directly captures the diverse relationships among machines and processing steps, allowing for proactive decision-making. We describe several measures taken to achieve sufficient scalability to tackle the vast space of possible machine-level actions. Our evaluation results cover Intel's small-scale Minifab model and preliminary experiments using the popular SMT2020 testbed. In the largest tested scenario, our trained policy increases throughput and decreases cycle time by about 1.8% each.</p></details> |  |

It employs an online data quality monitoring (DQM) system to promptly spot and diagnose particle data acquisition problems to avoid data quality loss. In this study, we present a semi-supervised spatio-temporal anomaly detection (AD) monitoring system for the physics particle reading channels of the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) of the CMS using three-dimensional digi-occupancy map data of the DQM. We propose the GraphSTAD system, which employs convolutional and graph neural networks to learn local spatial characteristics induced by particles traversing the detector and the global behavior owing to shared backend circuit connections and housing boxes of the channels, respectively. Recurrent neural networks capture the temporal evolution of the extracted spatial features. We validate the accuracy of the proposed AD system in capturing diverse channel fault types using the LHC collision data sets. The GraphSTAD system achieves production-level accuracy and is being integrated into the CMS core production system for real-time monitoring of the HCAL.

However, most approaches are tailored for undirected graphs, neglecting the abundant information in the edges of directed graphs (digraphs). In fact, digraphs are widely applied in the real world and confirmed to address heterophily challenges. Despite recent advancements, existing spatial- and spectral-based DiGNNs have limitations due to their complex learning mechanisms and reliance on high-quality topology, resulting in low efficiency and unstable performance. To address these issues, we propose Directed Random Walk (DiRW), a plug-and-play strategy for most spatial-based DiGNNs and also an innovative model which offers a new digraph learning paradigm. Specifically, it utilizes a direction-aware path sampler optimized from the perspectives of walk probability, length, and number in a weight-free manner by considering node profiles and topologies. Building upon this, DiRW incorporates a node-wise learnable path aggregator for generalized node representations. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that DiRW: (1) enhances most spatial-based methods as a plug-and-play strategy; (2) achieves SOTA performance as a new digraph learning paradigm.

When data points are connected by a network, the induced dependency between samples is both a challenge, reducing effective sample size, and an opportunity to improve prediction by leveraging information from network neighbors. Multiple methods taking advantage of this opportunity are now available, but many, including graph neural networks, are not easily interpretable, limiting their usefulness for understanding how a model makes its predictions. Others, such as network-assisted linear regression, are interpretable but often yield substantially worse prediction performance. We bridge this gap by proposing a family of flexible network-assisted models built upon a generalization of random forests (RF+), which achieves highly-competitive prediction accuracy and can be interpreted through feature importance measures. In particular, we develop a suite of interpretation tools that enable practitioners to not only identify important features that drive model predictions, but also quantify the importance of the network contribution to prediction. Importantly, we provide both global and local importance measures as well as sample influence measures to assess the impact of a given observation. This suite of tools broadens the scope and applicability of network-assisted machine learning for high-impact problems where interpretability and transparency are essential.</p></details> |  |

To address this, model-level interpretation methods have been developed to explain what patterns maximize probability of predicting to a certain class. However, existing model-level interpretation methods pose several limitations such as generating invalid explanation graphs and lacking reliability. In this paper, we propose a new Generative Interpretation Network for Model-Level Explanation of Graph Neural Networks (GIN-Graph), to generate reliable and high-quality model-level explanation graphs. The implicit and likelihood-free generative adversarial networks are exploited to construct the explanation graphs which are similar to original graphs, meanwhile maximizing the prediction probability for a certain class by adopting a novel objective function for generator with dynamic loss weight scheme. Experimental results indicate that GIN-Graph can be applied to interpret GNNs trained on a variety of graph datasets and generate high-quality explanation graphs with high stability and reliability.</p></details> |  |

For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted.

However, their application to graph structured data, where capturing topological connections is essential, remains underexplored and underperforming compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly in the graph clustering task. GNN tends to overemphasize neighborhood aggregation, leading to a homogenization of node representations. Conversely, Transformer tends to over globalize, highlighting distant nodes at the expense of meaningful local patterns. This dichotomy raises a key question: Is attention inherently redundant for unsupervised graph learning? To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, uncovering the complementary weaknesses of GNN and Transformer in graph clustering. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN) a novel architecture that reinterprets the notion that graph is attention. AGCN directly embeds the attention mechanism into the graph structure, enabling effective global information extraction while maintaining sensitivity to local topological cues. Our framework incorporates theoretical analysis to contrast AGCN behavior with GNN and Transformer and introduces two innovations: (1) a KV cache mechanism to improve computational efficiency, and (2) a pairwise margin contrastive loss to boost the discriminative capacity of the attention space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

To solve this problem, exact solution methods based on column generation have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel partial column generation strategy for settings with multiple pricing problems, based on predicting which ones are likely to yield columns with a negative reduced cost. We develop a machine learning model tailored to the team formation and routing problem that leverages graph neural networks for these predictions. Computational experiments demonstrate that applying our strategy enhances the solution method and outperforms traditional partial column generation approaches from the literature, particularly on hard instances solved under a tight time limit.</p></details> | 30 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Exploring the Global-to-Local Attention Scheme in Graph Transformers: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14863v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) show considerable potential in graph representation learning. The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer, featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping linear complexity.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their robustness, especially on heterogeneous graphs, remains underexplored, particularly against adversarial attacks. This paper proposes HeteroKRLAttack, a targeted evasion black-box attack method for heterogeneous graphs. By integrating reinforcement learning with a Top-K algorithm to reduce the action space, our method efficiently identifies effective attack strategies to disrupt node classification tasks. We validate the effectiveness of HeteroKRLAttack through experiments on multiple heterogeneous graph datasets, showing significant reductions in classification accuracy compared to baseline methods. An ablation study underscores the critical role of the Top-K algorithm in enhancing attack performance. Our findings highlight potential vulnerabilities in current models and provide guidance for future defense strategies against adversarial attacks on heterogeneous graphs.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods exhibit limited performance when handling hypergraphs, which inherently represent complex high-order relationships beyond pairwise connections. Partitioning hypergraph structures across federated subsystems amplifies structural complexity, hindering high-order information mining and compromising local information integrity. To bridge the gap between hypergraph learning and federated systems, we develop FedHGL, a first-of-its-kind framework for federated hypergraph learning on disjoint and privacy-constrained hypergraph partitions. Beyond collaboratively training a comprehensive hypergraph neural network across multiple clients, FedHGL introduces a pre-propagation hyperedge completion mechanism to preserve high-order structural integrity within each client. This procedure leverages the federated central server to perform cross-client hypergraph convolution without exposing internal topological information, effectively mitigating the high-order information loss induced by subgraph partitioning. Furthermore, by incorporating two kinds of local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms, we provide formal privacy guarantees for this process, ensuring that sensitive node features remain protected against inference attacks from potentially malicious servers or clients. Experimental results on seven real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its performance advantages over traditional federated graph learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Data Mining 2025 (ICDM2025)</p></details> |
| **[General Geospatial Inference with a Population Dynamics Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07207v5)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supporting the health and well-being of dynamic populations around the world requires governmental agencies, organizations and researchers to understand and reason over complex relationships between human behavior and local contexts in order to identify high-risk groups and strategically allocate limited resources. Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting. The full set of embeddings and sample code are publicly available for researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, preprint; v5: updated authors</p></details> |
| **[Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Sample-Efficient and Generalizable Swarm Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14431v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for coordinating swarms of agents in complex decision-making, yet major challenges remain. In competitive settings such as pursuer-evader tasks, simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (LEGO) framework, which integrates seamlessly with popular MARL algorithms such as MAPPO. LEGO employs graph neural networks to capture permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers, canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous representations to encode role-specific inductive biases. Experiments on cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks show that LEGO outperforms strong baselines and improves generalization. In real-world experiments, LEGO demonstrates robustness to varying team sizes and agent failure.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[How Bad Is Forming Your Own Multidimensional Opinion?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14411v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the formation of opinions on interconnected topics within social networks is of significant importance. It offers insights into collective behavior and decision-making, with applications in Graph Neural Networks. Existing models propose that individuals form opinions based on a weighted average of their peers' opinions and their own beliefs. This averaging process, viewed as a best-response game, can be seen as an individual minimizing disagreements with peers, defined by a quadratic penalty, leading to an equilibrium. Bindel, Kleinberg, and Oren (FOCS 2011) provided tight bounds on the "price of anarchy" defined as the maximum overall disagreement at equilibrium relative to a social optimum. Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala (STOC 2013) generalized the penalty function to non-quadratic penalties and provided tight bounds on the price of anarchy. When considering multiple topics, an individual's opinions can be represented as a vector. Parsegov, Proskurnikov, Tempo, and Friedkin (2016) proposed a multidimensional model using the weighted averaging process, but with constant interdependencies between topics. However, the question of the price of anarchy for this model remained open. We address this by providing tight bounds on the multidimensional model, while also generalizing it to more complex interdependencies. Following the work of Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala, we provide tight bounds on the price of anarchy under non-quadratic penalties. Surprisingly, these bounds match the scalar model. We further demonstrate that the bounds remain unchanged even when adding another layer of complexity, involving groups of individuals minimizing their overall internal and external disagreement penalty, a common occurrence in real-life scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in 26th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC'25)</p></details> |

However, current staging models are hardly interpretable, and most public datasets contain no clinical reasoning or interpretation beyond image-level labels. In this paper, we present a novel method that integrates graph representation learning with vision-language models (VLMs) to deliver explainable DR diagnosis. Our approach leverages optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images by constructing biologically informed graphs that encode key retinal vascular features such as vessel morphology and spatial connectivity. A graph neural network (GNN) then performs DR staging while integrated gradients highlight critical nodes and edges and their individual features that drive the classification decisions. We collect this graph-based knowledge which attributes the model's prediction to physiological structures and their characteristics. We then transform it into textual descriptions for VLMs. We perform instruction-tuning with these textual descriptions and the corresponding image to train a student VLM. This final agent can classify the disease and explain its decision in a human interpretable way solely based on a single image input. Experimental evaluations on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate that our method not only improves classification accuracy but also offers more clinically interpretable results. An expert study further demonstrates that our method provides more accurate diagnostic explanations and paves the way for precise localization of pathologies in OCTA images.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

Existing studies remain fragmented, and there is a lack of comprehensive guidance on how GNNs can be systematically applied to NG-IoT systems. As NG-IoT systems evolve toward 6G, they incorporate diverse technologies. These advances promise unprecedented connectivity, sensing, and automation but also introduce significant complexity, requiring new approaches for scalable learning, dynamic optimization, and secure, decentralized decision-making. This survey provides a comprehensive and forward-looking exploration of how GNNs can empower NG-IoT environments. We commence by exploring the fundamental paradigms of GNNs and articulating the motivation for their use in NG-IoT networks. Besides, we intrinsically connect GNNs with the family of low-density parity-check codes, modeling the NG-IoT as dynamic constrained graphs. We highlight the distinct roles of node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks in tackling key challenges and demonstrate the GNNs' ability to overcome the limitations of traditional optimization. We examine the application of GNNs across core NG-enabling technologies and their integration with distributed frameworks to support privacy-preservation and distributed intelligence. We then delve into the challenges posed by adversarial attacks, offering insights into defense mechanisms. Lastly, we examine how GNNs can be integrated with emerging technologies. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of GNNs in improving efficiency, scalability, and security. Finally, we summarize the key lessons learned and outline promising future research directions, along with a set of design guidelines tailored for NG-IoT applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 18 figures, and 6 tables.

| **[An End-to-End Differentiable, Graph Neural Network-Embedded Pore Network Model for Permeability Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13841v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of permeability in porous media is essential for modeling subsurface flow. While pure data-driven models offer computational efficiency, they often lack generalization across scales and do not incorporate explicit physical constraints. Pore network models (PNMs), on the other hand, are physics-based and efficient but rely on idealized geometric assumptions to estimate pore-scale hydraulic conductance, limiting their accuracy in complex structures. To overcome these limitations, we present an end-to-end differentiable hybrid framework that embeds a graph neural network (GNN) into a PNM. In this framework, the analytical formulas used for conductance calculations are replaced by GNN-based predictions derived from pore and throat features. The predicted conductances are then passed to the PNM solver for permeability computation. In this way, the model avoids the idealized geometric assumptions of PNM while preserving the physics-based flow calculations. The GNN is trained without requiring labeled conductance data, which can number in the thousands per pore network; instead, it learns conductance values by using a single scalar permeability as the training target. This is made possible by backpropagating gradients through both the GNN (via automatic differentiation) and the PNM solver (via a discrete adjoint method), enabling fully coupled, end-to-end training. The resulting model achieves high accuracy and generalizes well across different scales, outperforming both pure data-driven and traditional PNM approaches. Gradient-based sensitivity analysis further reveals physically consistent feature influences, enhancing model interpretability. This approach offers a scalable and physically informed framework for permeability prediction in complex porous media, reducing model uncertainty and improving accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint is also available at ESS Open Archive: https://essopenarchive.org/users/960205/articles/1329010</p></details> |
| **[State Space Models over Directed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13735v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed graphs are ubiquitous across numerous domains, where the directionality of edges encodes critical causal dependencies. However, existing GNNs and graph Transformers tailored for directed graphs face two major challenges: (1) effectively capturing long-range causal dependencies derived from directed edges; (2) balancing accuracy and training efficiency when processing large-scale graph datasets. In recent years, state space models (SSMs) have achieved substantial progress in causal sequence tasks, and their variants designed for graphs have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining high efficiency across various graph learning benchmarks. However, existing graph state space models are exclusively designed for undirected graphs, which limits their performance in directed graph learning. To this end, we propose an innovative approach DirEgo2Token which sequentializes directed graphs via k-hop ego graphs. This marks the first systematic extension of state space models to the field of directed graph learning. Building upon this, we develop DirGraphSSM, a novel directed graph neural network architecture that implements state space models on directed graphs via the message-passing mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that DirGraphSSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three representative directed graph learning tasks while attaining competitive performance on two additional tasks with 1.5$\times $ to 2$\times $ training speed improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently undergoing review by IEEE Transactions on Big Data</p></details> |

One common challenge is the ability to optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to 16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, preprint</p></details> |

Although multimodal classification approaches integrating information from several modalities outperform unimodal ones, they typically neglect that even minimal hateful content defines a video's category. Specifically, they generally treat all content uniformly, instead of emphasizing the hateful components. Additionally, existing multimodal methods cannot systematically capture structured information in videos, limiting the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal dual-stream graph neural network model. It constructs an instance graph by separating the given video into several instances to extract instance-level features. Then, a complementary weight graph assigns importance weights to these features, highlighting hateful instances. Importance weights and instance features are combined to generate video labels. Our model employs a graph-based framework to systematically model structured relationships within and across modalities. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our model is state-of-the-art in hateful video classification and has strong explainability.

| **[JANUS: A Dual-Constraint Generative Framework for Stealthy Node Injection Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13266v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework, called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack effectiveness and stealthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Heterophilic Graphs: A Spectral Theory Perspective on the Impact of Self-Loops and Parallel Edges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13139v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph heterophily poses a formidable challenge to the performance of Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). The familiar low-pass filters like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) face performance degradation, which can be attributed to the blending of the messages from dissimilar neighboring nodes. The performance of the low-pass filters on heterophilic graphs still requires an in-depth analysis. In this context, we update the heterophilic graphs by adding a number of self-loops and parallel edges. We observe that eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian decrease and increase respectively by increasing the number of self-loops and parallel edges. We conduct several studies regarding the performance of GCN on various benchmark heterophilic networks by adding either self-loops or parallel edges. The studies reveal that the GCN exhibited either increasing or decreasing performance trends on adding self-loops and parallel edges. In light of the studies, we established connections between the graph spectra and the performance trends of the low-pass filters on the heterophilic graphs. The graph spectra characterize the essential intrinsic properties of the input graph like the presence of connected components, sparsity, average degree, cluster structures, etc. Our work is adept at seamlessly evaluating graph spectrum and properties by observing the performance trends of the low-pass filters without pursuing the costly eigenvalue decomposition. The theoretical foundations are also discussed to validate the impact of adding self-loops and parallel edges on the graph spectrum.</p></details> |  |

We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\) nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged; only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%. Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through plateaus.</p></details> |  |

Our method exploits the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to enable efficient spectral decomposition while preserving high-frequency components. We further provide rigorous over-smoothing and stability analysis under graph perturbations, establishing a solid theoretical foundation.
