| **[A Hybrid Recommender System for Recommending Smartphones to Prospective Customers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12876v2)** | 2022-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender Systems are a subclass of machine learning systems that employ sophisticated information filtering strategies to reduce the search time and suggest the most relevant items to any particular user. Hybrid recommender systems combine multiple recommendation strategies in different ways to benefit from their complementary advantages. Some hybrid recommender systems have combined collaborative filtering and content-based approaches to build systems that are more robust. In this paper, we propose a hybrid recommender system, which combines Alternating Least Squares (ALS) based collaborative filtering with deep learning to enhance recommendation performance as well as overcome the limitations associated with the collaborative filtering approach, especially concerning its cold start problem. In essence, we use the outputs from ALS (collaborative filtering) to influence the recommendations from a Deep Neural Network (DNN), which combines characteristic, contextual, structural and sequential information, in a big data processing framework. We have conducted several experiments in testing the efficacy of the proposed hybrid architecture in recommending smartphones to prospective customers and compared its performance with other open-source recommenders. The results have shown that the proposed system has outperformed several existing hybrid recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exper...</summary><p>Expert Systems With Applications, 2022</p></details> |
| **[Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.1112v1)** | 2015-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ongoing rapid expansion of the Internet greatly increases the necessity of effective recommender systems for filtering the abundant information. Extensive research for recommender systems is conducted by a broad range of communities including social and computer scientists, physicists, and interdisciplinary researchers. Despite substantial theoretical and practical achievements, unification and comparison of different approaches are lacking, which impedes further advances. In this article, we review recent developments in recommender systems and discuss the major challenges. We compare and evaluate available algorithms and examine their roles in the future developments. In addition to algorithms, physical aspects are described to illustrate macroscopic behavior of recommender systems. Potential impacts and future directions are discussed. We emphasize that recommendation has a great scientific depth and combines diverse research fields which makes it of interests for physicists as well as interdisciplinary researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>97 pa...</summary><p>97 pages, 20 figures (To appear in Physics Reports)</p></details> |
| **[Recommender Systems: A Primer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02579v1)** | 2023-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized recommendations have become a common feature of modern online services, including most major e-commerce sites, media platforms and social networks. Today, due to their high practical relevance, research in the area of recommender systems is flourishing more than ever. However, with the new application scenarios of recommender systems that we observe today, constantly new challenges arise as well, both in terms of algorithmic requirements and with respect to the evaluation of such systems. In this paper, we first provide an overview of the traditional formulation of the recommendation problem. We then review the classical algorithmic paradigms for item retrieval and ranking and elaborate how such systems can be evaluated. Afterwards, we discuss a number of recent developments in recommender systems research, including research on session-based recommendation, biases in recommender systems, and questions regarding the impact and value of recommender systems in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey Paper on Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.5278v4)** | 2016-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems apply data mining techniques and prediction algorithms to predict users' interest on information, products and services among the tremendous amount of available items. The vast growth of information on the Internet as well as number of visitors to websites add some key challenges to recommender systems. These are: producing accurate recommendation, handling many recommendations efficiently and coping with the vast growth of number of participants in the system. Therefore, new recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations even for huge data sets. To address these issues we have explored several collaborative filtering techniques such as the item based approach, which identify relationship between items and indirectly compute recommendations for users based on these relationships. The user based approach was also studied, it identifies relationships between users of similar tastes and computes recommendations based on these relationships. In this paper, we introduce the topic of recommender system. It provides ways to evaluate efficiency, scalability and accuracy of recommender system. The paper also analyzes different algorithms of user based and item based techniques for recommendation generation. Moreover, a simple experiment was conducted using a data mining application -Weka- to apply data mining algorithms to recommender system. We conclude by proposing our approach that might enhance the quality of recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has some typos in it</p></details> |
| **[Impression-Aware Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07857v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel data sources bring new opportunities to improve the quality of recommender systems and serve as a catalyst for the creation of new paradigms on personalized recommendations. Impressions are a novel data source containing the items shown to users on their screens. Past research focused on providing personalized recommendations using interactions, and occasionally using impressions when such a data source was available. Interest in impressions has increased due to their potential to provide more accurate recommendations. Despite this increased interest, research in recommender systems using impressions is still dispersed. Many works have distinct interpretations of impressions and use impressions in recommender systems in numerous different manners. To unify those interpretations into a single framework, we present a systematic literature review on recommender systems using impressions, focusing on three fundamental perspectives: recommendation models, datasets, and evaluation methodologies. We define a theoretical framework to delimit recommender systems using impressions and a novel paradigm for personalized recommendations, called impression-aware recommender systems. We propose a classification system for recommenders in this paradigm, which we use to categorize the recommendation models, datasets, and evaluation methodologies used in past research. Lastly, we identify open questions and future directions, highlighting missing aspects in the reviewed literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 127 references, 6 tables, 5 figures, ACM TORS ACCEPTED</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on the Fairness of Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.03761v2)** | 2022-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are an essential tool to relieve the information overload challenge and play an important role in people's daily lives. Since recommendations involve allocations of social resources (e.g., job recommendation), an important issue is whether recommendations are fair. Unfair recommendations are not only unethical but also harm the long-term interests of the recommender system itself. As a result, fairness issues in recommender systems have recently attracted increasing attention. However, due to multiple complex resource allocation processes and various fairness definitions, the research on fairness in recommendation is scattered. To fill this gap, we review over 60 papers published in top conferences/journals, including TOIS, SIGIR, and WWW. First, we summarize fairness definitions in the recommendation and provide several views to classify fairness issues. Then, we review recommendation datasets and measurements in fairness studies and provide an elaborate taxonomy of fairness methods in the recommendation. Finally, we conclude this survey by outlining some promising future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Special Section on Trustworthy Recommendation and Search of ACM TOIS on March 27, 2022 and accepted on June 6</p></details> |
| **[The Amplification Paradox in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.11225v2)** | 2023-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated audits of recommender systems found that blindly following recommendations leads users to increasingly partisan, conspiratorial, or false content. At the same time, studies using real user traces suggest that recommender systems are not the primary driver of attention toward extreme content; on the contrary, such content is mostly reached through other means, e.g., other websites. In this paper, we explain the following apparent paradox: if the recommendation algorithm favors extreme content, why is it not driving its consumption? With a simple agent-based model where users attribute different utilities to items in the recommender system, we show through simulations that the collaborative-filtering nature of recommender systems and the nicheness of extreme content can resolve the apparent paradox: although blindly following recommendations would indeed lead users to niche content, users rarely consume niche content when given the option because it is of low utility to them, which can lead the recommender system to deamplify such content. Our results call for a nuanced interpretation of ``algorithmic amplification'' and highlight the importance of modeling the utility of content to users when auditing recommender systems.

| **[An MDP-based Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.0600v2)** | 2015-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical Recommender systems adopt a static view of the recommendation process and treat it as a prediction problem. We argue that it is more appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendations as a sequential decision problem and, consequently, that Markov decision processes (MDP) provide a more appropriate model for Recommender systems. MDPs introduce two benefits: they take into account the long-term effects of each recommendation, and they take into account the expected value of each recommendation. To succeed in practice, an MDP-based Recommender system must employ a strong initial model; and the bulk of this paper is concerned with the generation of such a model. In particular, we suggest the use of an n-gram predictive model for generating the initial MDP. Our n-gram model induces a Markov-chain model of user behavior whose predictive accuracy is greater than that of existing predictive models. We describe our predictive model in detail and evaluate its performance on real data. In addition, we show how the model can be used in an MDP-based Recommender system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in Proceedings of the Eighteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2002)</p></details> |

The implementation of these functions has implications for the choices at the heart of algorithmic recommender systems. - A state of the art, which deals with the main techniques used in automated recommendation system: the two most commonly used algorithmic methods, the K-Nearest-Neighbor methods (KNN) and the fast factorization methods are detailed.

| **[Estimating Probabilities in Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.0498v1)** | 2010-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems are emerging as an important business application with significant economic impact. Currently popular systems include Amazon's book recommendations, Netflix's movie recommendations, and Pandora's music recommendations. In this paper we address the problem of estimating probabilities associated with recommendation system data using non-parametric kernel smoothing. In our estimation we interpret missing items as randomly censored observations and obtain efficient computation schemes using combinatorial properties of generating functions. We demonstrate our approach with several case studies involving real world movie recommendation data. The results are comparable with state-of-the-art techniques while also providing probabilistic preference estimates outside the scope of traditional recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Brief History of Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.01860v1)** | 2022-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soon after the invention of the Internet, the recommender system emerged and related technologies have been extensively studied and applied by both academia and industry. Currently, recommender system has become one of the most successful web applications, serving billions of people in each day through recommending different kinds of contents, including news feeds, videos, e-commerce products, music, movies, books, games, friends, jobs etc. These successful stories have proved that recommender system can transfer big data to high values. This article briefly reviews the history of web recommender systems, mainly from two aspects: (1) recommendation models, (2) architectures of typical recommender systems. We hope the brief review can help us to know the dots about the progress of web recommender systems, and the dots will somehow connect in the future, which inspires us to build more advanced recommendation services for changing the world better.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying the Effects of Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.01077v1)** | 2020-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems today exert a strong influence on consumer behavior and individual perceptions of the world. By using collaborative filtering (CF) methods to create recommendations, it generates a continuous feedback loop in which user behavior becomes magnified in the algorithmic system. Popular items get recommended more frequently, creating the bias that affects and alters user preferences. In order to visualize and compare the different biases, we will analyze the effects of recommendation systems and quantify the inequalities resulting from them.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, accepted into the National Symposium of IEEE Big Data 2019</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08675v3)** | 2016-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recommendation system uses the past purchases or ratings of $n$ products by a group of $m$ users, in order to provide personalized recommendations to individual users. The information is modeled as an $m \times n$ preference matrix which is assumed to have a good rank-$k$ approximation, for a small constant $k$. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for recommendation systems that has running time $O(\text{poly}(k)\text{polylog}(mn))$. All known classical algorithms for recommendation systems that work through reconstructing an approximation of the preference matrix run in time polynomial in the matrix dimension. Our algorithm provides good recommendations by sampling efficiently from an approximation of the preference matrix, without reconstructing the entire matrix. For this, we design an efficient quantum procedure to project a given vector onto the row space of a given matrix. This is the first algorithm for recommendation systems that runs in time polylogarithmic in the dimensions of the matrix and provides an example of a quantum machine learning algorithm for a real world application.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[A Survey on Federated Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00767v2)** | 2023-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning has recently been applied to recommendation systems to protect user privacy. In federated learning settings, recommendation systems can train recommendation models only collecting the intermediate parameters instead of the real user data, which greatly enhances the user privacy. Beside, federated recommendation systems enable to collaborate with other data platforms to improve recommended model performance while meeting the regulation and privacy constraints. However, federated recommendation systems faces many new challenges such as privacy, security, heterogeneity and communication costs. While significant research has been conducted in these areas, gaps in the surveying literature still exist. In this survey, we-(1) summarize some common privacy mechanisms used in federated recommendation systems and discuss the advantages and limitations of each mechanism; (2) review some robust aggregation strategies and several novel attacks against security; (3) summarize some approaches to address heterogeneity and communication costs problems; (4)introduce some open source platforms that can be used to build federated recommendation systems; (5) present some prospective research directions in the future. This survey can guide researchers and practitioners understand the research progress in these areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streaming Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06182v1)** | 2016-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing popularity of real-world recommender systems produces data continuously and rapidly, and it becomes more realistic to study recommender systems under streaming scenarios. Data streams present distinct properties such as temporally ordered, continuous and high-velocity, which poses tremendous challenges to traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of recommendation with stream inputs. In particular, we provide a principled framework termed sRec, which provides explicit continuous-time random process models of the creation of users and topics, and of the evolution of their interests. A variational Bayesian approach called recursive meanfield approximation is proposed, which permits computationally efficient instantaneous on-line inference. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of our sRec over other state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |

However, in many real-world applications, there are other stakeholders whose needs and interests should be taken into account. In this work, we define the problem of multistakeholder recommendation and we focus on finding algorithms for a special case where the recommender system itself is also a stakeholder. In addition, we will explore the idea of incremental incorporation of system-level objectives into recommender systems over time to tackle the existing problems in the optimization techniques which only look for optimizing the individual users' lists.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1901.07555</p></details> |
| **[Designing Explanations for Group Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12413v1)** | 2021-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explanations are used in recommender systems for various reasons. Users have to be supported in making (high-quality) decisions more quickly. Developers of recommender systems want to convince users to purchase specific items. Users should better understand how the recommender system works and why a specific item has been recommended. Users should also develop a more in-depth understanding of the item domain. Consequently, explanations are designed in order to achieve specific \emph{goals} such as increasing the transparency of a recommendation or increasing a user's trust in the recommender system. In this paper, we provide an overview of existing research related to explanations in recommender systems, and specifically discuss aspects relevant to group recommendation scenarios. In this context, we present different ways of explaining and visualizing recommendations determined on the basis of preference aggregation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Cite ...</summary><p>Cite as: A.

| **[A Survey on Trustworthy Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.12515v2)** | 2024-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RS), serving at the forefront of Human-centered AI, are widely deployed in almost every corner of the web and facilitate the human decision-making process. However, despite their enormous capabilities and potential, RS may also lead to undesired effects on users, items, producers, platforms, or even the society at large, such as compromised user trust due to non-transparency, unfair treatment of different consumers, or producers, privacy concerns due to extensive use of user's private data for personalization, just to name a few. All of these create an urgent need for Trustworthy Recommender Systems (TRS) so as to mitigate or avoid such adverse impacts and risks. In this survey, we will introduce techniques related to trustworthy recommendation, including but not limited to explainable recommendation, fairness in recommendation, privacy-aware recommendation, robustness in recommendation, user-controllable recommendation, as well as the relationship between these different perspectives in terms of trustworthy recommendation. Through this survey, we hope to deliver readers with a comprehensive view of the research area and raise attention to the community about the importance, existing research achievements, and future research directions on trustworthy recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (TORS)</p></details> |

We discuss why hyperbolic geometry is a more suitable underlying geometry for many recommendation systems and cover the fundamental milestones and insights that we have gained from its development. In doing so, we demonstrate the viability of hyperbolic geometry for recommender systems, showing that they significantly outperform Euclidean models on datasets with the properties of complex networks. Key to the success of our approach are the novel choice of underlying hyperbolic model and the use of the Einstein midpoint to define an asymmetric recommender system in hyperbolic space. These choices allow us to scale to millions of users and hundreds of thousands of items.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Review of Clustering-Based Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12839v1)** | 2021-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are one of the most applied methods in machine learning and find applications in many areas, ranging from economics to the Internet of things. This article provides a general overview of modern approaches to recommender system design using clustering as a preliminary step to improve overall performance. Using clustering can address several known issues in recommendation systems, including increasing the diversity, consistency, and reliability of recommendations; the data sparsity of user-preference matrices; and changes in user preferences over time. This work will be useful for both beginners in the field of recommender systems and specialists in related fields that are interested in examining the applicability of recommender systems. This review is focused on the analysis of the scientific literature on the topics of recommender systems and clustering models that have appeared in recent years and contains a representative list of the literature for the further exploration of this topic. In the first part, a brief introduction to the so-called classic or traditional recommendation algorithms is given, along with an overview of the clustering problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 16 equasions</p></details> |
| **[Conformal Group Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12034v1)** | 2023-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group recommender systems (GRS) are critical in discovering relevant items from a near-infinite inventory based on group preferences rather than individual preferences, like recommending a movie, restaurant, or tourist destination to a group of individuals. The traditional models of group recommendation are designed to act like a black box with a strict focus on improving recommendation accuracy, and most often, they place the onus on the users to interpret recommendations. In recent years, the focus of Recommender Systems (RS) research has shifted away from merely improving recommendation accuracy towards value additions such as confidence and explanation. In this work, we propose a conformal prediction framework that provides a measure of confidence with prediction in conjunction with a group recommender system to augment the system-generated plain recommendations. In the context of group recommender systems, we propose various nonconformity measures that play a vital role in the efficiency of the conformal framework. We also show that defined nonconformity satisfies the exchangeability property. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over several benchmark datasets. Furthermore, our proposed approach also satisfies validity and efficiency properties.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[Inductive Conformal Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08949v2)** | 2022-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommendation algorithms develop techniques that can help people to choose desirable items. However, in many real-world applications, along with a set of recommendations, it is also essential to quantify each recommendation's (un)certainty. The conformal recommender system uses the experience of a user to output a set of recommendations, each associated with a precise confidence value. Given a significance level $\varepsilon$, it provides a bound $\varepsilon$ on the probability of making a wrong recommendation. The conformal framework uses a key concept called \emph{nonconformity measure} that measures the strangeness of an item concerning other items. One of the significant design challenges of any conformal recommendation framework is integrating nonconformity measures with the recommendation algorithm. This paper introduces an inductive variant of a conformal recommender system. We propose and analyze different nonconformity measures in the inductive setting. We also provide theoretical proofs on the error-bound and the time complexity. Extensive empirical analysis on ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that the inductive variant substantially improves the performance in computation time while preserving the accuracy.</p></details> | 25 pages |

They are used to personalize user experience, help customers find what they need quickly and efficiently, and increase revenue for the business.

These challenges include limited resources, data validity period, cold start, long tail problem, scalability. In this paper, we discuss the challenges and potential solutions to overcome these challenges. We also discuss the different types of e-commerce recommender systems, their advantages, and disadvantages.

| **[Dynamic Tensor Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05568v1)** | 2020-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have been extensively used by the entertainment industry, business marketing and the biomedical industry. In addition to its capacity of providing preference-based recommendations as an unsupervised learning methodology, it has been also proven useful in sales forecasting, product introduction and other production related businesses. Since some consumers and companies need a recommendation or prediction for future budget, labor and supply chain coordination, dynamic recommender systems for precise forecasting have become extremely necessary. In this article, we propose a new recommendation method, namely the dynamic tensor recommender system (DTRS), which aims particularly at forecasting future recommendation. The proposed method utilizes a tensor-valued function of time to integrate time and contextual information, and creates a time-varying coefficient model for temporal tensor factorization through a polynomial spline approximation. Major advantages of the proposed method include competitive future recommendation predictions and effective prediction interval estimations. In theory, we establish the convergence rate of the proposed tensor factorization and asymptotic normality of the spline coefficient estimator. The proposed method is applied to simulations and IRI marketing data. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of future time forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Commonality in Recommender Systems: Evaluating Recommender Systems to Enhance Cultural Citizenship](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.11360v2)** | 2023-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have become the dominant means of curating cultural content, significantly influencing individual cultural experience. Since recommender systems tend to optimize for personalized user experience, they can overlook impacts on cultural experience in the aggregate. After demonstrating that existing metrics do not center culture, we introduce a new metric, commonality, that measures the degree to which recommendations familiarize a given user population with specified categories of cultural content. We developed commonality through an interdisciplinary dialogue between researchers in computer science and the social sciences and humanities. With reference to principles underpinning public service media systems in democratic societies, we identify universality of address and content diversity in the service of strengthening cultural citizenship as particularly relevant goals for recommender systems delivering cultural content. We develop commonality as a measure of recommender system alignment with the promotion of content toward a shared cultural experience across a population of users. We empirically compare the performance of recommendation algorithms using commonality with existing metrics, demonstrating that commonality captures a novel property of system behavior complementary to existing metrics. Alongside existing fairness and diversity metrics, commonality contributes to a growing body of scholarship developing `public good' rationales for machine learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended version of "Measuring Commonality in Recommendation of Cultural Content: Recommender Systems to Enhance Cultural Citizenship", published at RecSys 2022</p></details> |
| **[Continual Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03861v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern recommender systems operate in uniquely dynamic settings: user interests, item pools, and popularity trends shift continuously, and models must adapt in real time without forgetting past preferences. While existing tutorials on continual or lifelong learning cover broad machine learning domains (e.g., vision and graphs), they do not address recommendation-specific demands-such as balancing stability and plasticity per user, handling cold-start items, and optimizing recommendation metrics under streaming feedback. This tutorial aims to make a timely contribution by filling that gap. We begin by reviewing the background and problem settings, followed by a comprehensive overview of existing approaches. We then highlight recent efforts to apply continual learning to practical deployment environments, such as resource-constrained systems and sequential interaction settings. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future research directions. We expect this tutorial to benefit researchers and practitioners in recommender systems, data mining, AI, and information retrieval across academia and industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMERS: Energy Meter for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15060v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to recent advancements in machine learning, recommender systems use increasingly more energy for training, evaluation, and deployment. However, the recommender systems community often does not report the energy consumption of their experiments. In today's research landscape, no tools exist to easily measure the energy consumption of recommender systems experiments. To bridge this gap, we introduce EMERS, the first software library that simplifies measuring, monitoring, recording, and sharing the energy consumption of recommender systems experiments. EMERS measures energy consumption with smart power plugs and offers a user interface to monitor and compare the energy consumption of recommender systems experiments. Thereby, EMERS improves sustainability awareness and simplifies self-reporting energy consumption for recommender systems practitioners and researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the RecSoGood 2024 Workshop co-located with the 18th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Fairness-aware Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00403v1)** | 2023-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As information filtering services, recommender systems have extremely enriched our daily life by providing personalized suggestions and facilitating people in decision-making, which makes them vital and indispensable to human society in the information era. However, as people become more dependent on them, recent studies show that recommender systems potentially own unintentional impacts on society and individuals because of their unfairness (e.g., gender discrimination in job recommendations). To develop trustworthy services, it is crucial to devise fairness-aware recommender systems that can mitigate these bias issues. In this survey, we summarise existing methodologies and practices of fairness in recommender systems. Firstly, we present concepts of fairness in different recommendation scenarios, comprehensively categorize current advances, and introduce typical methods to promote fairness in different stages of recommender systems. Next, after introducing datasets and evaluation metrics applied to assess the fairness of recommender systems, we will delve into the significant influence that fairness-aware recommender systems exert on real-world industrial applications.

Finally, we summarize this review, spotlighting promising opportunities in comprehending concepts, frameworks, the balance between accuracy and fairness, and the ties with trustworthiness, with the ultimate goal of fostering the development of fairness-aware recommender systems.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |
| **[A Fairness-aware Hybrid Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.09030v1)** | 2018-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are used in variety of domains affecting people's lives. This has raised concerns about possible biases and discrimination that such systems might exacerbate. There are two primary kinds of biases inherent in recommender systems: observation bias and bias stemming from imbalanced data. Observation bias exists due to a feedback loop which causes the model to learn to only predict recommendations similar to previous ones. Imbalance in data occurs when systematic societal, historical, or other ambient bias is present in the data. In this paper, we address both biases by proposing a hybrid fairness-aware recommender system. Our model provides efficient and accurate recommendations by incorporating multiple user-user and item-item similarity measures, content, and demographic information, while addressing recommendation biases. We implement our model using a powerful and expressive probabilistic programming language called probabilistic soft logic. We experimentally evaluate our approach on a popular movie recommendation dataset, showing that our proposed model can provide more accurate and fairer recommendations, compared to a state-of-the art fair recommender system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Overhead-free User-side Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07589v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, recommendation algorithms have been designed for service developers. But recently, a new paradigm called user-side recommender systems has been proposed. User-side recommender systems are built and used by end users, in sharp contrast to traditional provider-side recommender systems. Even if the official recommender system offered by the provider is not fair, end users can create and enjoy their own user-side recommender systems by themselves. Although the concept of user-side recommender systems is attractive, the problem is they require tremendous communication costs between the user and the official system. Even the most efficient user-side recommender systems require about 5 times more costs than provider-side recommender systems. Such high costs hinder the adoption of user-side recommender systems. In this paper, we propose overhead-free user-side recommender systems, RecCycle, which realizes user-side recommender systems without any communication overhead. The main idea of RecCycle is to recycle past recommendation results offered by the provider's recommender systems. The ingredients of RecCycle can be retrieved ``for free,'' and it greatly reduces the cost of user-side recommendations. In the experiments, we confirm that RecCycle performs as well as state-of-the-art user-side recommendation algorithms while RecCycle reduces costs significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2208.09864, arXiv:2403.15757</p></details> |
| **[Intent-Aware Contextual Recommendation System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10558v1)** | 2017-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems take inputs from user history, use an internal ranking algorithm to generate results and possibly optimize this ranking based on feedback. However, often the recommender system is unaware of the actual intent of the user and simply provides recommendations dynamically without properly understanding the thought process of the user. An intelligent recommender system is not only useful for the user but also for businesses which want to learn the tendencies of their users. Finding out tendencies or intents of a user is a difficult problem to solve. Keeping this in mind, we sought out to create an intelligent system which will keep track of the user's activity on a web-application as well as determine the intent of the user in each session. We devised a way to encode the user's activity through the sessions. Then, we have represented the information seen by the user in a high dimensional format which is reduced to lower dimensions using tensor factorization techniques. The aspect of intent awareness (or scoring) is dealt with at this stage. Finally, combining the user activity data with the contextual information gives the recommendation score. The final recommendations are then ranked using filtering and collaborative recommendation techniques to show the top-k recommendations to the user. A provision for feedback is also envisioned in the current system which informs the model to update the various weights in the recommender system. Our overall model aims to combine both frequency-based and context-based recommendation systems and quantify the intent of a user to provide better recommendations. We ran experiments on real-world timestamped user activity data, in the setting of recommending reports to the users of a business analytics tool and the results are better than the baselines. We also tuned certain aspects of our model to arrive at optimized results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 5th International Workshop on Data Science and Big Data Analytics (DSBDA), 17th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2017; 8 pages; 4 figures; Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters," the abstract appearing here is slightly shorter than the one in the PDF file</p></details> |

These systems are then evaluated based on goals set by the aforementioned teams and other business units of the platforms operating the recommender systems. This design approach emphasizes the designers' vision for how the system can best serve the interests of users, providers, businesses, and other stakeholders. Although designers may be well-informed about user needs through user experience and market research, they are still the arbiters of the system's design and evaluation, with other stakeholders' interests less emphasized in user-centered design and evaluation. When extended to recommender systems for social good, this approach results in systems that reflect the social objectives as envisioned by the designers and evaluated as the designers understand them. Instead, social goals and operationalizations should be developed through participatory and democratic processes that are accountable to their stakeholders. We argue that recommender systems aimed at improving social good should be designed *by* and *with*, not just *for*, the people who will experience their benefits and harms. That is, they should be designed in collaboration with their users, creators, and other stakeholders as full co-designers, not only as user study participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM TORS Special Issue on Recommender Systems for Social Good</p></details> |

It begins with a synthetic overview of recommendation systems, followed by a presentation of the proprietary ARS algorithm, which is based on recommendation sessions. A mathematical model of the recommendation session, constructed using graph and network theory, serves as the input for the ARS algorithm. This paper also explores graph structure representation methods and the implementation of a G graph (representing a set of recommendation sessions) in a relational database using the SQL standard. The ARS algorithm was implemented in a working e-commerce information system, leading to the development of a fully functional recommendation system adaptable to various e-commerce IT systems. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by research on the recommendation system's parameters presented in the final section of the paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influential Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10002v2)** | 2022-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommender systems are typically passive in that they try to adapt their recommendations to the user's historical interests. However, it is highly desirable for commercial applications, such as e-commerce, advertisement placement, and news portals, to be able to expand the users' interests so that they would accept items that they were not originally aware of or interested in to increase customer interactions. In this paper, we present Influential Recommender System (IRS), a new recommendation paradigm that aims to proactively lead a user to like a given objective item by progressively recommending to the user a sequence of carefully selected items (called an influence path). We propose the Influential Recommender Network (IRN), which is a Transformer-based sequential model to encode the items' sequential dependencies. Since different people react to external influences differently, we introduce the Personalized Impressionability Mask (PIM) to model how receptive a user is to external influence to generate the most effective influence path for the user. To evaluate IRN, we design several performance metrics to measure whether or not the influence path can smoothly expand the user interest to include the objective item while maintaining the user's satisfaction with the recommendation. Experimental results show that IRN significantly outperforms the baseline recommenders and demonstrates its capability of influencing users' interests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2023 (The 39th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering)</p></details> |
| **[Welfare-Optimized Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13845v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a recommender system based on the Random Utility Model. Online shoppers are modeled as rational decision makers with limited information, and the recommendation task is formulated as the problem of optimally enriching the shopper's awareness set. Notably, the price information and the shopper's Willingness-To-Pay play crucial roles. Furthermore, to better account for the commercial nature of the recommendation, we unify the retailer and shoppers' contradictory objectives into a single welfare metric, which we propose as a new recommendation goal. We test our framework on synthetic data and show its performance in a wide range of scenarios. This new framework, that was absent from the Recommender System literature, opens the door to Welfare-Optimized Recommender Systems, couponing, and price optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Conversational Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00999v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have become increasingly popular as a powerful tool for providing personalized recommendation experiences. By directly engaging with users in a conversational manner to learn their current and fine-grained preferences, a CRS can quickly derive recommendations that are relevant and justifiable. However, existing conversational recommendation systems (CRSs) typically rely on a centralized training and deployment process, which involves collecting and storing explicitly-communicated user preferences in a centralized repository. These fine-grained user preferences are completely human-interpretable and can easily be used to infer sensitive information (e.g., financial status, political stands, and health information) about the user, if leaked or breached. To address the user privacy concerns in CRS, we first define a set of privacy protection guidelines for preserving user privacy under the conversational recommendation setting. Based on these guidelines, we propose a novel federated conversational recommendation framework that effectively reduces the risk of exposing user privacy by (i) de-centralizing both the historical interests estimation stage and the interactive preference elicitation stage and (ii) strictly bounding privacy leakage by enforcing user-level differential privacy with meticulously selected privacy budgets. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed framework not only satisfies these user privacy protection guidelines, but also enables the system to achieve competitive recommendation performance even when compared to the state-of-the-art non-private conversational recommendation approach.</p></details> | ECIR 2024 |
| **[Requirements Engineering for General Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05262v4)** | 2016-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In requirements engineering for recommender systems, software engineers must identify the data that drives the recommendations. This is a labor-intensive task, which is error-prone and expensive. One possible solution to this problem is the adoption of automatic recommender system development approach based on a general recommender framework. One step towards the creation of such a framework is to determine the type of data used in recommender systems. In this paper, a systematic review has been conducted to identify the type of user and recommendation data items needed by a general recommender system. A user and item model is proposed, and some considerations about algorithm specific parameters are explained. A further goal is to study the impact of the fields of big data and Internet of things on the development of recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

Recommendations such as news by Google, videos by Netflix, goods by e-commerce providers, etc. have heavily changed everyones lifestyle. Health domains contain similar decision-making problems such as what to eat, how to exercise, and what is the proper medicine for a patient. Recently, studies focused on recommender systems to solve health problems have attracted attention. In this paper, we review aspects of health recommender systems including interests, methods, evaluation, future challenges and trend issues. We find that 1) health recommender systems have their own health concern limitations that cause them to focus on less-risky recommendations such as diet recommendation; 2) traditional recommender methods such as content-based and collaborative filtering methods can hardly handle health constraints, but knowledge-based methods function more than ever; 3) evaluating a health recommendation is more complicated than evaluating a commercial one because multiple dimensions in addition to accuracy should be considered. Recommender systems can function well in the health domain after the solution of several key problems. Our work is a systematic review of health recommender system studies, we show current conditions and future directions. It is believed that this review will help domain researchers and promote health recommender systems to the next step.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 1 table, 1 figure, 38 discussed articles</p></details> |
| **[An Exploratory Study of Hierarchical Fuzzy Systems Approach in Recommendation System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14026v1)** | 2020-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation system or also known as a recommender system is a tool to help the user in providing a suggestion of a specific dilemma. Thus, recently, the interest in developing a recommendation system in many fields has increased. Fuzzy Logic system (FLSs) is one of the approaches that can be used to model the recommendation systems as it can deal with uncertainty and imprecise information. However, one of the fundamental issues in FLS is the problem of the curse of dimensionality. That is, the number of rules in FLSs is increasing exponentially with the number of input variables. One effective way to overcome this problem is by using Hierarchical Fuzzy System (HFSs). This paper aims to explore the use of HFSs for Recommendation system. Specifically, we are interested in exploring and comparing the HFS and FLS for the Career path recommendation system (CPRS) based on four key criteria, namely topology, the number of rules, the rules structures and interpretability. The findings suggested that the HFS has advantages over FLS towards improving the interpretability models, in the context of a recommendation system example. This study contributes to providing an insight into the development of interpretable HFSs in the Recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Contrastive Learning for Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01317v1)** | 2021-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems, which analyze users' preference patterns to suggest potential targets, are indispensable in today's society. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most popular recommendation model. Specifically, Graph Neural Network (GNN) has become a new state-of-the-art for CF. In the GNN-based recommender system, message dropout is usually used to alleviate the selection bias in the user-item bipartite graph. However, message dropout might deteriorate the recommender system's performance due to the randomness of dropping out the outgoing messages based on the user-item bipartite graph. To solve this problem, we propose a graph contrastive learning module for a general recommender system that learns the embeddings in a self-supervised manner and reduces the randomness of message dropout. Besides, many recommender systems optimize models with pairwise ranking objectives, such as the Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) based on a negative sampling strategy. However, BPR has the following problems: suboptimal sampling and sample bias. We introduce a new debiased contrastive loss to solve these problems, which provides sufficient negative samples and applies a bias correction probability to alleviate the sample bias. We integrate the proposed framework, including graph contrastive module and debiased contrastive module with several Matrix Factorization(MF) and GNN-based recommendation models. Experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1905.08108 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Poisoning Attacks to Graph-Based Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.04127v1)** | 2018-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender system is an important component of many web services to help users locate items that match their interests. Several studies showed that recommender systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, in which an attacker injects fake data to a given system such that the system makes recommendations as the attacker desires. However, these poisoning attacks are either agnostic to recommendation algorithms or optimized to recommender systems that are not graph-based. Like association-rule-based and matrix-factorization-based recommender systems, graph-based recommender system is also deployed in practice, e.g., eBay, Huawei App Store. However, how to design optimized poisoning attacks for graph-based recommender systems is still an open problem. In this work, we perform a systematic study on poisoning attacks to graph-based recommender systems. Due to limited resources and to avoid detection, we assume the number of fake users that can be injected into the system is bounded. The key challenge is how to assign rating scores to the fake users such that the target item is recommended to as many normal users as possible. To address the challenge, we formulate the poisoning attacks as an optimization problem, solving which determines the rating scores for the fake users. We also propose techniques to solve the optimization problem. We evaluate our attacks and compare them with existing attacks under white-box (recommendation algorithm and its parameters are known), gray-box (recommendation algorithm is known but its parameters are unknown), and black-box (recommendation algorithm is unknown) settings using two real-world datasets. Our results show that our attack is effective and outperforms existing attacks for graph-based recommender systems. For instance, when 1% fake users are injected, our attack can make a target item recommended to 580 times more normal users in certain scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>34th ...</summary><p>34th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC), 2018; Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract appearing here is slightly shorter than that in the PDF file</p></details> |

In this work, we argue for increased attention on the presence of and methods for counteracting bias in these emerging systems.

E-commerce companies such as Amazon, eBay, JD, Alibaba etc. are piloting such kind of agents with their users. However, the research on this topic is very limited and existing solutions are either based on single round adhoc search engine or traditional multi round dialog system. They usually only utilize user inputs in the current session, ignoring users' long term preferences. On the other hand, it is well known that sales conversion rate can be greatly improved based on recommender systems, which learn user preferences based on past purchasing behavior and optimize business oriented metrics such as conversion rate or expected revenue. In this work, we propose to integrate research in dialog systems and recommender systems into a novel and unified deep reinforcement learning framework to build a personalized conversational recommendation agent that optimizes a per session based utility function.</p></details> |  |

Although millions of users use recommender systems globally everyday, and indeed, much data analysis work has been done to improve the technical accuracy of the system, to our limited knowledge, there has been little attention paid to analysis of users' emotion in recommender systems. In this paper, we create a new theory and metrics that could capture users' emotion when they are interacting with recommender systems. We also provide effective and efficient visualization techniques for visualization of users' emotion and its change in the customers' lifetime cycle. In the end, we design a framework for emotion-based recommendation algorithms, illustrated in a straightforward example with experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our new theory.</p></details> |  |

Given the great generation capability exhibited by diffusion models in computer vision recently, many recommender systems have adopted diffusion models and found improvements in performance for various tasks. Research in this domain has been growing rapidly and calling for a systematic survey. In this survey paper, we present and propose a taxonomy in recommender systems that utilize diffusion models. Distinct from a prior survey paper that categorizes based on the role of the diffusion model, we categorize based on the recommendation task at hand. The decision originates from the rationale that after all, the adoption of diffusion models is to enhance the recommendation performance, not vice versa: adapting the recommendation task to enable diffusion models. Nonetheless, we offer a unique perspective for diffusion models in recommender systems complementary to existing surveys. We present the foundational algorithms in diffusion models and their applications in recommender systems to summarize the rapid development in this field. Finally, we discuss open research directions to prepare and encourage further efforts to advance the field. We compile the relevant papers in a public GitHub repository.</p></details> | 38 pages |

Several approaches exist in handling paper recommender systems. While most existing recommender systems rely either on a content-based approach or a collaborative approach, there are hybrid approaches that can improve recommendation accuracy using a combination of both approaches. Even though many algorithms are proposed using such methods, it is still necessary for further improvement. In this paper, we propose a recommender system method using a graph-based model associated with the similarity of users' ratings, in combination with users' demographic and location information. By utilizing the advantages of Autoencoder feature extraction, we extract new features based on all combined attributes. Using the new set of features for clustering users, our proposed approach (GHRS) has gained a significant improvement, which dominates other methods' performance in the cold-start problem. The experimental results on the MovieLens dataset show that the proposed algorithm outperforms many existing recommendation algorithms on recommendation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 13 figures, under review in an Elsevier journal</p></details> |

So far, much attention has been paid to designing new recommendation algorithms and improving existent ones. However, few works considered the different contributions from different users to the performance of a recommender system. Such studies can help us improve the recommendation efficiency by excluding irrelevant users. In this paper, we argue that in each online system there exists a group of core users who carry most of the information for recommendation. With them, the recommender systems can already generate satisfactory recommendation. Our core user extraction method enables the recommender systems to achieve 90% of the accuracy by taking only 20% of the data into account.</p></details> | 14pages, 5 figures |

In particular, Reinforcement Learning (RL) based recommender systems have become an emerging research topic in recent years, owing to the interactive nature and autonomous learning ability. Empirical results show that RL-based recommendation methods often surpass most of supervised learning methods. Nevertheless, there are various challenges of applying RL in recommender systems. To understand the challenges and relevant solutions, there should be a reference for researchers and practitioners working on RL-based recommender systems. To this end, we firstly provide a thorough overview, comparisons, and summarization of RL approaches applied in four typical recommendation scenarios, including interactive recommendation, conversational recommendatin, sequential recommendation, and explainable recommendation. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the challenges and relevant solutions on the basis of existing literature. Finally, under discussion for open issues of RL and its limitations of recommender systems, we highlight some potential research directions in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, Accepted by TNNLS 2023</p></details> |
| **[Economic Recommender Systems -- A Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11998v2)** | 2023-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many of today's online services provide personalized recommendations to their users. Such recommendations are typically designed to serve certain user needs, e.g., to quickly find relevant content in situations of information overload. Correspondingly, the academic literature in the field largely focuses on the value of recommender systems for the end user. In this context, one underlying assumption is that the improved service that is achieved through the recommendations will in turn positively impact the organization's goals, e.g., in the form of higher customer retention or loyalty. However, in reality, recommender systems can be used to target organizational economic goals more directly by incorporating monetary considerations such as price awareness and profitability aspects into the underlying recommendation models. In this work, we survey the existing literature on what we call Economic Recommender Systems based on a systematic review approach that helped us identify 133 relevant papers. We first categorize existing works along different dimensions and then review the most important technical approaches from the literature. Furthermore, we discuss common methodologies to evaluate such systems and finally outline the limitations of today's research and future directions.</p></details> |  |

However, the embedding tables are huge and account for most of the parameters in industrial-scale recommender systems. In order to reduce memory costs and improve efficiency, various approaches are proposed to compress the embedding tables. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of embedding compression approaches in recommender systems. We first introduce deep learning recommendation models and the basic concept of embedding compression in recommender systems. Subsequently, we systematically organize existing approaches into three categories, namely low-precision, mixed-dimension, and weight-sharing, respectively. Lastly, we summarize the survey with some general suggestions and provide future prospects for this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Computing Surveys</p></details> |
| **[Explainability in Music Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.10528v1)** | 2022-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The most common way to listen to recorded music nowadays is via streaming platforms which provide access to tens of millions of tracks. To assist users in effectively browsing these large catalogs, the integration of Music Recommender Systems (MRSs) has become essential. Current real-world MRSs are often quite complex and optimized for recommendation accuracy. They combine several building blocks based on collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation. This complexity can hinder the ability to explain recommendations to end users, which is particularly important for recommendations perceived as unexpected or inappropriate. While pure recommendation performance often correlates with user satisfaction, explainability has a positive impact on other factors such as trust and forgiveness, which are ultimately essential to maintain user loyalty. In this article, we discuss how explainability can be addressed in the context of MRSs. We provide perspectives on how explainability could improve music recommendation algorithms and enhance user experience. First, we review common dimensions and goals of recommenders' explainability and in general of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), and elaborate on the extent to which these apply -- or need to be adapted -- to the specific characteristics of music consumption and recommendation. Then, we show how explainability components can be integrated within a MRS and in what form explanations can be provided. Since the evaluation of explanation quality is decoupled from pure accuracy-based evaluation criteria, we also discuss requirements and strategies for evaluating explanations of music recommendations. Finally, we describe the current challenges for introducing explainability within a large-scale industrial music recommender system and provide research perspectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in AI Magazine, Special Topic on Recommender Systems 2022</p></details> |
| **[Effective Visualization and Analysis of Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01136v1)** | 2023-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender system exists everywhere in the business world. From Goodreads to TikTok, customers of internet products become more addicted to the products thanks to the technology. Industrial practitioners focus on increasing the technical accuracy of recommender systems while at same time balancing other factors such as diversity and serendipity. In spite of the length of the research and development history of recommender systems, there has been little discussion on how to take advantage of visualization techniques to facilitate the algorithmic design of the technology. In this paper, we use a series of data analysis and visualization techniques such as Takens Embedding, Determinantal Point Process and Social Network Analysis to help people develop effective recommender systems by predicting intermediate computational cost and output performance. Our work is pioneering in the field, as to our limited knowledge, there have been few publications (if any) on visualization of recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[User Fairness in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.06349v1)** | 2018-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works in recommendation systems have focused on diversity in recommendations as an important aspect of recommendation quality. In this work we argue that the post-processing algorithms aimed at only improving diversity among recommendations lead to discrimination among the users. We introduce the notion of user fairness which has been overlooked in literature so far and propose measures to quantify it. Our experiments on two diversification algorithms show that an increase in aggregate diversity results in increased disparity among the users.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Trustworthy Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10117v1)** | 2022-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the most successful AI-powered applications, recommender systems aim to help people make appropriate decisions in an effective and efficient way, by providing personalized suggestions in many aspects of our lives, especially for various human-oriented online services such as e-commerce platforms and social media sites. In the past few decades, the rapid developments of recommender systems have significantly benefited human by creating economic value, saving time and effort, and promoting social good. However, recent studies have found that data-driven recommender systems can pose serious threats to users and society, such as spreading fake news to manipulate public opinion in social media sites, amplifying unfairness toward under-represented groups or individuals in job matching services, or inferring privacy information from recommendation results. Therefore, systems' trustworthiness has been attracting increasing attention from various aspects for mitigating negative impacts caused by recommender systems, so as to enhance the public's trust towards recommender systems techniques. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of Trustworthy Recommender systems (TRec) with a specific focus on six of the most important aspects; namely, Safety & Robustness, Nondiscrimination & Fairness, Explainability, Privacy, Environmental Well-being, and Accountability & Auditability. For each aspect, we summarize the recent related technologies and discuss potential research directions to help achieve trustworthy recommender systems in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[RecRec: Algorithmic Recourse for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14916v1)** | 2023-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems play an essential role in the choices people make in domains such as entertainment, shopping, food, news, employment, and education. The machine learning models underlying these recommender systems are often enormously large and black-box in nature for users, content providers, and system developers alike. It is often crucial for all stakeholders to understand the model's rationale behind making certain predictions and recommendations. This is especially true for the content providers whose livelihoods depend on the recommender system. Drawing motivation from the practitioners' need, in this work, we propose a recourse framework for recommender systems, targeted towards the content providers. Algorithmic recourse in the recommendation setting is a set of actions that, if executed, would modify the recommendations (or ranking) of an item in the desired manner. A recourse suggests actions of the form: "if a feature changes X to Y, then the ranking of that item for a set of users will change to Z." Furthermore, we demonstrate that RecRec is highly effective in generating valid, sparse, and actionable recourses through an empirical evaluation of recommender systems trained on three real-world datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to conceptualize and empirically test a generalized framework for generating recourses for recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a short paper at CIKM 2023</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on LLM-based News Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09797v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>News recommender systems play a critical role in mitigating the information overload problem. In recent years, due to the successful applications of large language model technologies, researchers have utilized Discriminative Large Language Models (DLLMs) or Generative Large Language Models (GLLMs) to improve the performance of news recommender systems. Although several recent surveys review significant challenges for deep learning-based news recommender systems, such as fairness, privacy-preserving, and responsibility, there is a lack of a systematic survey on Large Language Model (LLM)-based news recommender systems. In order to review different core methodologies and explore potential issues systematically, we categorize DLLM-based and GLLM-based news recommender systems under the umbrella of LLM-based news recommender systems. In this survey, we first overview the development of deep learning-based news recommender systems. Then, we review LLM-based news recommender systems based on three aspects: news-oriented modeling, user-oriented modeling, and prediction-oriented modeling. Next, we examine the challenges from various perspectives, including datasets, benchmarking tools, and methodologies. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze how large language model technologies affect the performance of different news recommender systems. Finally, we comprehensively explore the future directions for LLM-based news recommendations in the era of LLMs.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Limits to Surprise in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03905v1)** | 2018-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we address the challenge of measuring the ability of a recommender system to make surprising recommendations. Although current evaluation methods make it possible to determine if two algorithms can make recommendations with a significant difference in their average surprise measure, it could be of interest to our community to know how competent an algorithm is at embedding surprise in its recommendations, without having to resort to making a direct comparison with another algorithm. We argue that a) surprise is a finite resource in a recommender system, b) there is a limit to how much surprise any algorithm can embed in a recommendation, and c) this limit can provide us with a scale against which the performance of any algorithm can be measured. By exploring these ideas, it is possible to define the concepts of maximum and minimum potential surprise and design a surprise metric called "normalised surprise" that employs these limits to potential surprise. Two experiments were conducted to test the proposed metric. The aim of the first was to validate the quality of the estimates of minimum and maximum potential surprise produced by a greedy algorithm. The purpose of the second experiment was to analyse the behaviour of the proposed metric using the MovieLens dataset. The results confirmed the behaviour that was expected, and showed that the proposed surprise metric is both effective and consistent for differing choices of recommendation algorithms, data representations and distance functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, conference format</p></details> |
| **[Looking for Fairness in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12242v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems can be found everywhere today, shaping our everyday experience whenever we're consuming content, ordering food, buying groceries online, or even just reading the news. Let's imagine we're in the process of building a recommender system to make content suggestions to users on social media. When thinking about fairness, it becomes clear there are several perspectives to consider: the users asking for tailored suggestions, the content creators hoping for some limelight, and society at large, navigating the repercussions of algorithmic recommendations. A shared fairness concern across all three is the emergence of filter bubbles, a side-effect that takes place when recommender systems are almost "too good", making recommendations so tailored that users become inadvertently confined to a narrow set of opinions/themes and isolated from alternative ideas. From the user's perspective, this is akin to manipulation. From the small content creator's perspective, this is an obstacle preventing them access to a whole range of potential fans. From society's perspective, the potential consequences are far-reaching, influencing collective opinions, social behavior and political decisions. How can our recommender system be fine-tuned to avoid the creation of filter bubbles, and ensure a more inclusive and diverse content landscape? Approaching this problem involves defining one (or more) performance metric to represent diversity, and tweaking our recommender system's performance through the lens of fairness. By incorporating this metric into our evaluation framework, we aim to strike a balance between personalized recommendations and the broader societal goal of fostering rich and varied cultures and points of view.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do recommender systems benefit users?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.04921v1)** | 2017-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are present in many web applications to guide our choices. They increase sales and benefit sellers, but whether they benefit customers by providing relevant products is questionable. Here we introduce a model to examine the benefit of recommender systems for users, and found that recommendations from the system can be equivalent to random draws if one relies too strongly on the system. Nevertheless, with sufficient information about user preferences, recommendations become accurate and an abrupt transition to this accurate regime is observed for some algorithms. On the other hand, we found that a high accuracy evaluated by common accuracy metrics does not necessarily correspond to a high real accuracy nor a benefit for users, which serves as an alarm for operators and researchers of recommender systems. We tested our model with a real dataset and observed similar behaviors. Finally, a recommendation approach with improved accuracy is suggested. These results imply that recommender systems can benefit users, but relying too strongly on the system may render the system ineffective.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Forgetting Fast in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06875v1)** | 2022-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Users of a recommender system may want part of their data being deleted, not only from the data repository but also from the underlying machine learning model, for privacy or utility reasons. Such right-to-be-forgotten requests could be fulfilled by simply retraining the recommendation model from scratch, but that would be too slow and too expensive in practice. In this paper, we investigate fast machine unlearning techniques for recommender systems that can remove the effect of a small amount of training data from the recommendation model without incurring the full cost of retraining. A natural idea to speed this process up is to fine-tune the current recommendation model on the remaining training data instead of starting from a random initialization. This warm-start strategy indeed works for neural recommendation models using standard 1st-order neural network optimizers (like AdamW). However, we have found that even greater acceleration could be achieved by employing 2nd-order (Newton or quasi-Newton) optimization methods instead. To overcome the prohibitively high computational cost of 2nd-order optimizers, we propose a new recommendation unlearning approach AltEraser which divides the optimization problem of unlearning into many small tractable sub-problems. Extensive experiments on three real-world recommendation datasets show promising results of AltEraser in terms of consistency (forgetting thoroughness), accuracy (recommendation effectiveness), and efficiency (unlearning speed). To our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt at fast approximate machine unlearning for state-of-the-art neural recommendation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Generalizability and Predictability of Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.11886v2)** | 2022-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While other areas of machine learning have seen more and more automation, designing a high-performing recommender system still requires a high level of human effort. Furthermore, recent work has shown that modern recommender system algorithms do not always improve over well-tuned baselines. A natural follow-up question is, "how do we choose the right algorithm for a new dataset and performance metric?" In this work, we start by giving the first large-scale study of recommender system approaches by comparing 18 algorithms and 100 sets of hyperparameters across 85 datasets and 315 metrics. We find that the best algorithms and hyperparameters are highly dependent on the dataset and performance metric, however, there are also strong correlations between the performance of each algorithm and various meta-features of the datasets. Motivated by these findings, we create RecZilla, a meta-learning approach to recommender systems that uses a model to predict the best algorithm and hyperparameters for new, unseen datasets. By using far more meta-training data than prior work, RecZilla is able to substantially reduce the level of human involvement when faced with a new recommender system application. We not only release our code and pretrained RecZilla models, but also all of our raw experimental results, so that practitioners can train a RecZilla model for their desired performance metric: https://github.com/naszilla/reczilla.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2022 |

The dialog system can enhance the performance of the recommendation system by introducing knowledge-grounded information about users' preferences, and the recommender system can improve that of the dialog generation system by providing recommendation-aware vocabulary bias. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model has significant advantages over the baselines in both the evaluation of dialog generation and recommendation. A series of analyses show that the two systems can bring mutual benefits to each other, and the introduced knowledge contributes to both their performances.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in EMNLP 2019</p></details> |

Within the realm of recommender systems, technical debt encompasses the trade-offs and expedient choices made during the development and upkeep of the recommendation system, which could potentially have adverse effects on its long-term performance, scalability, and maintainability. In this vision paper, our objective is to kickstart a research direction regarding Technical Debt in Recommender Systems. We identified 15 potential factors, along with detailed explanations outlining why it is advisable to consider them.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Connection-Centric Survey of Recommender Systems Research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0205059v2)** | 2005-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems attempt to reduce information overload and retain customers by selecting a subset of items from a universal set based on user preferences. While research in recommender systems grew out of information retrieval and filtering, the topic has steadily advanced into a legitimate and challenging research area of its own. Recommender systems have traditionally been studied from a content-based filtering vs. collaborative design perspective. Recommendations, however, are not delivered within a vacuum, but rather cast within an informal community of users and social context. Therefore, ultimately all recommender systems make connections among people and thus should be surveyed from such a perspective. This viewpoint is under-emphasized in the recommender systems literature. We therefore take a connection-oriented viewpoint toward recommender systems research. We posit that recommendation has an inherently social element and is ultimately intended to connect people either directly as a result of explicit user modeling or indirectly through the discovery of relationships implicit in extant data. Thus, recommender systems are characterized by how they model users to bring people together: explicitly or implicitly. Finally, user modeling and the connection-centric viewpoint raise broadening and social issues--such as evaluation, targeting, and privacy and trust--which we also briefly address.</p></details> | <details><summary>Based...</summary><p>Based on the comments from reviewers, we have made modifications to our article, including the following: Shifted the focus of the survey completely to recommender system research rather than recommendation and personalization and subsequently changed the title to "A Connection-Centric Survey of Recommender Systems Research."

How much of a user's experience over time with a recommender is caused by the recommender system's choices and biases, and how much is based on the user's preferences and biases? Popularity bias and filter bubbles are two of the most well-studied recommender system biases, but most of the prior research has focused on understanding the system behavior in a single recommendation step. How do these biases interplay with user behavior, and what types of user experiences are created from repeated interactions? In this work, we offer a simulation framework for measuring the impact of a recommender system under different types of user behavior. Using this simulation framework, we can (a) isolate the effect of the recommender system from the user preferences, and (b) examine how the system performs not just on average for an "average user" but also the extreme experiences under atypical user behavior. As part of the simulation framework, we propose a set of evaluation metrics over the simulations to understand the recommender system's behavior. Finally, we present two empirical case studies -- one on traditional collaborative filtering in MovieLens and one on a large-scale production recommender system -- to understand how popularity bias manifests over time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Second Workshop on Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Ethics and Society on the Web (FATES 2020) with the title "Beyond Next Step Bias: Trajectory Simulation for Understanding Recommender System Behavior"</p></details> |
| **[Deconvolving Feedback Loops in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01049v1)** | 2017-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative filtering is a popular technique to infer users' preferences on new content based on the collective information of all users preferences. Recommender systems then use this information to make personalized suggestions to users. When users accept these recommendations it creates a feedback loop in the recommender system, and these loops iteratively influence the collaborative filtering algorithm's predictions over time. We investigate whether it is possible to identify items affected by these feedback loops. We state sufficient assumptions to deconvolve the feedback loops while keeping the inverse solution tractable. We furthermore develop a metric to unravel the recommender system's influence on the entire user-item rating matrix. We use this metric on synthetic and real-world datasets to (1) identify the extent to which the recommender system affects the final rating matrix, (2) rank frequently recommended items, and (3) distinguish whether a user's rated item was recommended or an intrinsic preference. Our results indicate that it is possible to recover the ratings matrix of intrinsic user preferences using a single snapshot of the ratings matrix without any temporal information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neura...</summary><p>Neural Information Processing Systems, 2016</p></details> |

From recommending books in Amazon to finding friends in social networks such as Facebook, they have become omnipresent. Generally, recommender systems can be classified into two main categories: content based and collaborative filtering based models. Both these models build relationships between users and items to provide recommendations. Content based systems achieve this task by utilizing features extracted from the context available, whereas collaborative systems use shared interests between user-item subsets. There is another relatively unexplored approach for providing recommendations that utilizes a stochastic process named random walks.

Therefore, regulations and requirements for trustworthy artificial intelligence, for example, the European AI Act, which includes notions such as transparency, privacy, and fairness are also highly relevant for the design of recommender systems in practice. This habilitation elaborates on aspects related to these three notions in the light of recommender systems, namely: (i) transparency and cognitive models, (ii) privacy and limited preference information, and (iii) fairness and popularity bias in recommender systems. Specifically, with respect to aspect (i), we highlight the usefulness of incorporating psychological theories for a transparent design process of recommender systems. We term this type of systems psychology-informed recommender systems. In aspect (ii), we study and address the trade-off between accuracy and privacy in differentially-private recommendations. We design a novel recommendation approach for collaborative filtering based on an efficient neighborhood reuse concept, which reduces the number of users that need to be protected with differential privacy. Furthermore, we address the related issue of limited availability of user preference information, e.g., click data, in the settings of session-based and cold-start recommendations. With respect to aspect (iii), we analyze popularity bias in recommender systems. We find that the recommendation frequency of an item is positively correlated with this item's popularity. This also leads to the unfair treatment of users with little interest in popular content. Finally, we study long-term fairness dynamics in algorithmic decision support in the labor market using agent-based modeling techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Habil...</summary><p>Habilitation (post-doctoral thesis) at Graz University of Technology for the scientific subject "Applied Computer Science" (accepted in June 2024)</p></details> |

Due to the important application value of recommender systems, there have always been emerging works in this field. In recommender systems, the main challenge is to learn the effective user/item representations from their interactions and side information (if any). Recently, graph neural network (GNN) techniques have been widely utilized in recommender systems since most of the information in recommender systems essentially has graph structure and GNN has superiority in graph representation learning. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on GNN-based recommender systems. Specifically, we provide a taxonomy of GNN-based recommendation models according to the types of information used and recommendation tasks.

In particular, we focus on evaluating the reachability and navigability of recommendation networks and investigate the following questions: (i) How well do recommendation networks support navigation and exploratory search? (ii) What is the influence of parameters, in particular different recommendation algorithms and the number of recommendations shown, on reachability and navigability? and (iii) How can reachability and navigability be improved in these networks? We tackle these questions by first evaluating the reachability of recommendation networks by investigating their structural properties. Second, we evaluate navigability by simulating three different models of information seeking scenarios. We find that with standard algorithms, recommender systems are not well suited to navigation and exploration and propose methods to modify recommendations to improve this. Our work extends from one-click-based evaluations of recommender systems towards multi-click analysis (i.e., sequences of dependent clicks) and presents a general, comprehensive approach to evaluating navigability of arbitrary recommendation networks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Watermarking Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21034v3)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems embody significant commercial value and represent crucial intellectual property. However, the integrity of these systems is constantly challenged by malicious actors seeking to steal their underlying models. Safeguarding against such threats is paramount to upholding the rights and interests of the model owner. While model watermarking has emerged as a potent defense mechanism in various domains, its direct application to recommender systems remains unexplored and non-trivial. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing Autoregressive Out-of-distribution Watermarking (AOW), a novel technique tailored specifically for recommender systems. Our approach entails selecting an initial item and querying it through the oracle model, followed by the selection of subsequent items with small prediction scores. This iterative process generates a watermark sequence autoregressively, which is then ingrained into the model's memory through training. To assess the efficacy of the watermark, the model is tasked with predicting the subsequent item given a truncated watermark sequence. Through extensive experimentation and analysis, we demonstrate the superior performance and robust properties of AOW. Notably, our watermarking technique exhibits high-confidence extraction capabilities and maintains effectiveness even in the face of distillation and fine-tuning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Principled User-side Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.09864v1)** | 2022-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, recommendation algorithms have been designed for service developers. However, recently, a new paradigm called user-side recommender systems has been proposed and they enable web service users to construct their own recommender systems without access to trade-secret data. This approach opens the door to user-defined fair systems even if the official recommender system of the service is not fair. While existing methods for user-side recommender systems have addressed the challenging problem of building recommender systems without using log data, they rely on heuristic approaches, and it is still unclear whether constructing user-side recommender systems is a well-defined problem from theoretical point of view. In this paper, we provide theoretical justification of user-side recommender systems. Specifically, we see that hidden item features can be recovered from the information available to the user, making the construction of user-side recommender system well-defined. However, this theoretically grounded approach is not efficient. To realize practical yet theoretically sound recommender systems, we propose three desirable properties of user-side recommender systems and propose an effective and efficient user-side recommender system, \textsc{Consul}, based on these foundations. We prove that \textsc{Consul} satisfies all three properties, whereas existing user-side recommender systems lack at least one of them. In the experiments, we empirically validate the theory of feature recovery via numerical experiments. We also show that our proposed method achieves an excellent trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency and demonstrate via case studies that the proposed method can retrieve information that the provider's official recommender system cannot.</p></details> | CIKM 2022 |

Since 2013, Huawei Noah's Ark Lab has helped many products build recommender systems and search engines for getting the right information to the right users. Every day, our recommender systems serve hundreds of millions of mobile phone users and recommend different kinds of content and services such as apps, news feeds, songs, videos, books, themes, and instant services. The big data and various scenarios provide us with great opportunities to develop advanced recommendation technologies. Furthermore, we have witnessed the technical trend of recommendation models in the past ten years, from the shallow and simple models like collaborative filtering, linear models, low rank models to deep and complex models like neural networks, pre-trained language models. Based on the mission, opportunities and technological trends, we have also met several hard problems in our recommender systems. In this talk, we will share ten important and interesting challenges and hope that the RecSys community can get inspired and create better recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliability quality measures for recommender systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04457v1)** | 2024-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Users want to know the reliability of the recommendations; they do not accept high predictions if there is no reliability evidence. Recommender systems should provide reliability values associated with the predictions. Research into reliability measures requires the existence of simple, plausible and universal reliability quality measures. Research into recommender system quality measures has focused on accuracy. Moreover, novelty, serendipity and diversity have been studied; nevertheless there is an important lack of research into reliability/confidence quality measures. This paper proposes a reliability quality prediction measure (RPI) and a reliability quality recommendation measure (RRI). Both quality measures are based on the hypothesis that the more suitable a reliability measure is, the better accuracy results it will provide when applied. These reliability quality measures show accuracy improvements when appropriated reliability values are associated with their predictions (i.e. high reliability values associated with correct predictions or low reliability values associated with incorrect predictions). The proposed reliability quality metrics will lead to the design of brand new recommender system reliability measures. These measures could be applied to different matrix factorization techniques and to content-based, context-aware and social recommendation approaches. The recommender system reliability measures designed could be tested, compared and improved using the proposed reliability quality metrics.</p></details> |  |

In this work we study the question of how a vendor can directly incorporate the profitability of items into its recommender so as to maximize its expected profit while still providing accurate recommendations. Our approach uses the output of any traditional recommender system and adjust them according to item profitabilities. Our approach is parameterized so the vendor can control how much the recommendation incorporating profits can deviate from the traditional recommendation. We study our approach under two settings and show that it achieves approximately 22% more profit than traditional recommendations.</p></details> |  |

Recommender systems have become a technology that has been widely used by various online applications in situations where there is an information overload problem. Numerous applications such as e-Commerce, video platforms and social networks provide personalized recommendations to their users and this has improved the user experience and vendor revenues. The development of recommender systems has been focused mostly on the proposal of new algorithms that provide more accurate recommendations. However, the use of mobile devices and the rapid growth of the internet and networking infrastructure has brought the necessity of using mobile recommender systems. The links between web and mobile recommender systems are described along with how the recommendations in mobile environments can be improved. This work is focused on identifying the links between web and mobile recommender systems and to provide solid future directions that aim to lead in a more integrated mobile recommendation domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Selection for Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07403v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the construction of a multi-selection model to answer differentially private queries in the context of recommendation systems. The server sends back multiple recommendations and a ``local model'' to the user, which the user can run locally on its device to select the item that best fits its private features. We study a setup where the server uses a deep neural network (trained on the Movielens 25M dataset as the ground truth for movie recommendation. In the multi-selection paradigm, the average recommendation utility is approximately 97\% of the optimal utility (as determined by the ground truth neural network) while maintaining a local differential privacy guarantee with $ε$ ranging around 1 with respect to feature vectors of neighboring users. This is in comparison to an average recommendation utility of 91\% in the non-multi-selection regime under the same constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Popularity Bias in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01118v3)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems help people find relevant content in a personalized way. One main promise of such systems is that they are able to increase the visibility of items in the long tail, i.e., the lesser-known items in a catalogue. Existing research, however, suggests that in many situations todays recommendation algorithms instead exhibit a popularity bias, meaning that they often focus on rather popular items in their recommendations. Such a bias may not only lead to the limited value of the recommendations for consumers and providers in the short run, but it may also cause undesired reinforcement effects over time. In this paper, we discuss the potential reasons for popularity bias and review existing approaches to detect, quantify and mitigate popularity bias in recommender systems. Our survey, therefore, includes both an overview of the computational metrics used in the literature as well as a review of the main technical approaches to reduce the bias. Furthermore, we critically discuss todays literature, where we observe that the research is almost entirely based on computational experiments and on certain assumptions regarding the practical effects of including long-tail items in the recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diversification in Session-based News Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03265v2)** | 2021-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are widely applied in digital platforms such as news websites to personalize services based on user preferences. In news websites most of users are anonymous and the only available data is sequences of items in anonymous sessions. Due to this, typical collaborative filtering methods, which are highly applied in many applications, are not effective in news recommendations. In this context, session-based recommenders are able to recommend next items given the sequence of previous items in the active session. Neighborhood-based session-based recommenders has been shown to be highly effective compared to more sophisticated approaches. In this study we propose scenarios to make these session-based recommender systems diversity-aware and to address the filter bubble phenomenon. The filter bubble phenomenon is a common concern in news recommendation systems and it occurs when the system narrows the information and deprives users of diverse information. The results of applying the proposed scenarios show that these diversification scenarios improve the diversity measures in these session-based recommender systems based on four news datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pers ...</summary><p>Pers Ubiquit Comput (2021)</p></details> |
| **[Measuring Commonality in Recommendation of Cultural Content: Recommender Systems to Enhance Cultural Citizenship](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01696v1)** | 2022-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have become the dominant means of curating cultural content, significantly influencing the nature of individual cultural experience. While the majority of research on recommender systems optimizes for personalized user experience, this paradigm does not capture the ways that recommender systems impact cultural experience in the aggregate, across populations of users. Although existing novelty, diversity, and fairness studies probe how systems relate to the broader social role of cultural content, they do not adequately center culture as a core concept and challenge. In this work, we introduce commonality as a new measure that reflects the degree to which recommendations familiarize a given user population with specified categories of cultural content. Our proposed commonality metric responds to a set of arguments developed through an interdisciplinary dialogue between researchers in computer science and the social sciences and humanities. With reference to principles underpinning non-profit, public service media systems in democratic societies, we identify universality of address and content diversity in the service of strengthening cultural citizenship as particularly relevant goals for recommender systems delivering cultural content. Taking diversity in movie recommendation as a case study in enhancing pluralistic cultural experience, we empirically compare systems' performance using commonality and existing utility, diversity, and fairness metrics. Our results demonstrate that commonality captures a property of system behavior complementary to existing metrics and suggest the need for alternative, non-personalized interventions in recommender systems oriented to strengthening cultural citizenship across populations of users. In this way, commonality contributes to a growing body of scholarship developing 'public good' rationales for digital media and ML systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 16th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Behavior Recommender Systems: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06963v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommender systems primarily rely on a single type of user-item interaction, such as item purchases or ratings, to predict user preferences. However, in real-world scenarios, users engage in a variety of behaviors, such as clicking on items or adding them to carts, offering richer insights into their interests. Multi-behavior recommender systems leverage these diverse interactions to enhance recommendation quality, and research on this topic has grown rapidly in recent years. This survey provides a timely review of multi-behavior recommender systems, focusing on three key steps: (1) Data Modeling: representing multi-behaviors at the input level, (2) Encoding: transforming these inputs into vector representations (i.e., embeddings), and (3) Training: optimizing machine-learning models. We systematically categorize existing multi-behavior recommender systems based on the commonalities and differences in their approaches across the above steps. Additionally, we discuss promising future directions for advancing multi-behavior recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the PAKDD 2025 Survey Track</p></details> |

Although some online services have adopted fairness aware systems recently, many other services have not adopted them yet. In this work, we propose methods to enable the users to build their own fair recommender systems. Our methods can generate fair recommendations even when the service does not (or cannot) provide fair recommender systems. The key challenge is that a user does not have access to the log data of other users or the latent representations of items. This restriction prohibits us from adopting existing methods designed for service providers. The main idea is that a user has access to unfair recommendations shown by the service provider. Our methods leverage the outputs of an unfair recommender system to construct a new fair recommender system. We empirically validate that our proposed method improves fairness substantially without harming much performance of the original unfair system.</p></details> | SDM 2022 |
| **[A Personalized System for Conversational Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.0029v1)** | 2011-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Searching for and making decisions about information is becoming increasingly difficult as the amount of information and number of choices increases. Recommendation systems help users find items of interest of a particular type, such as movies or restaurants, but are still somewhat awkward to use. Our solution is to take advantage of the complementary strengths of personalized recommendation systems and dialogue systems, creating personalized aides. We present a system -- the Adaptive Place Advisor -- that treats item selection as an interactive, conversational process, with the program inquiring about item attributes and the user responding. Individual, long-term user preferences are unobtrusively obtained in the course of normal recommendation dialogues and used to direct future conversations with the same user. We present a novel user model that influences both item search and the questions asked during a conversation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in significantly reducing the time and number of interactions required to find a satisfactory item, as compared to a control group of users interacting with a non-adaptive version of the system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing the long-term performance of recommender system](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00672v1)** | 2019-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender system is a critically important tool in online commercial system and provide users with personalized recommendation on items. So far, numerous recommendation algorithms have been made to further improve the recommendation performance in a single-step recommendation, while the long-term recommendation performance is neglected. In this paper, we proposed an approach called Adjustment of Recommendation List (ARL) to enhance the long-term recommendation accuracy. In order to observe the long-term accuracy, we developed an evolution model of network to simulate the interaction between the recommender system and user's behaviour. The result shows that not only long-term recommendation accuracy can be enhanced significantly but the diversity of item in online system maintains healthy. Notably, an optimal parameter n* of ARL existed in long-term recommendation, indicating that there is a trade-off between keeping diversity of item and user's preference to maximize the long-term recommendation accuracy. Finally, we confirmed that the optimal parameter n* is stable during evolving network, which reveals the robustness of ARL method.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

Current data visualization recommender systems exist to aid in choosing a visualization, yet suffer from issues such as low accessibility and indecisiveness. In this study, we first define a step-by-step guide on how to build a data visualization recommender system. We then use this guide to create a model for a data visualization recommender system for non-experts that aims to resolve the issues of current solutions. The result is a question-based model that uses a decision tree and a data visualization classification hierarchy in order to recommend a visualization. Furthermore, it incorporates both task-driven and data characteristics-driven perspectives, whereas existing solutions seem to either convolute these or focus on one of the two exclusively. Based on testing against existing solutions, it is shown that the new model reaches similar results while being simpler, clearer, more versatile, extendable and transparent. The presented guide can be used as a manual for anyone building a data visualization recommender system. The resulting model can be applied in the development of new data visualization software or as part of a learning tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper, DATA 2018, part of the Communications in Computer and Information Science book series</p></details> |

In this sense, recommender systems may be deleterious to notions of human autonomy. Many ethical systems point to respect for human autonomy as a key principle arising from human rights considerations, and several emerging frameworks for AI include this principle. Yet, no specific formalization has been defined. Separately, self-determination theory shows that autonomy is an innate psychological need for people, and moreover has a significant body of experimental work that formalizes and measures level of human autonomy. In this position paper, we argue that there is a need to specifically operationalize respect for human autonomy in the context of recommender systems. Moreover, that such an operational definition can be developed based on well-established approaches from experimental psychology, which can then be used to design future recommender systems that respect human autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 page position paper presented at 3rd FAccTRec Workshop on Responsible Recommendation (RecSys 2020 Workshop)</p></details> |

However, the existing recommender systems overlook the unique challenges inherent in the music domain, specifically shuffle play, which provides subsequent tracks in a random sequence. Based on our observation that the shuffle play sessions hinder the overall training process of music recommender systems mainly due to the high unique transition rates of shuffle play sessions, we propose a Music Recommender System with Shuffle Play Recommendation Enhancement (MUSE). MUSE employs the self-supervised learning framework that maximizes the agreement between the original session and the augmented session, which is augmented by our novel session augmentation method, called transition-based augmentation. To further facilitate the alignment of the representations between the two views, we devise two fine-grained matching strategies, i.e., item- and similarity-based matching strategies. Through rigorous experiments conducted across diverse environments, we demonstrate MUSE's efficacy over 12 baseline models on a large-scale Music Streaming Sessions Dataset (MSSD) from Spotify.

| **[Recency Dropout for Recurrent Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11016v1)** | 2022-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent recommender systems have been successful in capturing the temporal dynamics in users' activity trajectories. However, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are known to have difficulty learning long-term dependencies. As a consequence, RNN-based recommender systems tend to overly focus on short-term user interests. This is referred to as the recency bias, which could negatively affect the long-term user experience as well as the health of the ecosystem. In this paper, we introduce the recency dropout technique, a simple yet effective data augmentation technique to alleviate the recency bias in recurrent recommender systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of recency dropout in various experimental settings including a simulation study, offline experiments, as well as live experiments on a large-scale industrial recommendation platform.</p></details> |  |

Similarly, the predictive accuracy of learning machines heavily depends on the feedback data that we provide them. This mutual influence can lead to closed-loop interactions that may cause unknown biases which can be exacerbated after several iterations of machine learning predictions and user feedback. Machine-caused biases risk leading to undesirable social effects ranging from polarization to unfairness and filter bubbles. In this paper, we study the bias inherent in widely used recommendation strategies such as matrix factorization. Then we model the exposure that is borne from the interaction between the user and the recommender system and propose new debiasing strategies for these systems. Finally, we try to mitigate the recommendation system bias by engineering solutions for several state of the art recommender system models. Our results show that recommender systems are biased and depend on the prior exposure of the user. We also show that the studied bias iteratively decreases diversity in the output recommendations. Our debiasing method demonstrates the need for alternative recommendation strategies that take into account the exposure process in order to reduce bias. Our research findings show the importance of understanding the nature of and dealing with bias in machine learning models such as recommender systems that interact directly with humans, and are thus causing an increasing influence on human discovery and decision making</p></details> | <details><summary>9 fig...</summary><p>9 figures and one table.

Existing recommender systems extract user preferences based on the correlation in data, such as behavioral correlation in collaborative filtering, feature-feature, or feature-behavior correlation in click-through rate prediction. However, unfortunately, the real world is driven by causality, not just correlation, and correlation does not imply causation. For instance, recommender systems might recommend a battery charger to a user after buying a phone, where the latter can serve as the cause of the former; such a causal relation cannot be reversed. Recently, to address this, researchers in recommender systems have begun utilizing causal inference to extract causality, thereby enhancing the recommender system. In this survey, we offer a comprehensive review of the literature on causal inference-based recommendation. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts of both recommender system and causal inference as the foundation for subsequent content. We then highlight the typical issues faced by non-causality recommender system. Following that, we thoroughly review the existing work on causal inference-based recommender systems, based on a taxonomy of three-aspect challenges that causal inference can address. Finally, we discuss the open problems in this critical research area and suggest important potential future works.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS)</p></details> |

| **[Representation Learning: A Statistical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11374v1)** | 2019-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning representations of data is an important problem in statistics and machine learning. While the origin of learning representations can be traced back to factor analysis and multidimensional scaling in statistics, it has become a central theme in deep learning with important applications in computer vision and computational neuroscience. In this article, we review recent advances in learning representations from a statistical perspective. In particular, we review the following two themes: (a) unsupervised learning of vector representations and (b) learning of both vector and matrix representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning sparse representations in reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01575v1)** | 2019-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms allow artificial agents to improve their selection of actions to increase rewarding experiences in their environments. Temporal Difference (TD) Learning -- a model-free RL method -- is a leading account of the midbrain dopamine system and the basal ganglia in reinforcement learning. These algorithms typically learn a mapping from the agent's current sensed state to a selected action (known as a policy function) via learning a value function (expected future rewards). TD Learning methods have been very successful on a broad range of control tasks, but learning can become intractably slow as the state space of the environment grows. This has motivated methods that learn internal representations of the agent's state, effectively reducing the size of the state space and restructuring state representations in order to support generalization. However, TD Learning coupled with an artificial neural network, as a function approximator, has been shown to fail to learn some fairly simple control tasks, challenging this explanation of reward-based learning. We hypothesize that such failures do not arise in the brain because of the ubiquitous presence of lateral inhibition in the cortex, producing sparse distributed internal representations that support the learning of expected future reward. The sparse conjunctive representations can avoid catastrophic interference while still supporting generalization. We provide support for this conjecture through computational simulations, demonstrating the benefits of learned sparse representations for three problematic classic control tasks: Puddle-world, Mountain-car, and Acrobot.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Representations Align: Universality in Representation Learning Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09142v2)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks come in many sizes and architectures. The choice of architecture, in conjunction with the dataset and learning algorithm, is commonly understood to affect the learned neural representations. Yet, recent results have shown that different architectures learn representations with striking qualitative similarities. Here we derive an effective theory of representation learning under the assumption that the encoding map from input to hidden representation and the decoding map from representation to output are arbitrary smooth functions. This theory schematizes representation learning dynamics in the regime of complex, large architectures, where hidden representations are not strongly constrained by the parametrization. We show through experiments that the effective theory describes aspects of representation learning dynamics across a range of deep networks with different activation functions and architectures, and exhibits phenomena similar to the "rich" and "lazy" regime. While many network behaviors depend quantitatively on architecture, our findings point to certain behaviors that are widely conserved once models are sufficiently flexible.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Provable benefits of representation learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04601v1)** | 2017-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is general consensus that learning representations is useful for a variety of reasons, e.g. efficient use of labeled data (semi-supervised learning), transfer learning and understanding hidden structure of data. Popular techniques for representation learning include clustering, manifold learning, kernel-learning, autoencoders, Boltzmann machines, etc. To study the relative merits of these techniques, it's essential to formalize the definition and goals of representation learning, so that they are all become instances of the same definition. This paper introduces such a formal framework that also formalizes the utility of learning the representation. It is related to previous Bayesian notions, but with some new twists. We show the usefulness of our framework by exhibiting simple and natural settings -- linear mixture models and loglinear models, where the power of representation learning can be formally shown. In these examples, representation learning can be performed provably and efficiently under plausible assumptions (despite being NP-hard), and furthermore: (i) it greatly reduces the need for labeled data (semi-supervised learning) and (ii) it allows solving classification tasks when simpler approaches like nearest neighbors require too much data (iii) it is more powerful than manifold learning methods.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Socially Supervised Representation Learning: the Role of Subjectivity in Learning Efficient Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09390v4)** | 2022-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite its rise as a prominent solution to the data inefficiency of today's machine learning models, self-supervised learning has yet to be studied from a purely multi-agent perspective. In this work, we propose that aligning internal subjective representations, which naturally arise in a multi-agent setup where agents receive partial observations of the same underlying environmental state, can lead to more data-efficient representations. We propose that multi-agent environments, where agents do not have access to the observations of others but can communicate within a limited range, guarantees a common context that can be leveraged in individual representation learning. The reason is that subjective observations necessarily refer to the same subset of the underlying environmental states and that communication about these states can freely offer a supervised signal. To highlight the importance of communication, we refer to our setting as \textit{socially supervised representation learning}. We present a minimal architecture comprised of a population of autoencoders, where we define loss functions, capturing different aspects of effective communication, and examine their effect on the learned representations. We show that our proposed architecture allows the emergence of aligned representations. The subjectivity introduced by presenting agents with distinct perspectives of the environment state contributes to learning abstract representations that outperform those learned by a single autoencoder and a population of autoencoders, presented with identical perspectives of the environment state. Altogether, our results demonstrate how communication from subjective perspectives can lead to the acquisition of more abstract representations in multi-agent systems, opening promising perspectives for future research at the intersection of representation learning and emergent communication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Induced Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.11827v1)** | 2022-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of representation learning approaches for decision making in visually complex environments. Representation learning is essential for effective reinforcement learning (RL) from high-dimensional inputs. Unsupervised representation learning approaches based on reconstruction, prediction or contrastive learning have shown substantial learning efficiency gains. Yet, they have mostly been evaluated in clean laboratory or simulated settings. In contrast, real environments are visually complex and contain substantial amounts of clutter and distractors. Unsupervised representations will learn to model such distractors, potentially impairing the agent's learning efficiency. In contrast, an alternative class of approaches, which we call task-induced representation learning, leverages task information such as rewards or demonstrations from prior tasks to focus on task-relevant parts of the scene and ignore distractors. We investigate the effectiveness of unsupervised and task-induced representation learning approaches on four visually complex environments, from Distracting DMControl to the CARLA driving simulator. For both, RL and imitation learning, we find that representation learning generally improves sample efficiency on unseen tasks even in visually complex scenes and that task-induced representations can double learning efficiency compared to unsupervised alternatives.

| **[Meta-Learning Representations for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12588v2)** | 2019-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A continual learning agent should be able to build on top of existing knowledge to learn on new data quickly while minimizing forgetting. Current intelligent systems based on neural network function approximators arguably do the opposite---they are highly prone to forgetting and rarely trained to facilitate future learning. One reason for this poor behavior is that they learn from a representation that is not explicitly trained for these two goals. In this paper, we propose OML, an objective that directly minimizes catastrophic interference by learning representations that accelerate future learning and are robust to forgetting under online updates in continual learning. We show that it is possible to learn naturally sparse representations that are more effective for online updating. Moreover, our algorithm is complementary to existing continual learning strategies, such as MER and GEM. Finally, we demonstrate that a basic online updating strategy on representations learned by OML is competitive with rehearsal based methods for continual learning. We release an implementation of our method at https://github.com/khurramjaved96/mrcl .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS19, 15 pages, 10 figures, open-source, representation learning, continual learning, online learning</p></details> |
| **[Learning Sparse Representations Incrementally in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04002v1)** | 2019-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse representations have been shown to be useful in deep reinforcement learning for mitigating catastrophic interference and improving the performance of agents in terms of cumulative reward. Previous results were based on a two step process were the representation was learned offline and the action-value function was learned online afterwards. In this paper, we investigate if it is possible to learn a sparse representation and the action-value function simultaneously and incrementally. We investigate this question by employing several regularization techniques and observing how they affect sparsity of the representation learned by a DQN agent in two different benchmark domains. Our results show that with appropriate regularization it is possible to increase the sparsity of the representations learned by DQN agents. Moreover, we found that learning sparse representations also resulted in improved performance in terms of cumulative reward. Finally, we found that the performance of the agents that learned a sparse representation was more robust to the size of the experience replay buffer. This last finding supports the long standing hypothesis that the overlap in representations learned by deep neural networks is the leading cause of catastrophic interference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Playful Interactions for Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09046v1)** | 2021-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key challenges in visual imitation learning is collecting large amounts of expert demonstrations for a given task. While methods for collecting human demonstrations are becoming easier with teleoperation methods and the use of low-cost assistive tools, we often still require 100-1000 demonstrations for every task to learn a visual representation and policy. To address this, we turn to an alternate form of data that does not require task-specific demonstrations -- play. Playing is a fundamental method children use to learn a set of skills and behaviors and visual representations in early learning. Importantly, play data is diverse, task-agnostic, and relatively cheap to obtain. In this work, we propose to use playful interactions in a self-supervised manner to learn visual representations for downstream tasks. We collect 2 hours of playful data in 19 diverse environments and use self-predictive learning to extract visual representations. Given these representations, we train policies using imitation learning for two downstream tasks: Pushing and Stacking. We demonstrate that our visual representations generalize better than standard behavior cloning and can achieve similar performance with only half the number of required demonstrations. Our representations, which are trained from scratch, compare favorably against ImageNet pretrained representations. Finally, we provide an experimental analysis on the effects of different pretraining modes on downstream task learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning by Learning to Count](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.06734v1)** | 2017-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel method for representation learning that uses an artificial supervision signal based on counting visual primitives. This supervision signal is obtained from an equivariance relation, which does not require any manual annotation. We relate transformations of images to transformations of the representations. More specifically, we look for the representation that satisfies such relation rather than the transformations that match a given representation. In this paper, we use two image transformations in the context of counting: scaling and tiling. The first transformation exploits the fact that the number of visual primitives should be invariant to scale. The second transformation allows us to equate the total number of visual primitives in each tile to that in the whole image. These two transformations are combined in one constraint and used to train a neural network with a contrastive loss. The proposed task produces representations that perform on par or exceed the state of the art in transfer learning benchmarks.</p></details> | ICCV 2017(oral) |
| **[Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.5538v3)** | 2014-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, auto-encoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer-term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation and manifold learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Matryoshka Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13147v4)** | 2024-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned representations are a central component in modern ML systems, serving a multitude of downstream tasks. When training such representations, it is often the case that computational and statistical constraints for each downstream task are unknown. In this context rigid, fixed capacity representations can be either over or under-accommodating to the task at hand. This leads us to ask: can we design a flexible representation that can adapt to multiple downstream tasks with varying computational resources? Our main contribution is Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) which encodes information at different granularities and allows a single embedding to adapt to the computational constraints of downstream tasks. MRL minimally modifies existing representation learning pipelines and imposes no additional cost during inference and deployment. MRL learns coarse-to-fine representations that are at least as accurate and rich as independently trained low-dimensional representations. The flexibility within the learned Matryoshka Representations offer: (a) up to 14x smaller embedding size for ImageNet-1K classification at the same level of accuracy; (b) up to 14x real-world speed-ups for large-scale retrieval on ImageNet-1K and 4K; and (c) up to 2% accuracy improvements for long-tail few-shot classification, all while being as robust as the original representations. Finally, we show that MRL extends seamlessly to web-scale datasets (ImageNet, JFT) across various modalities -- vision (ViT, ResNet), vision + language (ALIGN) and language (BERT). MRL code and pretrained models are open-sourced at https://github.com/RAIVNLab/MRL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Edite...</summary><p>Edited related work to include intrinsic dimensionality works</p></details> |
| **[Flow Factorized Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13167v1)** | 2023-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prominent goal of representation learning research is to achieve representations which are factorized in a useful manner with respect to the ground truth factors of variation. The fields of disentangled and equivariant representation learning have approached this ideal from a range of complimentary perspectives; however, to date, most approaches have proven to either be ill-specified or insufficiently flexible to effectively separate all realistic factors of interest in a learned latent space. In this work, we propose an alternative viewpoint on such structured representation learning which we call Flow Factorized Representation Learning, and demonstrate it to learn both more efficient and more usefully structured representations than existing frameworks. Specifically, we introduce a generative model which specifies a distinct set of latent probability paths that define different input transformations. Each latent flow is generated by the gradient field of a learned potential following dynamic optimal transport. Our novel setup brings new understandings to both \textit{disentanglement} and \textit{equivariance}. We show that our model achieves higher likelihoods on standard representation learning benchmarks while simultaneously being closer to approximately equivariant models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the transformations learned by our model are flexibly composable and can also extrapolate to new data, implying a degree of robustness and generalizability approaching the ultimate goal of usefully factorized representation learning.</p></details> | NeurIPS23 |
| **[Towards Unsupervised Representation Learning: Learning, Evaluating and Transferring Visual Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00101v1)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised representation learning aims at finding methods that learn representations from data without annotation-based signals. Abstaining from annotations not only leads to economic benefits but may - and to some extent already does - result in advantages regarding the representation's structure, robustness, and generalizability to different tasks. In the long run, unsupervised methods are expected to surpass their supervised counterparts due to the reduction of human intervention and the inherently more general setup that does not bias the optimization towards an objective originating from specific annotation-based signals. While major advantages of unsupervised representation learning have been recently observed in natural language processing, supervised methods still dominate in vision domains for most tasks. In this dissertation, we contribute to the field of unsupervised (visual) representation learning from three perspectives: (i) Learning representations: We design unsupervised, backpropagation-free Convolutional Self-Organizing Neural Networks (CSNNs) that utilize self-organization- and Hebbian-based learning rules to learn convolutional kernels and masks to achieve deeper backpropagation-free models. (ii) Evaluating representations: We build upon the widely used (non-)linear evaluation protocol to define pretext- and target-objective-independent metrics for measuring and investigating the objective function mismatch between various unsupervised pretext tasks and target tasks. (iii) Transferring representations: We contribute CARLANE, the first 3-way sim-to-real domain adaptation benchmark for 2D lane detection, and a method based on prototypical self-supervised learning. Finally, we contribute a content-consistent unpaired image-to-image translation method that utilizes masks, global and local discriminators, and similarity sampling to mitigate content inconsistencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, 223 pages, Abstract in English, Spanish and Catalan, 4 appendices</p></details> |
| **[Contextures: The Mechanism of Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19792v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This dissertation establishes the contexture theory to mathematically characterize the mechanism of representation learning, or pretraining. Despite the remarkable empirical success of foundation models, it is not very clear what representations they learn, and why these representations are useful for various downstream tasks. A scientific understanding of representation learning is critical, especially at this point when scaling up the model size is producing diminishing returns, and designing new pretraining methods is imperative for further progress. Prior work treated different representation learning methods quite differently, whereas the contexture theory provides a unified framework for analyzing these methods. The central argument is that a representation is learned from the association between the input X and a context variable A. We prove that if an encoder captures the maximum information of this association, in which case we say that the encoder learns the contexture, then it will be optimal on the class of tasks that are compatible with the context. We also show that a context is the most useful when the association between X and A is neither too strong nor too weak. The important implication of the contexture theory is that increasing the model size alone will achieve diminishing returns, and further advancements require better contexts. We demonstrate that many pretraining objectives can learn the contexture, including supervised learning, self-supervised learning, generative models, etc. Then, we introduce two general objectives -- SVME and KISE, for learning the contexture. We also show how to mix multiple contexts together, an effortless way to create better contexts from existing ones. Then, we prove statistical learning bounds for representation learning. Finally, we discuss the effect of the data distribution shift from pretraining to the downstream task.</p></details> | PhD Dissertation |

| **[Non-Parametric Representation Learning with Kernels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02028v1)** | 2023-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised and self-supervised representation learning has become popular in recent years for learning useful features from unlabelled data. Representation learning has been mostly developed in the neural network literature, and other models for representation learning are surprisingly unexplored. In this work, we introduce and analyze several kernel-based representation learning approaches: Firstly, we define two kernel Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models using contrastive loss functions and secondly, a Kernel Autoencoder (AE) model based on the idea of embedding and reconstructing data. We argue that the classical representer theorems for supervised kernel machines are not always applicable for (self-supervised) representation learning, and present new representer theorems, which show that the representations learned by our kernel models can be expressed in terms of kernel matrices. We further derive generalisation error bounds for representation learning with kernel SSL and AE, and empirically evaluate the performance of these methods in both small data regimes as well as in comparison with neural network based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Growing Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08857v1)** | 2021-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning continues to grow in popularity due to its ability to learn increasingly complex tasks. However, for many supervised models, the shift in a data distribution or the appearance of a new event can result in a severe decrease in model performance. Retraining a model from scratch with updated data can be resource intensive or impossible depending on the constraints placed on an organization or system. Continual learning methods attempt to adapt models to new classes instead of retraining. However, many of these methods do not have a detection method for new classes or make assumptions about the distribution of classes. In this paper, we develop an attention based Gaussian Mixture, called GMAT, that learns interpretable representations of data with or without labels. We incorporate this method with existing Neural Architecture Search techniques to develop an algorithm for detection new events for an optimal number of representations through an iterative process of training a growing. We show that our method is capable learning new representations of data without labels or assumptions about the distributions of labels. We additionally develop a method that allows our model to utilize labels to more accurately develop representations. Lastly, we show that our method can avoid catastrophic forgetting by replaying samples from learned representations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Exploratory State Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13596v2)** | 2022-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Not having access to compact and meaningful representations is known to significantly increase the complexity of reinforcement learning (RL). For this reason, it can be useful to perform state representation learning (SRL) before tackling RL tasks. However, obtaining a good state representation can only be done if a large diversity of transitions is observed, which can require a difficult exploration, especially if the environment is initially reward-free. To solve the problems of exploration and SRL in parallel, we propose a new approach called XSRL (eXploratory State Representation Learning). On one hand, it jointly learns compact state representations and a state transition estimator which is used to remove unexploitable information from the representations. On the other hand, it continuously trains an inverse model, and adds to the prediction error of this model a $k$-step learning progress bonus to form the maximization objective of a discovery policy. This results in a policy that seeks complex transitions from which the trained models can effectively learn. Our experimental results show that the approach leads to efficient exploration in challenging environments with image observations, and to state representations that significantly accelerate learning in RL tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Desiderata for Representation Learning: A Causal Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03795v2)** | 2022-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning constructs low-dimensional representations to summarize essential features of high-dimensional data. This learning problem is often approached by describing various desiderata associated with learned representations; e.g., that they be non-spurious, efficient, or disentangled. It can be challenging, however, to turn these intuitive desiderata into formal criteria that can be measured and enhanced based on observed data. In this paper, we take a causal perspective on representation learning, formalizing non-spuriousness and efficiency (in supervised representation learning) and disentanglement (in unsupervised representation learning) using counterfactual quantities and observable consequences of causal assertions. This yields computable metrics that can be used to assess the degree to which representations satisfy the desiderata of interest and learn non-spurious and disentangled representations from single observational datasets.</p></details> | 68 pages |
| **[Region Similarity Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.12902v2)** | 2021-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Region Similarity Representation Learning (ReSim), a new approach to self-supervised representation learning for localization-based tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While existing work has largely focused on solely learning global representations for an entire image, ReSim learns both regional representations for localization as well as semantic image-level representations. ReSim operates by sliding a fixed-sized window across the overlapping area between two views (e.g., image crops), aligning these areas with their corresponding convolutional feature map regions, and then maximizing the feature similarity across views. As a result, ReSim learns spatially and semantically consistent feature representation throughout the convolutional feature maps of a neural network. A shift or scale of an image region, e.g., a shift or scale of an object, has a corresponding change in the feature maps; this allows downstream tasks to leverage these representations for localization. Through object detection, instance segmentation, and dense pose estimation experiments, we illustrate how ReSim learns representations which significantly improve the localization and classification performance compared to a competitive MoCo-v2 baseline: $+2.7$ AP$^{\text{bb}}_{75}$ VOC, $+1.1$ AP$^{\text{bb}}_{75}$ COCO, and $+1.9$ AP$^{\text{mk}}$ Cityscapes.

| **[Feature Forgetting in Continual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13359v1)** | 2022-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In continual and lifelong learning, good representation learning can help increase performance and reduce sample complexity when learning new tasks. There is evidence that representations do not suffer from "catastrophic forgetting" even in plain continual learning, but little further fact is known about its characteristics. In this paper, we aim to gain more understanding about representation learning in continual learning, especially on the feature forgetting problem. We devise a protocol for evaluating representation in continual learning, and then use it to present an overview of the basic trends of continual representation learning, showing its consistent deficiency and potential issues. To study the feature forgetting problem, we create a synthetic dataset to identify and visualize the prevalence of feature forgetting in neural networks. Finally, we propose a simple technique using gating adapters to mitigate feature forgetting. We conclude by discussing that improving representation learning benefits both old and new tasks in continual learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Generalization of Representations in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00543v1)** | 2022-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning, state representations are used to tractably deal with large problem spaces. State representations serve both to approximate the value function with few parameters, but also to generalize to newly encountered states. Their features may be learned implicitly (as part of a neural network) or explicitly (for example, the successor representation of \citet{dayan1993improving}). While the approximation properties of representations are reasonably well-understood, a precise characterization of how and when these representations generalize is lacking. In this work, we address this gap and provide an informative bound on the generalization error arising from a specific state representation. This bound is based on the notion of effective dimension which measures the degree to which knowing the value at one state informs the value at other states. Our bound applies to any state representation and quantifies the natural tension between representations that generalize well and those that approximate well. We complement our theoretical results with an empirical survey of classic representation learning methods from the literature and results on the Arcade Learning Environment, and find that the generalization behaviour of learned representations is well-explained by their effective dimension.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AISTATS22</p></details> |
| **[Simplicial Complex Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04046v6)** | 2022-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simplicial complexes form an important class of topological spaces that are frequently used in many application areas such as computer-aided design, computer graphics, and simulation. Representation learning on graphs, which are just 1-d simplicial complexes, has witnessed a great attention in recent years. However, there has not been enough effort to extend representation learning to higher dimensional simplicial objects due to the additional complexity these objects hold, especially when it comes to entire-simplicial complex representation learning. In this work, we propose a method for simplicial complex-level representation learning that embeds a simplicial complex to a universal embedding space in a way that complex-to-complex proximity is preserved. Our method uses our novel geometric message passing schemes to learn an entire simplicial complex representation in an end-to-end fashion. We demonstrate the proposed model on publicly available mesh dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first method for learning simplicial complex-level representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MACHI...</summary><p>MACHINE LEARNING ON GRAPHS, MLoG Workshop at WSDM'22</p></details> |

| **[Disentangled Generative Graph Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13471v1)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, generative graph models have shown promising results in learning graph representations through self-supervised methods. However, most existing generative graph representation learning (GRL) approaches rely on random masking across the entire graph, which overlooks the entanglement of learned representations. This oversight results in non-robustness and a lack of explainability. Furthermore, disentangling the learned representations remains a significant challenge and has not been sufficiently explored in GRL research. Based on these insights, this paper introduces DiGGR (Disentangled Generative Graph Representation Learning), a self-supervised learning framework. DiGGR aims to learn latent disentangled factors and utilizes them to guide graph mask modeling, thereby enhancing the disentanglement of learned representations and enabling end-to-end joint learning. Extensive experiments on 11 public datasets for two different graph learning tasks demonstrate that DiGGR consistently outperforms many previous self-supervised methods, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

These representations improve generalization over large, finite action sets by allowing the agent to infer the outcomes of actions similar to actions already taken.

By subverting the need for supervised labels, such approaches are able to utilize the numerous unlabeled images that exist on the Internet and in photographic datasets. Yet to build truly intelligent agents, we must construct representation learning algorithms that can learn not only from datasets but also learn from environments. An agent in a natural environment will not typically be fed curated data. Instead, it must explore its environment to acquire the data it will learn from. We propose a framework, curious representation learning (CRL), which jointly learns a reinforcement learning policy and a visual representation model. The policy is trained to maximize the error of the representation learner, and in doing so is incentivized to explore its environment. At the same time, the learned representation becomes stronger and stronger as the policy feeds it ever harder data to learn from. Our learned representations enable promising transfer to downstream navigation tasks, performing better than or comparably to ImageNet pretraining without using any supervision at all. In addition, despite being trained in simulation, our learned representations can obtain interpretable results on real images.

The core idea of MCL is to perform mutual interaction and transfer of contrastive distributions among a cohort of networks. A crucial component of MCL is Interactive Contrastive Learning (ICL). Compared with vanilla contrastive learning, ICL can aggregate cross-network embedding information and maximize the lower bound to the mutual information between two networks. This enables each network to learn extra contrastive knowledge from others, leading to better feature representations for visual recognition tasks. We emphasize that the resulting MCL is conceptually simple yet empirically powerful. It is a generic framework that can be applied to both supervised and self-supervised representation learning. Experimental results on image classification and transfer learning to object detection show that MCL can lead to consistent performance gains, demonstrating that MCL can guide the network to generate better feature representations.

The process of separating underlying factors of variation into variables with semantic meaning benefits in learning explainable representations of data, which imitates the meaningful understanding process of humans when observing an object or relation. As a general learning strategy, DRL has demonstrated its power in improving the model explainability, controlability, robustness, as well as generalization capacity in a wide range of scenarios such as computer vision, natural language processing, and data mining. In this article, we comprehensively investigate DRL from various aspects including motivations, definitions, methodologies, evaluations, applications, and model designs. We first present two well-recognized definitions, i.e., Intuitive Definition and Group Theory Definition for disentangled representation learning. We further categorize the methodologies for DRL into four groups from the following perspectives, the model type, representation structure, supervision signal, and independence assumption. We also analyze principles to design different DRL models that may benefit different tasks in practical applications. Finally, we point out challenges in DRL as well as potential research directions deserving future investigations.

| **[Provable Benefit of Multitask Representation Learning in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.05900v1)** | 2022-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As representation learning becomes a powerful technique to reduce sample complexity in reinforcement learning (RL) in practice, theoretical understanding of its advantage is still limited. In this paper, we theoretically characterize the benefit of representation learning under the low-rank Markov decision process (MDP) model. We first study multitask low-rank RL (as upstream training), where all tasks share a common representation, and propose a new multitask reward-free algorithm called REFUEL. REFUEL learns both the transition kernel and the near-optimal policy for each task, and outputs a well-learned representation for downstream tasks. Our result demonstrates that multitask representation learning is provably more sample-efficient than learning each task individually, as long as the total number of tasks is above a certain threshold. We then study the downstream RL in both online and offline settings, where the agent is assigned with a new task sharing the same representation as the upstream tasks. For both online and offline settings, we develop a sample-efficient algorithm, and show that it finds a near-optimal policy with the suboptimality gap bounded by the sum of the estimation error of the learned representation in upstream and a vanishing term as the number of downstream samples becomes large. Our downstream results of online and offline RL further capture the benefit of employing the learned representation from upstream as opposed to learning the representation of the low-rank model directly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study that characterizes the benefit of representation learning in exploration-based reward-free multitask RL for both upstream and downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication</p></details> |
| **[On the Generalization of Learned Structured Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13001v1)** | 2023-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite tremendous progress over the past decade, deep learning methods generally fall short of human-level systematic generalization. It has been argued that explicitly capturing the underlying structure of data should allow connectionist systems to generalize in a more predictable and systematic manner. Indeed, evidence in humans suggests that interpreting the world in terms of symbol-like compositional entities may be crucial for intelligent behavior and high-level reasoning. Another common limitation of deep learning systems is that they require large amounts of training data, which can be expensive to obtain. In representation learning, large datasets are leveraged to learn generic data representations that may be useful for efficient learning of arbitrary downstream tasks. This thesis is about structured representation learning. We study methods that learn, with little or no supervision, representations of unstructured data that capture its hidden structure. In the first part of the thesis, we focus on representations that disentangle the explanatory factors of variation of the data. We scale up disentangled representation learning to a novel robotic dataset, and perform a systematic large-scale study on the role of pretrained representations for out-of-distribution generalization in downstream robotic tasks. The second part of this thesis focuses on object-centric representations, which capture the compositional structure of the input in terms of symbol-like entities, such as objects in visual scenes. Object-centric learning methods learn to form meaningful entities from unstructured input, enabling symbolic information processing on a connectionist substrate. In this study, we train a selection of methods on several common datasets, and investigate their usefulness for downstream tasks and their ability to generalize out of distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor revision of my PhD thesis: fixed hyperlinks, fixed minor typos, and compressed images.

| **[Steerable Equivariant Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.11349v1)** | 2023-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained deep image representations are useful for post-training tasks such as classification through transfer learning, image retrieval, and object detection. Data augmentations are a crucial aspect of pre-training robust representations in both supervised and self-supervised settings. Data augmentations explicitly or implicitly promote invariance in the embedding space to the input image transformations. This invariance reduces generalization to those downstream tasks which rely on sensitivity to these particular data augmentations. In this paper, we propose a method of learning representations that are instead equivariant to data augmentations. We achieve this equivariance through the use of steerable representations. Our representations can be manipulated directly in embedding space via learned linear maps. We demonstrate that our resulting steerable and equivariant representations lead to better performance on transfer learning and robustness: e.g. we improve linear probe top-1 accuracy by between 1% to 3% for transfer; and ImageNet-C accuracy by upto 3.4%. We further show that the steerability of our representations provides significant speedup (nearly 50x) for test-time augmentations; by applying a large number of augmentations for out-of-distribution detection, we significantly improve OOD AUC on the ImageNet-C dataset over an invariant representation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representational Continuity for Unsupervised Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06976v3)** | 2022-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) aims to learn a sequence of tasks without forgetting the previously acquired knowledge. However, recent CL advances are restricted to supervised continual learning (SCL) scenarios. Consequently, they are not scalable to real-world applications where the data distribution is often biased and unannotated. In this work, we focus on unsupervised continual learning (UCL), where we learn the feature representations on an unlabelled sequence of tasks and show that reliance on annotated data is not necessary for continual learning. We conduct a systematic study analyzing the learned feature representations and show that unsupervised visual representations are surprisingly more robust to catastrophic forgetting, consistently achieve better performance, and generalize better to out-of-distribution tasks than SCL. Furthermore, we find that UCL achieves a smoother loss landscape through qualitative analysis of the learned representations and learns meaningful feature representations. Additionally, we propose Lifelong Unsupervised Mixup (LUMP), a simple yet effective technique that interpolates between the current task and previous tasks' instances to alleviate catastrophic forgetting for unsupervised representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR (Oral) 2022.

We theoretically investigate offline multitask low-rank RL, and propose a new algorithm called MORL for offline multitask representation learning. Furthermore, we examine downstream RL in reward-free, offline and online scenarios, where a new task is introduced to the agent that shares the same representation as the upstream offline tasks. Our theoretical results demonstrate the benefits of using the learned representation from the upstream offline task instead of directly learning the representation of the low-rank model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Deep Inverse Feature Learning: A Representation Learning of Error](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04285v1)** | 2020-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel perspective about error in machine learning and proposes inverse feature learning (IFL) as a representation learning approach that learns a set of high-level features based on the representation of error for classification or clustering purposes. The proposed perspective about error representation is fundamentally different from current learning methods, where in classification approaches they interpret the error as a function of the differences between the true labels and the predicted ones or in clustering approaches, in which the clustering objective functions such as compactness are used. Inverse feature learning method operates based on a deep clustering approach to obtain a qualitative form of the representation of error as features. The performance of the proposed IFL method is evaluated by applying the learned features along with the original features, or just using the learned features in different classification and clustering techniques for several data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method leads to promising results in classification and especially in clustering. In classification, the proposed features along with the primary features improve the results of most of the classification methods on several popular data sets. In clustering, the performance of different clustering methods is considerably improved on different data sets. There are interesting results that show some few features of the representation of error capture highly informative aspects of primary features. We hope this paper helps to utilize the error representation learning in different feature learning domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Matryoshka Representation Learning for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07432v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning is essential for deep-neural-network-based recommender systems to capture user preferences and item features within fixed-dimensional user and item vectors. Unlike existing representation learning methods that either treat each user preference and item feature uniformly or categorize them into discrete clusters, we argue that in the real world, user preferences and item features are naturally expressed and organized in a hierarchical manner, leading to a new direction for representation learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel matryoshka representation learning method for recommendation (MRL4Rec), by which we restructure user and item vectors into matryoshka representations with incrementally dimensional and overlapping vector spaces to explicitly represent user preferences and item features at different hierarchical levels. We theoretically establish that constructing training triplets specific to each level is pivotal in guaranteeing accurate matryoshka representation learning. Subsequently, we propose the matryoshka negative sampling mechanism to construct training triplets, which further ensures the effectiveness of the matryoshka representation learning in capturing hierarchical user preferences and item features. The experiments demonstrate that MRL4Rec can consistently and substantially outperform a number of state-of-the-art competitors on several real-life datasets.

| **[Neural Discrete Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00937v2)** | 2018-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning useful representations without supervision remains a key challenge in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful generative model that learns such discrete representations. Our model, the Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE), differs from VAEs in two key ways: the encoder network outputs discrete, rather than continuous, codes; and the prior is learnt rather than static. In order to learn a discrete latent representation, we incorporate ideas from vector quantisation (VQ). Using the VQ method allows the model to circumvent issues of "posterior collapse" -- where the latents are ignored when they are paired with a powerful autoregressive decoder -- typically observed in the VAE framework. Pairing these representations with an autoregressive prior, the model can generate high quality images, videos, and speech as well as doing high quality speaker conversion and unsupervised learning of phonemes, providing further evidence of the utility of the learnt representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Interpretable Fair Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16698v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous approaches have been recently proposed for learning fair representations that mitigate unfair outcomes in prediction tasks. A key motivation for these methods is that the representations can be used by third parties with unknown objectives. However, because current fair representations are generally not interpretable, the third party cannot use these fair representations for exploration, or to obtain any additional insights, besides the pre-contracted prediction tasks. Thus, to increase data utility beyond prediction tasks, we argue that the representations need to be fair, yet interpretable. We propose a general framework for learning interpretable fair representations by introducing an interpretable "prior knowledge" during the representation learning process. We implement this idea and conduct experiments with ColorMNIST and Dsprite datasets. The results indicate that in addition to being interpretable, our representations attain slightly higher accuracy and fairer outcomes in a downstream classification task compared to state-of-the-art fair representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning with Prototypical Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11271v2)** | 2021-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning effective representations in image-based environments is crucial for sample efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unfortunately, in RL, representation learning is confounded with the exploratory experience of the agent -- learning a useful representation requires diverse data, while effective exploration is only possible with coherent representations. Furthermore, we would like to learn representations that not only generalize across tasks but also accelerate downstream exploration for efficient task-specific training. To address these challenges we propose Proto-RL, a self-supervised framework that ties representation learning with exploration through prototypical representations. These prototypes simultaneously serve as a summarization of the exploratory experience of an agent as well as a basis for representing observations. We pre-train these task-agnostic representations and prototypes on environments without downstream task information. This enables state-of-the-art downstream policy learning on a set of difficult continuous control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fairness by Learning Orthogonal Disentangled Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05707v3)** | 2020-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning discriminative powerful representations is a crucial step for machine learning systems. Introducing invariance against arbitrary nuisance or sensitive attributes while performing well on specific tasks is an important problem in representation learning. This is mostly approached by purging the sensitive information from learned representations. In this paper, we propose a novel disentanglement approach to invariant representation problem. We disentangle the meaningful and sensitive representations by enforcing orthogonality constraints as a proxy for independence. We explicitly enforce the meaningful representation to be agnostic to sensitive information by entropy maximization. The proposed approach is evaluated on five publicly available datasets and compared with state of the art methods for learning fairness and invariance achieving the state of the art performance on three datasets and comparable performance on the rest. Further, we perform an ablative study to evaluate the effect of each component.</p></details> |  |
| **[A manifold learning perspective on representation learning: Learning decoder and representations without an encoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13910v2)** | 2021-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoencoders are commonly used in representation learning. They consist of an encoder and a decoder, which provide a straightforward way to map n-dimensional data in input space to a lower m-dimensional representation space and back. The decoder itself defines an m-dimensional manifold in input space. Inspired by manifold learning, we show that the decoder can be trained on its own by learning the representations of the training samples along with the decoder weights using gradient descent. A sum-of-squares loss then corresponds to optimizing the manifold to have the smallest Euclidean distance to the training samples, and similarly for other loss functions. We derive expressions for the number of samples needed to specify the encoder and decoder and show that the decoder generally requires much less training samples to be well-specified compared to the encoder. We discuss training of autoencoders in this perspective and relate to previous work in the field that use noisy training examples and other types of regularization. On the natural image data sets MNIST and CIFAR10, we demonstrate that the decoder is much better suited to learn a low-dimensional representation, especially when trained on small data sets. Using simulated gene regulatory data, we further show that the decoder alone leads to better generalization and meaningful representations. Our approach of training the decoder alone facilitates representation learning even on small data sets and can lead to improved training of autoencoders. We hope that the simple analyses presented will also contribute to an improved conceptual understanding of representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Investigation of Representation Learning for Imitation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.07886v1)** | 2022-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning often needs a large demonstration set in order to handle the full range of situations that an agent might find itself in during deployment. However, collecting expert demonstrations can be expensive. Recent work in vision, reinforcement learning, and NLP has shown that auxiliary representation learning objectives can reduce the need for large amounts of expensive, task-specific data. Our Empirical Investigation of Representation Learning for Imitation (EIRLI) investigates whether similar benefits apply to imitation learning. We propose a modular framework for constructing representation learning algorithms, then use our framework to evaluate the utility of representation learning for imitation across several environment suites. In the settings we evaluate, we find that existing algorithms for image-based representation learning provide limited value relative to a well-tuned baseline with image augmentations. To explain this result, we investigate differences between imitation learning and other settings where representation learning has provided significant benefit, such as image classification. Finally, we release a well-documented codebase which both replicates our findings and provides a modular framework for creating new representation learning algorithms out of reusable components.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS2021 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |
| **[Learning Belief Representations for Imitation Learning in POMDPs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.09510v1)** | 2019-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of imitation learning from expert demonstrations in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Belief representations, which characterize the distribution over the latent states in a POMDP, have been modeled using recurrent neural networks and probabilistic latent variable models, and shown to be effective for reinforcement learning in POMDPs. In this work, we investigate the belief representation learning problem for generative adversarial imitation learning in POMDPs. Instead of training the belief module and the policy separately as suggested in prior work, we learn the belief module jointly with the policy, using a task-aware imitation loss to ensure that the representation is more aligned with the policy's objective. To improve robustness of representation, we introduce several informative belief regularization techniques, including multi-step prediction of dynamics and action-sequences. Evaluated on various partially observable continuous-control locomotion tasks, our belief-module imitation learning approach (BMIL) substantially outperforms several baselines, including the original GAIL algorithm and the task-agnostic belief learning algorithm. Extensive ablation analysis indicates the effectiveness of task-aware belief learning and belief regularization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2019)</p></details> |
| **[CL2R: Compatible Lifelong Learning Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09032v1)** | 2022-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a method to partially mimic natural intelligence for the problem of lifelong learning representations that are compatible. We take the perspective of a learning agent that is interested in recognizing object instances in an open dynamic universe in a way in which any update to its internal feature representation does not render the features in the gallery unusable for visual search. We refer to this learning problem as Compatible Lifelong Learning Representations (CL2R) as it considers compatible representation learning within the lifelong learning paradigm. We identify stationarity as the property that the feature representation is required to hold to achieve compatibility and propose a novel training procedure that encourages local and global stationarity on the learned representation. Due to stationarity, the statistical properties of the learned features do not change over time, making them interoperable with previously learned features. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that our CL2R training procedure outperforms alternative baselines and state-of-the-art methods. We also provide novel metrics to specifically evaluate compatible representation learning under catastrophic forgetting in various sequential learning tasks.

| **[Inverse Feature Learning: Feature learning based on Representation Learning of Error](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03689v1)** | 2020-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes inverse feature learning as a novel supervised feature learning technique that learns a set of high-level features for classification based on an error representation approach. The key contribution of this method is to learn the representation of error as high-level features, while current representation learning methods interpret error by loss functions which are obtained as a function of differences between the true labels and the predicted ones. One advantage of such learning method is that the learned features for each class are independent of learned features for other classes; therefore, this method can learn simultaneously meaning that it can learn new classes without retraining. Error representation learning can also help with generalization and reduce the chance of over-fitting by adding a set of impactful features to the original data set which capture the relationships between each instance and different classes through an error generation and analysis process. This method can be particularly effective in data sets, where the instances of each class have diverse feature representations or the ones with imbalanced classes. The experimental results show that the proposed method results in significantly better performance compared to the state-of-the-art classification techniques for several popular data sets. We hope this paper can open a new path to utilize the proposed perspective of error representation learning in different feature learning domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Internal Representations (COLT 1995)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05781v3)** | 2019-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probably the most important problem in machine learning is the preliminary biasing of a learner's hypothesis space so that it is small enough to ensure good generalisation from reasonable training sets, yet large enough that it contains a good solution to the problem being learnt. In this paper a mechanism for {\em automatically} learning or biasing the learner's hypothesis space is introduced. It works by first learning an appropriate {\em internal representation} for a learning environment and then using that representation to bias the learner's hypothesis space for the learning of future tasks drawn from the same environment. An internal representation must be learnt by sampling from {\em many similar tasks}, not just a single task as occurs in ordinary machine learning. It is proved that the number of examples $m$ {\em per task} required to ensure good generalisation from a representation learner obeys $m = O(a+b/n)$ where $n$ is the number of tasks being learnt and $a$ and $b$ are constants. If the tasks are learnt independently ({\em i.e.} without a common representation) then $m=O(a+b)$. It is argued that for learning environments such as speech and character recognition $b\gg a$ and hence representation learning in these environments can potentially yield a drastic reduction in the number of examples required per task. It is also proved that if $n = O(b)$ (with $m=O(a+b/n)$) then the representation learnt will be good for learning novel tasks from the same environment, and that the number of examples required to generalise well on a novel task will be reduced to $O(a)$ (as opposed to $O(a+b)$ if no representation is used). It is shown that gradient descent can be used to train neural network representations and experiment results are reported providing strong qualitative support for the theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

In such hierarchical structures, a higher-level controller solves tasks by iteratively communicating goals which a lower-level policy is trained to reach. Accordingly, the choice of representation -- the mapping of observation space to goal space -- is crucial. To study this problem, we develop a notion of sub-optimality of a representation, defined in terms of expected reward of the optimal hierarchical policy using this representation. We derive expressions which bound the sub-optimality and show how these expressions can be translated to representation learning objectives which may be optimized in practice. Results on a number of difficult continuous-control tasks show that our approach to representation learning yields qualitatively better representations as well as quantitatively better hierarchical policies, compared to existing methods (see videos at https://sites.google.com/view/representation-hrl).</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2019 Conference Paper</p></details> |

Drawing inspiration from the distributional hypothesis and recent work on learning sentence representations, we reformulate the problem of predicting the context in which a sentence appears as a classification problem. Given a sentence and its context, a classifier distinguishes context sentences from other contrastive sentences based on their vector representations. This allows us to efficiently learn different types of encoding functions, and we show that the model learns high-quality sentence representations. We demonstrate that our sentence representations outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised representation learning methods on several downstream NLP tasks that involve understanding sentence semantics while achieving an order of magnitude speedup in training time.</p></details> | ICLR 2018 |

With significantly fewer parameters and hyperparameters an instance of EP is competitive with and often outperforms state of the art unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods on a range of benchmark data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Supervision for Continual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13321v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of continual learning, models are designed to learn tasks one after the other. While most research has centered on supervised continual learning, there is a growing interest in unsupervised continual learning, which makes use of the vast amounts of unlabeled data. Recent studies have highlighted the strengths of unsupervised methods, particularly self-supervised learning, in providing robust representations. The improved transferability of those representations built with self-supervised methods is often associated with the role played by the multi-layer perceptron projector. In this work, we depart from this observation and reexamine the role of supervision in continual representation learning. We reckon that additional information, such as human annotations, should not deteriorate the quality of representations. Our findings show that supervised models when enhanced with a multi-layer perceptron head, can outperform self-supervised models in continual representation learning. This highlights the importance of the multi-layer perceptron projector in shaping feature transferability across a sequence of tasks in continual learning.

| **[Hierarchically Clustered Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09906v2)** | 2019-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The joint optimization of representation learning and clustering in the embedding space has experienced a breakthrough in recent years. In spite of the advance, clustering with representation learning has been limited to flat-level categories, which often involves cohesive clustering with a focus on instance relations. To overcome the limitations of flat clustering, we introduce hierarchically-clustered representation learning (HCRL), which simultaneously optimizes representation learning and hierarchical clustering in the embedding space. Compared with a few prior works, HCRL firstly attempts to consider a generation of deep embeddings from every component of the hierarchy, not just leaf components. In addition to obtaining hierarchically clustered embeddings, we can reconstruct data by the various abstraction levels, infer the intrinsic hierarchical structure, and learn the level-proportion features. We conducted evaluations with image and text domains, and our quantitative analyses showed competent likelihoods and the best accuracies compared with the baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, Under review as a conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Robustness as a Prior for Learned Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00945v2)** | 2019-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important goal in deep learning is to learn versatile, high-level feature representations of input data. However, standard networks' representations seem to possess shortcomings that, as we illustrate, prevent them from fully realizing this goal. In this work, we show that robust optimization can be re-cast as a tool for enforcing priors on the features learned by deep neural networks. It turns out that representations learned by robust models address the aforementioned shortcomings and make significant progress towards learning a high-level encoding of inputs. In particular, these representations are approximately invertible, while allowing for direct visualization and manipulation of salient input features. More broadly, our results indicate adversarial robustness as a promising avenue for improving learned representations. Our code and models for reproducing these results is available at https://git.io/robust-reps .</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning of Pretext-Invariant Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01991v1)** | 2019-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of self-supervised learning from images is to construct image representations that are semantically meaningful via pretext tasks that do not require semantic annotations for a large training set of images. Many pretext tasks lead to representations that are covariant with image transformations. We argue that, instead, semantic representations ought to be invariant under such transformations. Specifically, we develop Pretext-Invariant Representation Learning (PIRL, pronounced as "pearl") that learns invariant representations based on pretext tasks. We use PIRL with a commonly used pretext task that involves solving jigsaw puzzles. We find that PIRL substantially improves the semantic quality of the learned image representations. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in self-supervised learning from images on several popular benchmarks for self-supervised learning. Despite being unsupervised, PIRL outperforms supervised pre-training in learning image representations for object detection. Altogether, our results demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning of image representations with good invariance properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Learning via Learning the Representation, Provably](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.09434v2)** | 2021-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies few-shot learning via representation learning, where one uses $T$ source tasks with $n_1$ data per task to learn a representation in order to reduce the sample complexity of a target task for which there is only $n_2 (\ll n_1)$ data. Specifically, we focus on the setting where there exists a good \emph{common representation} between source and target, and our goal is to understand how much of a sample size reduction is possible. First, we study the setting where this common representation is low-dimensional and provide a fast rate of $O\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}\left(Φ\right)}{n_1T} + \frac{k}{n_2}\right)$; here, $Φ$ is the representation function class, $\mathcal{C}\left(Φ\right)$ is its complexity measure, and $k$ is the dimension of the representation. When specialized to linear representation functions, this rate becomes $O\left(\frac{dk}{n_1T} + \frac{k}{n_2}\right)$ where $d (\gg k)$ is the ambient input dimension, which is a substantial improvement over the rate without using representation learning, i.e. over the rate of $O\left(\frac{d}{n_2}\right)$. This result bypasses the $Ω(\frac{1}{T})$ barrier under the i.i.d. task assumption, and can capture the desired property that all $n_1T$ samples from source tasks can be \emph{pooled} together for representation learning. Next, we consider the setting where the common representation may be high-dimensional but is capacity-constrained (say in norm); here, we again demonstrate the advantage of representation learning in both high-dimensional linear regression and neural network learning. Our results demonstrate representation learning can fully utilize all $n_1T$ samples from source tasks.</p></details> | ICLR2021 |
| **[On the Limits of Learning Representations with Label-Based Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02156v1)** | 2017-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in neural network based classifiers have transformed automatic feature learning from a pipe dream of stronger AI to a routine and expected property of practical systems. Since the emergence of AlexNet every winning submission of the ImageNet challenge has employed end-to-end representation learning, and due to the utility of good representations for transfer learning, representation learning has become as an important and distinct task from supervised learning. At present, this distinction is inconsequential, as supervised methods are state-of-the-art in learning transferable representations. But recent work has shown that generative models can also be powerful agents of representation learning. Will the representations learned from these generative methods ever rival the quality of those from their supervised competitors? In this work, we argue in the affirmative, that from an information theoretic perspective, generative models have greater potential for representation learning. Based on several experimentally validated assumptions, we show that supervised learning is upper bounded in its capacity for representation learning in ways that certain generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are not. We hope that our analysis will provide a rigorous motivation for further exploration of generative representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2017 Workshop Track</p></details> |

Recently, many methods have used a wide variety of types of approaches for learning meaningful state representations in reinforcement learning, allowing better sample efficiency, generalization, and performance. This survey aims to provide a broad categorization of these methods within a model-free online setting, exploring how they tackle the learning of state representations differently. We categorize the methods into six main classes, detailing their mechanisms, benefits, and limitations. Through this taxonomy, our aim is to enhance the understanding of this field and provide a guide for new researchers. We also discuss techniques for assessing the quality of representations, and detail relevant future directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Representations Outperform Online Continually Learned Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08823v3)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning has primarily focused on the issue of catastrophic forgetting and the associated stability-plasticity tradeoffs. However, little attention has been paid to the efficacy of continually learned representations, as representations are learned alongside classifiers throughout the learning process. Our primary contribution is empirically demonstrating that existing online continually trained deep networks produce inferior representations compared to a simple pre-defined random transforms. Our approach projects raw pixels using a fixed random transform, approximating an RBF-Kernel initialized before any data is seen. We then train a simple linear classifier on top without storing any exemplars, processing one sample at a time in an online continual learning setting. This method, called RanDumb, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art continually learned representations across all standard online continual learning benchmarks. Our study reveals the significant limitations of representation learning, particularly in low-exemplar and online continual learning scenarios. Extending our investigation to popular exemplar-free scenarios with pretrained models, we find that training only a linear classifier on top of pretrained representations surpasses most continual fine-tuning and prompt-tuning strategies. Overall, our investigation challenges the prevailing assumptions about effective representation learning in online continual learning. Our code is available at://github.com/drimpossible/RanDumb.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

But despite early successes in using GANs for unsupervised representation learning, they have since been superseded by approaches based on self-supervision. In this work we show that progress in image generation quality translates to substantially improved representation learning performance. Our approach, BigBiGAN, builds upon the state-of-the-art BigGAN model, extending it to representation learning by adding an encoder and modifying the discriminator. We extensively evaluate the representation learning and generation capabilities of these BigBiGAN models, demonstrating that these generation-based models achieve the state of the art in unsupervised representation learning on ImageNet, as well as in unconditional image generation. Pretrained BigBiGAN models -- including image generators and encoders -- are available on TensorFlow Hub (https://tfhub.dev/s?publisher=deepmind&q=bigbigan).</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages.

| **[Learning Invariant Representation for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06162v1)** | 2021-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning aims to provide intelligent agents that are capable of learning continually a sequence of tasks, building on previously learned knowledge. A key challenge in this learning paradigm is catastrophically forgetting previously learned tasks when the agent faces a new one. Current rehearsal-based methods show their success in mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem by replaying samples from previous tasks during learning a new one. However, these methods are infeasible when the data of previous tasks is not accessible. In this work, we propose a new pseudo-rehearsal-based method, named learning Invariant Representation for Continual Learning (IRCL), in which class-invariant representation is disentangled from a conditional generative model and jointly used with class-specific representation to learn the sequential tasks. Disentangling the shared invariant representation helps to learn continually a sequence of tasks, while being more robust to forgetting and having better knowledge transfer. We focus on class incremental learning where there is no knowledge about task identity during inference. We empirically evaluate our proposed method on two well-known benchmarks for continual learning: split MNIST and split Fashion MNIST. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms regularization-based methods by a big margin and is better than the state-of-the-art pseudo-rehearsal-based method. Finally, we analyze the role of the shared invariant representation in mitigating the forgetting problem especially when the number of replayed samples for each previous task is small.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI Meta-Learning for Computer Vision Workshop (2021)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Representational Disparities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17533v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a fair machine learning algorithm to model interpretable differences between observed and desired human decision-making, with the latter aimed at reducing disparity in a downstream outcome impacted by the human decision. Prior work learns fair representations without considering the outcome in the decision-making process. We model the outcome disparities as arising due to the different representations of the input seen by the observed and desired decision-maker, which we term representational disparities. Our goal is to learn interpretable representational disparities which could potentially be corrected by specific nudges to the human decision, mitigating disparities in the downstream outcome; we frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem using a neural network. Under reasonable simplifying assumptions, we prove that our neural network model of the representational disparity learns interpretable weights that fully mitigate the outcome disparity. We validate objectives and interpret results using real-world German Credit, Adult, and Heritage Health datasets.</p></details> | 27 pages |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning with Relation Awareness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11122v2)** | 2022-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning on heterogeneous graphs aims to obtain meaningful node representations to facilitate various downstream tasks, such as node classification and link prediction. Existing heterogeneous graph learning methods are primarily developed by following the propagation mechanism of node representations. There are few efforts on studying the role of relations for improving the learning of more fine-grained node representations. Indeed, it is important to collaboratively learn the semantic representations of relations and discern node representations with respect to different relation types. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network, namely R-HGNN, to learn node representations on heterogeneous graphs at a fine-grained level by considering relation-aware characteristics. Specifically, a dedicated graph convolution component is first designed to learn unique node representations from each relation-specific graph separately. Then, a cross-relation message passing module is developed to improve the interactions of node representations across different relations. Also, the relation representations are learned in a layer-wise manner to capture relation semantics, which are used to guide the node representation learning process. Moreover, a semantic fusing module is presented to aggregate relation-aware node representations into a compact representation with the learned relation representations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a variety of graph learning tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods among all the tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the TKDE journal</p></details> |

Empirical evidence has revealed that representation learning plays a crucial role in endowing humans with such a capability. Inspired by this observation, we study representation learning in the sequential decision-making scenario with contextual changes. We propose an online algorithm that is able to learn and transfer context-dependent representations and show that it significantly outperforms the existing ones that do not learn representations adaptively. As a case study, we apply our algorithm to the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, a well-established test for the mental flexibility of humans in sequential decision-making. By comparing our algorithm with the standard Q-learning and Deep-Q learning algorithms, we demonstrate the benefits of adaptive representation learning.</p></details> | 3 Figures |
| **[Language-Driven Representation Learning for Robotics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12766v1)** | 2023-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in visual representation learning for robotics demonstrates the viability of learning from large video datasets of humans performing everyday tasks. Leveraging methods such as masked autoencoding and contrastive learning, these representations exhibit strong transfer to policy learning for visuomotor control. But, robot learning encompasses a diverse set of problems beyond control including grasp affordance prediction, language-conditioned imitation learning, and intent scoring for human-robot collaboration, amongst others. First, we demonstrate that existing representations yield inconsistent results across these tasks: masked autoencoding approaches pick up on low-level spatial features at the cost of high-level semantics, while contrastive learning approaches capture the opposite. We then introduce Voltron, a framework for language-driven representation learning from human videos and associated captions. Voltron trades off language-conditioned visual reconstruction to learn low-level visual patterns, and visually-grounded language generation to encode high-level semantics. We also construct a new evaluation suite spanning five distinct robot learning problems $\unicode{x2013}$ a unified platform for holistically evaluating visual representations for robotics. Through comprehensive, controlled experiments across all five problems, we find that Voltron's language-driven representations outperform the prior state-of-the-art, especially on targeted problems requiring higher-level features.</p></details> | 30 Pages, 15 Figures |
| **[Fair Sufficient Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01030v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The main objective of fair statistical modeling and machine learning is to minimize or eliminate biases that may arise from the data or the model itself, ensuring that predictions and decisions are not unjustly influenced by sensitive attributes such as race, gender, age, or other protected characteristics. In this paper, we introduce a Fair Sufficient Representation Learning (FSRL) method that balances sufficiency and fairness. Sufficiency ensures that the representation should capture all necessary information about the target variables, while fairness requires that the learned representation remains independent of sensitive attributes. FSRL is based on a convex combination of an objective function for learning a sufficient representation and an objective function that ensures fairness. Our approach manages fairness and sufficiency at the representation level, offering a novel perspective on fair representation learning. We implement this method using distance covariance, which is effective for characterizing independence between random variables. We establish the convergence properties of the learned representations. Experiments conducted on healthcase and text datasets with diverse structures demonstrate that FSRL achieves a superior trade-off between fairness and accuracy compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 11 figures, and 6 tables (1 in the main text, 5 in the appendix)</p></details> |
| **[On the Complexity of Representation Learning in Contextual Linear Bandits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09429v1)** | 2022-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contextual linear bandits, the reward function is assumed to be a linear combination of an unknown reward vector and a given embedding of context-arm pairs. In practice, the embedding is often learned at the same time as the reward vector, thus leading to an online representation learning problem. Existing approaches to representation learning in contextual bandits are either very generic (e.g., model-selection techniques or algorithms for learning with arbitrary function classes) or specialized to particular structures (e.g., nested features or representations with certain spectral properties). As a result, the understanding of the cost of representation learning in contextual linear bandit is still limited. In this paper, we take a systematic approach to the problem and provide a comprehensive study through an instance-dependent perspective. We show that representation learning is fundamentally more complex than linear bandits (i.e., learning with a given representation). In particular, learning with a given set of representations is never simpler than learning with the worst realizable representation in the set, while we show cases where it can be arbitrarily harder. We complement this result with an extensive discussion of how it relates to existing literature and we illustrate positive instances where representation learning is as complex as learning with a fixed representation and where sub-logarithmic regret is achievable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Fair and Transferable Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10673v3)** | 2020-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing learning methods which do not discriminate subgroups in the population is a central goal of algorithmic fairness. One way to reach this goal is by modifying the data representation in order to meet certain fairness constraints. In this work we measure fairness according to demographic parity. This requires the probability of the possible model decisions to be independent of the sensitive information. We argue that the goal of imposing demographic parity can be substantially facilitated within a multitask learning setting. We leverage task similarities by encouraging a shared fair representation across the tasks via low rank matrix factorization. We derive learning bounds establishing that the learned representation transfers well to novel tasks both in terms of prediction performance and fairness metrics. We present experiments on three real world datasets, showing that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Representation Learning for Gaze Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13404v1)** | 2022-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has become prevalent for learning representations in computer vision. Notably, SSL exploits contrastive learning to encourage visual representations to be invariant under various image transformations. The task of gaze estimation, on the other hand, demands not just invariance to various appearances but also equivariance to the geometric transformations. In this work, we propose a simple contrastive representation learning framework for gaze estimation, named Gaze Contrastive Learning (GazeCLR). GazeCLR exploits multi-view data to promote equivariance and relies on selected data augmentation techniques that do not alter gaze directions for invariance learning. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GazeCLR for several settings of the gaze estimation task. Particularly, our results show that GazeCLR improves the performance of cross-domain gaze estimation and yields as high as 17.2% relative improvement. Moreover, the GazeCLR framework is competitive with state-of-the-art representation learning methods for few-shot evaluation.

| **[Unsupervised Representation Learning in Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.14226v3)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This review addresses the problem of learning abstract representations of the measurement data in the context of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). While the data are often ambiguous, high-dimensional, and complex to interpret, many dynamical systems can be effectively described by a low-dimensional set of state variables. Discovering these state variables from the data is a crucial aspect for (i) improving the data efficiency, robustness, and generalization of DRL methods, (ii) tackling the curse of dimensionality, and (iii) bringing interpretability and insights into black-box DRL. This review provides a comprehensive and complete overview of unsupervised representation learning in DRL by describing the main Deep Learning tools used for learning representations of the world, providing a systematic view of the method and principles, summarizing applications, benchmarks and evaluation strategies, and discussing open challenges and future directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Model Semantics in Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03649v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The internal representations learned by deep networks are often sensitive to architecture-specific choices, raising questions about the stability, alignment, and transferability of learned structure across models. In this paper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping operators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal representations across different architectures. Building on the insights from prior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a framework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across networks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination of theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments, we demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry that is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain forms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but also improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of representational transferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled design of robust learning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Unsupervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08982v1)** | 2020-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To leverage enormous unlabeled data on distributed edge devices, we formulate a new problem in federated learning called Federated Unsupervised Representation Learning (FURL) to learn a common representation model without supervision while preserving data privacy. FURL poses two new challenges: (1) data distribution shift (Non-IID distribution) among clients would make local models focus on different categories, leading to the inconsistency of representation spaces. (2) without the unified information among clients in FURL, the representations across clients would be misaligned. To address these challenges, we propose Federated Constrastive Averaging with dictionary and alignment (FedCA) algorithm. FedCA is composed of two key modules: (1) dictionary module to aggregate the representations of samples from each client and share with all clients for consistency of representation space and (2) alignment module to align the representation of each client on a base model trained on a public data. We adopt the contrastive loss for local model training. Through extensive experiments with three evaluation protocols in IID and Non-IID settings, we demonstrate that FedCA outperforms all baselines with significant margins.</p></details> |  |

We explore the relationship between discrete latent spaces and disentangled representations by replacing the standard Gaussian variational autoencoder (VAE) with a tailored categorical variational autoencoder. We show that the underlying grid structure of categorical distributions mitigates the problem of rotational invariance associated with multivariate Gaussian distributions, acting as an efficient inductive prior for disentangled representations. We provide both analytical and empirical findings that demonstrate the advantages of discrete VAEs for learning disentangled representations. Furthermore, we introduce the first unsupervised model selection strategy that favors disentangled representations.</p></details> |  |

We consider the limitations of proto-value functions (PVFs) at accurately approximating the value function in low dimensions and we highlight the importance of features learning for an improved low-dimensional value function approximation. Then, we adopt different representation learning algorithm on graphs to learn the basis functions that best represent the value function. We empirically show that node2vec, an algorithm for scalable feature learning in networks, and the Variational Graph Auto-Encoder constantly outperform the commonly used smooth proto-value functions in low-dimensional feature space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning State Representations via Retracing in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12600v2)** | 2022-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose learning via retracing, a novel self-supervised approach for learning the state representation (and the associated dynamics model) for reinforcement learning tasks. In addition to the predictive (reconstruction) supervision in the forward direction, we propose to include "retraced" transitions for representation / model learning, by enforcing the cycle-consistency constraint between the original and retraced states, hence improve upon the sample efficiency of learning. Moreover, learning via retracing explicitly propagates information about future transitions backward for inferring previous states, thus facilitates stronger representation learning for the downstream reinforcement learning tasks. We introduce Cycle-Consistency World Model (CCWM), a concrete model-based instantiation of learning via retracing. Additionally we propose a novel adaptive "truncation" mechanism for counteracting the negative impacts brought by "irreversible" transitions such that learning via retracing can be maximally effective. Through extensive empirical studies on visual-based continuous control benchmarks, we demonstrate that CCWM achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of sample efficiency and asymptotic performance, whilst exhibiting behaviours that are indicative of stronger representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Shared Representations in Multi-task Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02041v1)** | 2016-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a paradigm in multi-task reinforcement learning (MT-RL) in which an agent is placed in an environment and needs to learn to perform a series of tasks, within this space. Since the environment does not change, there is potentially a lot of common ground amongst tasks and learning to solve them individually seems extremely wasteful. In this paper, we explicitly model and learn this shared structure as it arises in the state-action value space. We will show how one can jointly learn optimal value-functions by modifying the popular Value-Iteration and Policy-Iteration procedures to accommodate this shared representation assumption and leverage the power of multi-task supervised learning. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed model and training procedures, are able to infer good value functions, even under low samples regimes. In addition to data efficiency, we will show in our analysis, that learning abstractions of the state space jointly across tasks leads to more robust, transferable representations with the potential for better generalization. this shared representation assumption and leverage the power of multi-task supervised learning.

| **[Rotation and Translation Invariant Representation Learning with Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13995v2)** | 2023-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many computer vision applications, images are acquired with arbitrary or random rotations and translations, and in such setups, it is desirable to obtain semantic representations disentangled from the image orientation. Examples of such applications include semiconductor wafer defect inspection, plankton microscope images, and inference on single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) micro-graphs. In this work, we propose Invariant Representation Learning with Implicit Neural Representation (IRL-INR), which uses an implicit neural representation (INR) with a hypernetwork to obtain semantic representations disentangled from the orientation of the image. We show that IRL-INR can effectively learn disentangled semantic representations on more complex images compared to those considered in prior works and show that these semantic representations synergize well with SCAN to produce state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering results.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Learning Contrastive Representations for Learning with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01785v3)** | 2022-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are able to memorize noisy labels easily with a softmax cross-entropy (CE) loss. Previous studies attempted to address this issue focus on incorporating a noise-robust loss function to the CE loss. However, the memorization issue is alleviated but still remains due to the non-robust CE loss. To address this issue, we focus on learning robust contrastive representations of data on which the classifier is hard to memorize the label noise under the CE loss. We propose a novel contrastive regularization function to learn such representations over noisy data where label noise does not dominate the representation learning. By theoretically investigating the representations induced by the proposed regularization function, we reveal that the learned representations keep information related to true labels and discard information related to corrupted labels. Moreover, our theoretical results also indicate that the learned representations are robust to the label noise. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated with experiments on benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proper Laplacian Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10833v2)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to learn good representations of states is essential for solving large reinforcement learning problems, where exploration, generalization, and transfer are particularly challenging. The Laplacian representation is a promising approach to address these problems by inducing informative state encoding and intrinsic rewards for temporally-extended action discovery and reward shaping. To obtain the Laplacian representation one needs to compute the eigensystem of the graph Laplacian, which is often approximated through optimization objectives compatible with deep learning approaches. These approximations, however, depend on hyperparameters that are impossible to tune efficiently, converge to arbitrary rotations of the desired eigenvectors, and are unable to accurately recover the corresponding eigenvalues. In this paper we introduce a theoretically sound objective and corresponding optimization algorithm for approximating the Laplacian representation. Our approach naturally recovers both the true eigenvectors and eigenvalues while eliminating the hyperparameter dependence of previous approximations. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method and we show that those results translate empirically into robust learning across multiple environments.</p></details> |  |

Prior works on learning linear representations for meta-learning assume that there is a common shared representation across different tasks, and do not consider the additional task-specific observable side information. In this work, we model the meta-parameter through an order-$3$ tensor, which can adapt to the observed task features of the task. We propose two methods to estimate the underlying tensor. The first method solves a tensor regression problem and works under natural assumptions on the data generating process. The second method uses the method of moments under additional distributional assumptions and has an improved sample complexity in terms of the number of tasks. We also focus on the meta-test phase, and consider estimating task-specific parameters on a new task. Substituting the estimated tensor from the first step allows us estimating the task-specific parameters with very few samples of the new task, thereby showing the benefits of learning tensor representations for meta-learning. Finally, through simulation and several real-world datasets, we evaluate our methods and show that it improves over previous linear models of shared representations for meta-learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forth...</summary><p>Forthcoming at AISTATS-2022</p></details> |

State representation learning (SRL) focuses on a particular kind of representation learning where learned features are in low dimension, evolve through time, and are influenced by actions of an agent. The representation is learned to capture the variation in the environment generated by the agent's actions; this kind of representation is particularly suitable for robotics and control scenarios. In particular, the low dimension characteristic of the representation helps to overcome the curse of dimensionality, provides easier interpretation and utilization by humans and can help improve performance and speed in policy learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning. This survey aims at covering the state-of-the-art on state representation learning in the most recent years. It reviews different SRL methods that involve interaction with the environment, their implementations and their applications in robotics control tasks (simulated or real). In particular, it highlights how generic learning objectives are differently exploited in the reviewed algorithms. Finally, it discusses evaluation methods to assess the representation learned and summarizes current and future lines of research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning on Large and Small Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.09873v1)** | 2017-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning owes its success to three key factors: scale of data, enhanced models to learn representations from data, and scale of computation. This book chapter presented the importance of the data-driven approach to learn good representations from both big data and small data. In terms of big data, it has been widely accepted in the research community that the more data the better for both representation and classification improvement. The question is then how to learn representations from big data, and how to perform representation learning when data is scarce. We addressed the first question by presenting CNN model enhancements in the aspects of representation, optimization, and generalization. To address the small data challenge, we showed transfer representation learning to be effective. Transfer representation learning transfers the learned representation from a source domain where abundant training data is available to a target domain where training data is scarce. Transfer representation learning gave the OM and melanoma diagnosis modules of our XPRIZE Tricorder device (which finished $2^{nd}$ out of $310$ competing teams) a significant boost in diagnosis accuracy.</p></details> | Book chapter |
| **[Provable Meta-Learning of Linear Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11684v5)** | 2022-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, seeks to design algorithms that can utilize previous experience to rapidly learn new skills or adapt to new environments. Representation learning -- a key tool for performing meta-learning -- learns a data representation that can transfer knowledge across multiple tasks, which is essential in regimes where data is scarce. Despite a recent surge of interest in the practice of meta-learning, the theoretical underpinnings of meta-learning algorithms are lacking, especially in the context of learning transferable representations. In this paper, we focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression -- in which multiple linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation. Here, we provide provably fast, sample-efficient algorithms to address the dual challenges of (1) learning a common set of features from multiple, related tasks, and (2) transferring this knowledge to new, unseen tasks. Both are central to the general problem of meta-learning. Finally, we complement these results by providing information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample complexity of learning these linear features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Lower...</summary><p>Lower bound slightly improved to include task diversity parameter</p></details> |
| **[Representation Learning by Ranking across multiple tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15093v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, representation learning has become the research focus of the machine learning community. Large-scale neural networks are a crucial step toward achieving general intelligence, with their success largely attributed to their ability to learn abstract representations of data. Several learning fields are actively discussing how to learn representations, yet there is a lack of a unified perspective. We convert the representation learning problem under different tasks into a ranking problem. By adopting the ranking problem as a unified perspective, representation learning tasks can be solved in a unified manner by optimizing the ranking loss. Experiments under various learning tasks, such as classification, retrieval, multi-label learning, and regression, prove the superiority of the representation learning by ranking framework. Furthermore, experiments under self-supervised learning tasks demonstrate the significant advantage of the ranking framework in processing unsupervised training data, with data augmentation techniques further enhancing its performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stackelberg Coupling of Online Representation Learning and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07452v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Q-learning jointly learns representations and values within monolithic networks, promising beneficial co-adaptation between features and value estimates. Although this architecture has attained substantial success, the coupling between representation and value learning creates instability as representations must constantly adapt to non-stationary value targets, while value estimates depend on these shifting representations. This is compounded by high variance in bootstrapped targets, which causes bias in value estimation in off-policy methods. We introduce Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER), a framework for value-based RL that views representation and Q-learning as two strategic agents in a hierarchical game. SCORER models the Q-function as the leader, which commits to its strategy by updating less frequently, while the perception network (encoder) acts as the follower, adapting more frequently to learn representations that minimize Bellman error variance given the leader's committed strategy. Through this division of labor, the Q-function minimizes MSBE while perception minimizes its variance, thereby reducing bias accordingly, with asymmetric updates allowing stable co-adaptation, unlike simultaneous parameter updates in monolithic solutions. Our proposed SCORER framework leads to a bi-level optimization problem whose solution is approximated by a two-timescale algorithm that creates an asymmetric learning dynamic between the two players. Extensive experiments on DQN and its variants demonstrate that gains stem from algorithmic insight rather than model complexity.</p></details> |  |

While previously limited to predicting missing parts of an input, we explore how to generalize the JEPA prediction task to a broader set of corruptions. We introduce Image World Models, an approach that goes beyond masked image modeling and learns to predict the effect of global photometric transformations in latent space. We study the recipe of learning performant IWMs and show that it relies on three key aspects: conditioning, prediction difficulty, and capacity. Additionally, we show that the predictive world model learned by IWM can be adapted through finetuning to solve diverse tasks; a fine-tuned IWM world model matches or surpasses the performance of previous self-supervised methods. Finally, we show that learning with an IWM allows one to control the abstraction level of the learned representations, learning invariant representations such as contrastive methods, or equivariant representations such as masked image modelling.</p></details> | 23 pages, 16 figures |
| **[DeepWalk: Online Learning of Social Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6652v2)** | 2014-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present DeepWalk, a novel approach for learning latent representations of vertices in a network. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide $F_1$ scores up to 10% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Momentum Contrast Speaker Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11457v1)** | 2020-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised representation learning has shown remarkable achievement by reducing the performance gap with supervised feature learning, especially in the image domain. In this study, to extend the technique of unsupervised learning to the speech domain, we propose the Momentum Contrast for VoxCeleb (MoCoVox) as a form of learning mechanism. We pre-trained the MoCoVox on the VoxCeleb1 by implementing instance discrimination. Applying MoCoVox for speaker verification revealed that it outperforms the state-of-the-art metric learning-based approach by a large margin. We also empirically demonstrate the features of contrastive learning in the speech domain by analyzing the distribution of learned representations. Furthermore, we explored which pretext task is adequate for speaker verification. We expect that learning speaker representation without human supervision helps to address the open-set speaker recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scale-invariant representation of machine learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02914v2)** | 2022-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of machine learning has resulted from its structured representation of data. Similar data have close internal representations as compressed codes for classification or emerged labels for clustering. We observe that the frequency of internal codes or labels follows power laws in both supervised and unsupervised learning models. This scale-invariant distribution implies that machine learning largely compresses frequent typical data, and simultaneously, differentiates many atypical data as outliers. In this study, we derive the process by which these power laws can naturally arise in machine learning. In terms of information theory, the scale-invariant representation corresponds to a maximally uncertain data grouping among possible representations that guarantee a given learning accuracy.</p></details> |  |

We propose the Code BERT (CoBERT) approach for self-supervised speech representation learning. The idea is to convert an utterance to a sequence of discrete codes, and perform code representation learning, where we predict the code representations based on a masked view of the original speech input. Unlike the prior self-distillation approaches of which the teacher and the student are of the same modality, our target model predicts representations from a different modality. CoBERT outperforms the most recent state-of-the-art performance on the ASR task and brings significant improvements on the SUPERB speech translation (ST) task.

| **[Information Competing Process for Learning Diversified Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01288v3)** | 2019-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning representations with diversified information remains as an open problem. Towards learning diversified representations, a new approach, termed Information Competing Process (ICP), is proposed in this paper. Aiming to enrich the information carried by feature representations, ICP separates a representation into two parts with different mutual information constraints. The separated parts are forced to accomplish the downstream task independently in a competitive environment which prevents the two parts from learning what each other learned for the downstream task. Such competing parts are then combined synergistically to complete the task. By fusing representation parts learned competitively under different conditions, ICP facilitates obtaining diversified representations which contain rich information. Experiments on image classification and image reconstruction tasks demonstrate the great potential of ICP to learn discriminative and disentangled representations in both supervised and self-supervised learning settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept as a NeurIPS 2019 paper</p></details> |

We address this need through our proposed approach, RELAX, which is the first approach for attribution-based explanations of representations. Our approach can also model the uncertainty in its explanations, which is essential to produce trustworthy explanations. RELAX explains representations by measuring similarities in the representation space between an input and masked out versions of itself, providing intuitive explanations and significantly outperforming the gradient-based baseline. We provide theoretical interpretations of RELAX and conduct a novel analysis of feature extractors trained using supervised and unsupervised learning, providing insights into different learning strategies. Finally, we illustrate the usability of RELAX in multi-view clustering and highlight that incorporating uncertainty can be essential for providing low-complexity explanations, taking a crucial step towards explaining representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Edge Representation Learning with Hypergraphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15845v2)** | 2021-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have recently achieved remarkable success in representing graph-structured data, with rapid progress in both the node embedding and graph pooling methods. Yet, they mostly focus on capturing information from the nodes considering their connectivity, and not much work has been done in representing the edges, which are essential components of a graph. However, for tasks such as graph reconstruction and generation, as well as graph classification tasks for which the edges are important for discrimination, accurately representing edges of a given graph is crucial to the success of the graph representation learning. To this end, we propose a novel edge representation learning framework based on Dual Hypergraph Transformation (DHT), which transforms the edges of a graph into the nodes of a hypergraph. This dual hypergraph construction allows us to apply message-passing techniques for node representations to edges. After obtaining edge representations from the hypergraphs, we then cluster or drop edges to obtain holistic graph-level edge representations. We validate our edge representation learning method with hypergraphs on diverse graph datasets for graph representation and generation performance, on which our method largely outperforms existing graph representation learning methods. Moreover, our edge representation learning and pooling method also largely outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification, not only because of its accurate edge representation learning, but also due to its lossless compression of the nodes and removal of irrelevant edges for effective message-passing.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2021 |
| **[On the Importance of Feature Decorrelation for Unsupervised Representation Learning in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05637v1)** | 2023-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, unsupervised representation learning (URL) has improved the sample efficiency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) by pretraining a model from a large unlabeled dataset. The underlying principle of these methods is to learn temporally predictive representations by predicting future states in the latent space. However, an important challenge of this approach is the representational collapse, where the subspace of the latent representations collapses into a low-dimensional manifold. To address this issue, we propose a novel URL framework that causally predicts future states while increasing the dimension of the latent manifold by decorrelating the features in the latent space. Through extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate that our framework effectively learns predictive representations without collapse, which significantly improves the sample efficiency of state-of-the-art URL methods on the Atari 100k benchmark.

| **[Partitioning Image Representation in Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.10454v3)** | 2022-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contrastive learning in the image domain, the anchor and positive samples are forced to have as close representations as possible. However, forcing the two samples to have the same representation could be misleading because the data augmentation techniques make the two samples different. In this paper, we introduce a new representation, partitioned representation, which can learn both common and unique features of the anchor and positive samples in contrastive learning. The partitioned representation consists of two parts: the content part and the style part. The content part represents common features of the class, and the style part represents the own features of each sample, which can lead to the representation of the data augmentation method. We can achieve the partitioned representation simply by decomposing a loss function of contrastive learning into two terms on the two separate representations, respectively. To evaluate our representation with two parts, we take two framework models: Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and BootstrapYour Own Latent(BYOL) to show the separability of content and style, and to confirm the generalization ability in classification, respectively. Based on the experiments, we show that our approach can separate two types of information in the VAE framework and outperforms the conventional BYOL in linear separability and a few-shot learning task as downstream tasks.</p></details> | 7 pages |

| **[Graph Transformers: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09777v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph transformers are a recent advancement in machine learning, offering a new class of neural network models for graph-structured data. The synergy between transformers and graph learning demonstrates strong performance and versatility across various graph-related tasks. This survey provides an in-depth review of recent progress and challenges in graph transformer research. We begin with foundational concepts of graphs and transformers. We then explore design perspectives of graph transformers, focusing on how they integrate graph inductive biases and graph attention mechanisms into the transformer architecture. Furthermore, we propose a taxonomy classifying graph transformers based on depth, scalability, and pre-training strategies, summarizing key principles for effective development of graph transformer models. Beyond technical analysis, we discuss the applications of graph transformer models for node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks, exploring their potential in other application scenarios as well. Finally, we identify remaining challenges in the field, such as scalability and efficiency, generalization and robustness, interpretability and explainability, dynamic and complex graphs, as well as data quality and diversity, charting future directions for graph transformer research.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Transformers as Graph-to-Graph Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17936v1)** | 2023-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that Transformers are essentially graph-to-graph models, with sequences just being a special case. Attention weights are functionally equivalent to graph edges. Our Graph-to-Graph Transformer architecture makes this ability explicit, by inputting graph edges into the attention weight computations and predicting graph edges with attention-like functions, thereby integrating explicit graphs into the latent graphs learned by pretrained Transformers. Adding iterative graph refinement provides a joint embedding of input, output, and latent graphs, allowing non-autoregressive graph prediction to optimise the complete graph without any bespoke pipeline or decoding strategy. Empirical results show that this architecture achieves state-of-the-art accuracies for modelling a variety of linguistic structures, integrating very effectively with the latent linguistic representations learned by pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Big Picture workshop at EMNLP 2023</p></details> |
| **[Attending to Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04181v3)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, transformer architectures for graphs emerged as an alternative to established techniques for machine learning with graphs, such as (message-passing) graph neural networks. So far, they have shown promising empirical results, e.g., on molecular prediction datasets, often attributed to their ability to circumvent graph neural networks' shortcomings, such as over-smoothing and over-squashing. Here, we derive a taxonomy of graph transformer architectures, bringing some order to this emerging field. We overview their theoretical properties, survey structural and positional encodings, and discuss extensions for important graph classes, e.g., 3D molecular graphs. Empirically, we probe how well graph transformers can recover various graph properties, how well they can deal with heterophilic graphs, and to what extent they prevent over-squashing. Further, we outline open challenges and research direction to stimulate future work. Our code is available at https://github.com/luis-mueller/probing-graph-transformers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exphormer: Sparse Transformers for Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06147v2)** | 2023-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph transformers have emerged as a promising architecture for a variety of graph learning and representation tasks. Despite their successes, though, it remains challenging to scale graph transformers to large graphs while maintaining accuracy competitive with message-passing networks. In this paper, we introduce Exphormer, a framework for building powerful and scalable graph transformers. Exphormer consists of a sparse attention mechanism based on two mechanisms: virtual global nodes and expander graphs, whose mathematical characteristics, such as spectral expansion, pseduorandomness, and sparsity, yield graph transformers with complexity only linear in the size of the graph, while allowing us to prove desirable theoretical properties of the resulting transformer models. We show that incorporating Exphormer into the recently-proposed GraphGPS framework produces models with competitive empirical results on a wide variety of graph datasets, including state-of-the-art results on three datasets. We also show that Exphormer can scale to datasets on larger graphs than shown in previous graph transformer architectures.

| **[Adaptively Transforming Graph Matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.10160v1)** | 2018-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, many graph matching methods that incorporate pairwise constraint and that can be formulated as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP) have been proposed. Although these methods demonstrate promising results for the graph matching problem, they have high complexity in space or time. In this paper, we introduce an adaptively transforming graph matching (ATGM) method from the perspective of functional representation. More precisely, under a transformation formulation, we aim to match two graphs by minimizing the discrepancy between the original graph and the transformed graph. With a linear representation map of the transformation, the pairwise edge attributes of graphs are explicitly represented by unary node attributes, which enables us to reduce the space and time complexity significantly. Due to an efficient Frank-Wolfe method-based optimization strategy, we can handle graphs with hundreds and thousands of nodes within an acceptable amount of time. Meanwhile, because transformation map can preserve graph structures, a domain adaptation-based strategy is proposed to remove the outliers. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art graph matching algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology-Informed Graph Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02005v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have revolutionized performance in Natural Language Processing and Vision, paving the way for their integration with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). One key challenge in enhancing graph transformers is strengthening the discriminative power of distinguishing isomorphisms of graphs, which plays a crucial role in boosting their predictive performances. To address this challenge, we introduce 'Topology-Informed Graph Transformer (TIGT)', a novel transformer enhancing both discriminative power in detecting graph isomorphisms and the overall performance of Graph Transformers. TIGT consists of four components: A topological positional embedding layer using non-isomorphic universal covers based on cyclic subgraphs of graphs to ensure unique graph representation: A dual-path message-passing layer to explicitly encode topological characteristics throughout the encoder layers: A global attention mechanism: And a graph information layer to recalibrate channel-wise graph features for better feature representation. TIGT outperforms previous Graph Transformers in classifying synthetic dataset aimed at distinguishing isomorphism classes of graphs. Additionally, mathematical analysis and empirical evaluations highlight our model's competitive edge over state-of-the-art Graph Transformers across various benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Geometry-grounded Representation Learning and Generative Modeling Workshop (GRaM) at ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Generalization of Transformer Networks to Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09699v2)** | 2021-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a generalization of transformer neural network architecture for arbitrary graphs. The original transformer was designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP), which operates on fully connected graphs representing all connections between the words in a sequence. Such architecture does not leverage the graph connectivity inductive bias, and can perform poorly when the graph topology is important and has not been encoded into the node features. We introduce a graph transformer with four new properties compared to the standard model. First, the attention mechanism is a function of the neighborhood connectivity for each node in the graph. Second, the positional encoding is represented by the Laplacian eigenvectors, which naturally generalize the sinusoidal positional encodings often used in NLP. Third, the layer normalization is replaced by a batch normalization layer, which provides faster training and better generalization performance. Finally, the architecture is extended to edge feature representation, which can be critical to tasks s.a. chemistry (bond type) or link prediction (entity relationship in knowledge graphs). Numerical experiments on a graph benchmark demonstrate the performance of the proposed graph transformer architecture. This work closes the gap between the original transformer, which was designed for the limited case of line graphs, and graph neural networks, that can work with arbitrary graphs. As our architecture is simple and generic, we believe it can be used as a black box for future applications that wish to consider transformer and graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2021 Workshop on Deep Learning on Graphs: Methods and Applications (DLG-AAAI 2021); Code at https://github.com/graphdeeplearning/graphtransformer</p></details> |

In comparison to the structure descriptor of the original graph $\mathbb{Q}$, the topological descriptor of its transformation graphs displays distinct characteristics related to structure. Thus, a compound's transformation graphs descriptors can be used to model a variety of structural features of the underlying chemical. In this work, the concept of transformation graphs are extended giving rise to novel class of graphs, the $(r,s)$- generalised transformation graphs, whose vertex set is union of $r$ copies of $\mathbb{V(Q)}$ and $s$ copies of $\mathbb{E(Q)}$, where, $r, s \in N$ and the edge set are defined under certain conditions. Further, these class of graphs are analysed with the help of first Zagreb index. Mainly, there are eight transformation graphs based on the criteria for edge set, but under the concept of $(r,s)$- generalised transformation graphs, infinite number of graphs can be described and analysed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilevel Typed Graph Transformations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14612v1)** | 2020-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilevel modeling extends traditional modeling techniques with a potentially unlimited number of abstraction levels. Multilevel models can be formally represented by multilevel typed graphs whose manipulation and transformation are carried out by multilevel typed graph transformation rules. These rules are cospans of three graphs and two inclusion graph homomorphisms where the three graphs are multilevel typed over a common typing chain. In this paper, we show that typed graph transformations can be appropriately generalized to multilevel typed graph transformations improving preciseness, flexibility and reusability of transformation rules. We identify type compatibility conditions, for rules and their matches, formulated as equations and inequations, respectively, between composed partial typing morphisms. These conditions are crucial presuppositions for the application of a rule for a match---based on a pushout and a final pullback complement construction for the underlying graphs in the category Graph---to always provide a well-defined canonical result in the multilevel typed setting. Moreover, to formalize and analyze multilevel typing as well as to prove the necessary results, in a systematic way, we introduce the category Chain of typing chains and typing chain morphisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2020)</p></details> |

These primitives are local in the sense that each node can apply them based on local knowledge and by affecting only its $1$-neighborhood. Although the specific set of primitives we consider makes it possible to transform any (weakly) connected graph into any other (weakly) connected graph consisting of the same nodes, they cannot disconnect the graph or introduce new nodes into the graph, making them ideal in the context of supervised overlay network transformations. We prove that computing a minimum sequence of primitive applications (even centralized) for arbitrary $G_s$ and $G_t$ is NP-hard, which we conjecture to hold for any set of local graph transformation primitives satisfying the aforementioned properties. On the other hand, we show that this problem admits a polynomial time algorithm with a constant approximation ratio.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This publication is the full version of a paper that appeared at ICALP'19</p></details> |

In order to express such transformations, we leverage queries formulated in the Graph Pattern Calculus (GPC), which is an abstraction of the common core of recent standard graph query languages, GQL and SQL/PGQ. In contrast to previous frameworks targeting graph topology only, we focus on the impact of data values on the transformations--which is crucial in addressing users needs. In particular, we study the complexity of checking if the transformation rules do not specify conflicting values for properties, and we show this is closely related to the satisfiability problem for GPC. We prove that both problems are PSpace-complete. We have implemented our framework in openCypher. We show the flexibility and usability of our framework by leveraging an existing data integration benchmark, adapting it to our needs. We also evaluate the incurred overhead of detecting potential inconsistencies at run-time, and the impact of several optimization tools in a Cypher-based graph database, by providing a comprehensive comparison of different implementation variants. The results of our experimental study show that our framework exhibits large practical benefits for transforming property graphs compared to ad-hoc transformation scripts.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in VLDB 2024</p></details> |

The core insight of our method is to fully consider the information propagation among nodes and edges in a graph when building the attention module in the transformer blocks. Specifically, we propose a new attention mechanism called Graph Propagation Attention (GPA). It explicitly passes the information among nodes and edges in three ways, i.e. node-to-node, node-to-edge, and edge-to-node, which is essential for learning graph-structured data. On this basis, we design an effective transformer architecture named Graph Propagation Transformer (GPTrans) to further help learn graph data. We verify the performance of GPTrans in a wide range of graph learning experiments on several benchmark datasets. These results show that our method outperforms many state-of-the-art transformer-based graph models with better performance.

| **[Theoretical Insights into Line Graph Transformation on Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16138v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Line graph transformation has been widely studied in graph theory, where each node in a line graph corresponds to an edge in the original graph. This has inspired a series of graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to transformed line graphs, which have proven effective in various graph representation learning tasks. However, there is limited theoretical study on how line graph transformation affects the expressivity of GNN models. In this study, we focus on two types of graphs known to be challenging to the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) tests: Cai-Fürer-Immerman (CFI) graphs and strongly regular graphs, and show that applying line graph transformation helps exclude these challenging graph properties, thus potentially assist WL tests in distinguishing these graphs. We empirically validate our findings by conducting a series of experiments that compare the accuracy and efficiency of graph isomorphism tests and GNNs on both line-transformed and original graphs across these graph structure types.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, code available at https://github.com/lukeyf/graphs-and-lines</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Graph Topology-Aware Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19779v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing efforts are dedicated to designing many topologies and graph-aware strategies for the graph Transformer, which greatly improve the model's representation capabilities. However, manually determining the suitable Transformer architecture for a specific graph dataset or task requires extensive expert knowledge and laborious trials. This paper proposes an evolutionary graph Transformer architecture search framework (EGTAS) to automate the construction of strong graph Transformers. We build a comprehensive graph Transformer search space with the micro-level and macro-level designs. EGTAS evolves graph Transformer topologies at the macro level and graph-aware strategies at the micro level. Furthermore, a surrogate model based on generic architectural coding is proposed to directly predict the performance of graph Transformers, substantially reducing the evaluation cost of evolutionary search. We demonstrate the efficacy of EGTAS across a range of graph-level and node-level tasks, encompassing both small-scale and large-scale graph datasets. Experimental results and ablation studies show that EGTAS can construct high-performance architectures that rival state-of-the-art manual and automated baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems</p></details> |
| **[Transforming Graphs for Enhanced Attribute Clustering: An Innovative Graph Transformer-Based Method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11307v3)** | 2023-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Representation Learning (GRL) is an influential methodology, enabling a more profound understanding of graph-structured data and aiding graph clustering, a critical task across various domains. The recent incursion of attention mechanisms, originally an artifact of Natural Language Processing (NLP), into the realm of graph learning has spearheaded a notable shift in research trends. Consequently, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Attention Auto-Encoders have emerged as preferred tools for graph clustering tasks. Yet, these methods primarily employ a local attention mechanism, thereby curbing their capacity to apprehend the intricate global dependencies between nodes within graphs. Addressing these impediments, this study introduces an innovative method known as the Graph Transformer Auto-Encoder for Graph Clustering (GTAGC). By melding the Graph Auto-Encoder with the Graph Transformer, GTAGC is adept at capturing global dependencies between nodes. This integration amplifies the graph representation and surmounts the constraints posed by the local attention mechanism. The architecture of GTAGC encompasses graph embedding, integration of the Graph Transformer within the autoencoder structure, and a clustering component. It strategically alternates between graph embedding and clustering, thereby tailoring the Graph Transformer for clustering tasks, whilst preserving the graph's global structural information. Through extensive experimentation on diverse benchmark datasets, GTAGC has exhibited superior performance against existing state-of-the-art graph clustering methodologies.</p></details> |  |

We show how Transformers can be viewed as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens, where the self-attention mechanism capture the relative importance of all tokens w.r.t. each-other, and positional encodings provide hints about sequential ordering or structure. Thus, Transformers are expressive set processing networks that learn relationships among input elements without being constrained by apriori graphs. Despite this mathematical connection to GNNs, Transformers are implemented via dense matrix operations that are significantly more efficient on modern hardware than sparse message passing. This leads to the perspective that Transformers are GNNs currently winning the hardware lottery.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a technical version of an article in The Gradient at https://thegradient.pub/transformers-are-graph-neural-networks/</p></details> |
| **[Graph Masked Autoencoders with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08391v2)** | 2022-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, transformers have shown promising performance in learning graph representations. However, there are still some challenges when applying transformers to real-world scenarios due to the fact that deep transformers are hard to train from scratch and the quadratic memory consumption w.r.t. the number of nodes. In this paper, we propose Graph Masked Autoencoders (GMAEs), a self-supervised transformer-based model for learning graph representations. To address the above two challenges, we adopt the masking mechanism and the asymmetric encoder-decoder design. Specifically, GMAE takes partially masked graphs as input, and reconstructs the features of the masked nodes. The encoder and decoder are asymmetric, where the encoder is a deep transformer and the decoder is a shallow transformer. The masking mechanism and the asymmetric design make GMAE a memory-efficient model compared with conventional transformers. We show that, when serving as a conventional self-supervised graph representation model, GMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the graph classification task and the node classification task under common downstream evaluation protocols. We also show that, compared with training in an end-to-end manner from scratch, we can achieve comparable performance after pre-training and fine-tuning using GMAE while simplifying the training process.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Structure-Preserving Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16176v1)** | 2024-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transformer architecture has shown remarkable success in various domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. When it comes to graph learning, transformers are required not only to capture the interactions between pairs of nodes but also to preserve graph structures connoting the underlying relations and proximity between them, showing the expressive power to capture different graph structures. Accordingly, various structure-preserving graph transformers have been proposed and widely used for various tasks, such as graph-level tasks in bioinformatics and chemoinformatics. However, strategies related to graph structure preservation have not been well organized and systematized in the literature. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of structure-preserving graph transformers and generalize these methods from the perspective of their design objective. First, we divide strategies into four main groups: node feature modulation, context node sampling, graph rewriting, and transformer architecture improvements. We then further divide the strategies according to the coverage and goals of graph structure preservation. Furthermore, we also discuss challenges and future directions for graph transformer models to preserve the graph structure and understand the nature of graphs.</p></details> | 12 |
| **[Transformers over Directed Acyclic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13148v6)** | 2023-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer models have recently gained popularity in graph representation learning as they have the potential to learn complex relationships beyond the ones captured by regular graph neural networks. The main research question is how to inject the structural bias of graphs into the transformer architecture, and several proposals have been made for undirected molecular graphs and, recently, also for larger network graphs. In this paper, we study transformers over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and propose architecture adaptations tailored to DAGs: (1) An attention mechanism that is considerably more efficient than the regular quadratic complexity of transformers and at the same time faithfully captures the DAG structure, and (2) a positional encoding of the DAG's partial order, complementing the former. We rigorously evaluate our approach over various types of tasks, ranging from classifying source code graphs to nodes in citation networks, and show that it is effective in two important aspects: in making graph transformers generally outperform graph neural networks tailored to DAGs and in improving SOTA graph transformer performance in terms of both quality and efficiency.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2023 |
| **[Deformable Graph Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.14337v2)** | 2022-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have recently shown success in representation learning on graph-structured data beyond natural language processing and computer vision. However, the success is limited to small-scale graphs due to the drawbacks of full dot-product attention on graphs such as the quadratic complexity with respect to the number of nodes and message aggregation from enormous irrelevant nodes. To address these issues, we propose Deformable Graph Transformer (DGT) that performs sparse attention via dynamically sampled relevant nodes for efficiently handling large-scale graphs with a linear complexity in the number of nodes. Specifically, our framework first constructs multiple node sequences with various criteria to consider both structural and semantic proximity. Then, combining with our learnable Katz Positional Encodings, the sparse attention is applied to the node sequences for learning node representations with a significantly reduced computational cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 graph benchmark datasets with 2.5 - 449 times less computational cost compared to transformer-based graph models with full attention.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Are More Layers Beneficial to Graph Transformers?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.00579v1)** | 2023-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite that going deep has proven successful in many neural architectures, the existing graph transformers are relatively shallow. In this work, we explore whether more layers are beneficial to graph transformers, and find that current graph transformers suffer from the bottleneck of improving performance by increasing depth. Our further analysis reveals the reason is that deep graph transformers are limited by the vanishing capacity of global attention, restricting the graph transformer from focusing on the critical substructure and obtaining expressive features. To this end, we propose a novel graph transformer model named DeepGraph that explicitly employs substructure tokens in the encoded representation, and applies local attention on related nodes to obtain substructure based attention encoding. Our model enhances the ability of the global attention to focus on substructures and promotes the expressiveness of the representations, addressing the limitation of self-attention as the graph transformer deepens. Experiments show that our method unblocks the depth limitation of graph transformers and results in state-of-the-art performance across various graph benchmarks with deeper models.</p></details> | ICLR 2023 |
| **[Relational Graph Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10960v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is a promising approach for building state-of-the-art predictive models on multi-table relational data by representing it as a heterogeneous temporal graph. However, commonly used Graph Neural Network models suffer from fundamental limitations in capturing complex structural patterns and long-range dependencies that are inherent in relational data. While Graph Transformers have emerged as powerful alternatives to GNNs on general graphs, applying them to relational entity graphs presents unique challenges: (i) Traditional positional encodings fail to generalize to massive, heterogeneous graphs; (ii) existing architectures cannot model the temporal dynamics and schema constraints of relational data; (iii) existing tokenization schemes lose critical structural information. Here we introduce the Relational Graph Transformer (RelGT), the first graph transformer architecture designed specifically for relational tables. RelGT employs a novel multi-element tokenization strategy that decomposes each node into five components (features, type, hop distance, time, and local structure), enabling efficient encoding of heterogeneity, temporality, and topology without expensive precomputation. Our architecture combines local attention over sampled subgraphs with global attention to learnable centroids, incorporating both local and database-wide representations. Across 21 tasks from the RelBench benchmark, RelGT consistently matches or outperforms GNN baselines by up to 18%, establishing Graph Transformers as a powerful architecture for Relational Deep Learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/snap-stanford/relgt</p></details> |

Attention Graphs aggregate attention matrices across Transformer layers and heads to describe how information flows among input nodes. Through experiments on homophilous and heterophilous node classification tasks, we analyze Attention Graphs from a network science perspective and find that: (1) When Graph Transformers are allowed to learn the optimal graph structure using all-to-all attention among input nodes, the Attention Graphs learned by the model do not tend to correlate with the input/original graph structure; and (2) For heterophilous graphs, different Graph Transformer variants can achieve similar performance while utilising distinct information flow patterns.

| **[Multi-dimensional Graph Fourier Transform](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07811v1)** | 2017-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many signals on Cartesian product graphs appear in the real world, such as digital images, sensor observation time series, and movie ratings on Netflix. These signals are "multi-dimensional" and have directional characteristics along each factor graph. However, the existing graph Fourier transform does not distinguish these directions, and assigns 1-D spectra to signals on product graphs. Further, these spectra are often multi-valued at some frequencies. Our main result is a multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform that solves such problems associated with the conventional GFT. Using algebraic properties of Cartesian products, the proposed transform rearranges 1-D spectra obtained by the conventional GFT into the multi-dimensional frequency domain, of which each dimension represents a directional frequency along each factor graph. Thus, the multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform enables directional frequency analysis, in addition to frequency analysis with the conventional GFT. Moreover, this rearrangement resolves the multi-valuedness of spectra in some cases. The multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform is a foundation of novel filterings and stationarities that utilize dimensional information of graph signals, which are also discussed in this study. The proposed methods are applicable to a wide variety of data that can be regarded as signals on Cartesian product graphs. This study also notes that multivariate graph signals can be regarded as 2-D univariate graph signals. This correspondence provides natural definitions of the multivariate graph Fourier transform and the multivariate stationarity based on their 2-D univariate versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Transformer Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.06455v2)** | 2020-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in representation learning on graphs and achieved state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as node classification and link prediction. However, most existing GNNs are designed to learn node representations on the fixed and homogeneous graphs. The limitations especially become problematic when learning representations on a misspecified graph or a heterogeneous graph that consists of various types of nodes and edges. In this paper, we propose Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) that are capable of generating new graph structures, which involve identifying useful connections between unconnected nodes on the original graph, while learning effective node representation on the new graphs in an end-to-end fashion. Graph Transformer layer, a core layer of GTNs, learns a soft selection of edge types and composite relations for generating useful multi-hop connections so-called meta-paths. Our experiments show that GTNs learn new graph structures, based on data and tasks without domain knowledge, and yield powerful node representation via convolution on the new graphs. Without domain-specific graph preprocessing, GTNs achieved the best performance in all three benchmark node classification tasks against the state-of-the-art methods that require pre-defined meta-paths from domain knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neura...</summary><p>Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2019</p></details> |

The transformer model implements a novel node encoding layer, replacing the position encoding typically used in transformers, to create a transformer with no position information that operates on graphs, encoding adjacent node properties into the edge generation process. The proposed model builds on graph generative work operating on graphs with edge features, creating a model that offers improved scalability with the number of nodes in a graph. In addition, our model is capable of learning a disentangled, interpretable latent space that represents graph properties through a mapping between latent variables and graph properties. In experiments we chose a benchmark task of molecular generation, given the importance of both generated node and edge features. Using the QM9 dataset we demonstrate that our model performs strongly across the task of generating valid, unique and novel molecules. Finally, we demonstrate that the model is interpretable by generating molecules controlled by molecular properties, and we then analyse and visualise the learned latent representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Graph...</summary><p>Graph Representation Learning and Beyond (GRL+) (ICML 2020)</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Transformer for Scalable Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.02866v2)** | 2023-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformer is gaining increasing attention in the field of machine learning and has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks for graph representation learning. However, as current implementations of Graph Transformer primarily focus on learning representations of small-scale graphs, the quadratic complexity of the global self-attention mechanism presents a challenge for full-batch training when applied to larger graphs. Additionally, conventional sampling-based methods fail to capture necessary high-level contextual information, resulting in a significant loss of performance. In this paper, we introduce the Hierarchical Scalable Graph Transformer (HSGT) as a solution to these challenges. HSGT successfully scales the Transformer architecture to node representation learning tasks on large-scale graphs, while maintaining high performance. By utilizing graph hierarchies constructed through coarsening techniques, HSGT efficiently updates and stores multi-scale information in node embeddings at different levels. Together with sampling-based training methods, HSGT effectively captures and aggregates multi-level information on the hierarchical graph using only Transformer blocks. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that HSGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale benchmarks with graphs containing millions of nodes with high efficiency.</p></details> | 11 pages; 3 figures |

Given a graph, we simply treat all nodes and edges as independent tokens, augment them with token embeddings, and feed them to a Transformer. With an appropriate choice of token embeddings, we prove that this approach is theoretically at least as expressive as an invariant graph network (2-IGN) composed of equivariant linear layers, which is already more expressive than all message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNN). When trained on a large-scale graph dataset (PCQM4Mv2), our method coined Tokenized Graph Transformer (TokenGT) achieves significantly better results compared to GNN baselines and competitive results compared to Transformer variants with sophisticated graph-specific inductive bias.

| **[Stability of Graph Scattering Transforms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04784v1)** | 2019-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scattering transforms are non-trainable deep convolutional architectures that exploit the multi-scale resolution of a wavelet filter bank to obtain an appropriate representation of data. More importantly, they are proven invariant to translations, and stable to perturbations that are close to translations. This stability property dons the scattering transform with a robustness to small changes in the metric domain of the data. When considering network data, regular convolutions do not hold since the data domain presents an irregular structure given by the network topology. In this work, we extend scattering transforms to network data by using multiresolution graph wavelets, whose computation can be obtained by means of graph convolutions. Furthermore, we prove that the resulting graph scattering transforms are stable to metric perturbations of the underlying network. This renders graph scattering transforms robust to changes on the network topology, making it particularly useful for cases of transfer learning, topology estimation or time-varying graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019)</p></details> |

Recent studies have proposed diverse architectures, enhanced explainability, and practical applications for Graph Transformers. In light of these rapid developments, we conduct a comprehensive review of Graph Transformers, covering aspects such as their architectures, theoretical foundations, and applications within this survey. We categorize the architecture of Graph Transformers according to their strategies for processing structural information, including graph tokenization, positional encoding, structure-aware attention and model ensemble. Furthermore, from the theoretical perspective, we examine the expressivity of Graph Transformers in various discussed architectures and contrast them with other advanced graph learning algorithms to discover the connections. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the practical applications where Graph Transformers have been utilized, such as molecule, protein, language, vision, traffic, brain and material data. At the end of this survey, we will discuss the current challenges and prospective directions in Graph Transformers for potential future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03747v1)** | 2023-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a challenging task, whose objective is to learn policies from static trajectory data without interacting with the environment. Recently, offline RL has been viewed as a sequence modeling problem, where an agent generates a sequence of subsequent actions based on a set of static transition experiences. However, existing approaches that use transformers to attend to all tokens naively can overlook the dependencies between different tokens and limit long-term dependency learning. In this paper, we propose the Graph Decision Transformer (GDT), a novel offline RL approach that models the input sequence into a causal graph to capture potential dependencies between fundamentally different concepts and facilitate temporal and causal relationship learning. GDT uses a graph transformer to process the graph inputs with relation-enhanced mechanisms, and an optional sequence transformer to handle fine-grained spatial information in visual tasks. Our experiments show that GDT matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art offline RL methods on image-based Atari and OpenAI Gym.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Graph Transformers for Large Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11109v1)** | 2023-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have recently emerged as powerful neural networks for graph learning, showcasing state-of-the-art performance on several graph property prediction tasks. However, these results have been limited to small-scale graphs, where the computational feasibility of the global attention mechanism is possible. The next goal is to scale up these architectures to handle very large graphs on the scale of millions or even billions of nodes. With large-scale graphs, global attention learning is proven impractical due to its quadratic complexity w.r.t. the number of nodes. On the other hand, neighborhood sampling techniques become essential to manage large graph sizes, yet finding the optimal trade-off between speed and accuracy with sampling techniques remains challenging. This work advances representation learning on single large-scale graphs with a focus on identifying model characteristics and critical design constraints for developing scalable graph transformer (GT) architectures. We argue such GT requires layers that can adeptly learn both local and global graph representations while swiftly sampling the graph topology. As such, a key innovation of this work lies in the creation of a fast neighborhood sampling technique coupled with a local attention mechanism that encompasses a 4-hop reception field, but achieved through just 2-hop operations. This local node embedding is then integrated with a global node embedding, acquired via another self-attention layer with an approximate global codebook, before finally sent through a downstream layer for node predictions. The proposed GT framework, named LargeGT, overcomes previous computational bottlenecks and is validated on three large-scale node classification benchmarks. We report a 3x speedup and 16.8% performance gain on ogbn-products and snap-patents, while we also scale LargeGT on ogbn-papers100M with a 5.9% performance improvement.</p></details> |  |

| **[AGFormer: Efficient Graph Representation with Anchor-Graph Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07521v1)** | 2023-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To alleviate the local receptive issue of GCN, Transformers have been exploited to capture the long range dependences of nodes for graph data representation and learning. However, existing graph Transformers generally employ regular self-attention module for all node-to-node message passing which needs to learn the affinities/relationships between all node's pairs, leading to high computational cost issue. Also, they are usually sensitive to graph noises. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel graph Transformer architecture, termed Anchor Graph Transformer (AGFormer), by leveraging an anchor graph model. To be specific, AGFormer first obtains some representative anchors and then converts node-to-node message passing into anchor-to-anchor and anchor-to-node message passing process. Thus, AGFormer performs much more efficiently and also robustly than regular node-to-node Transformers. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of proposed AGFormer.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we adapt the Laplacian pyramid transform for signals on Euclidean domains so that it can be used to analyze high-dimensional data residing on the vertices of a weighted graph. Our approach is to study existing methods and develop new methods for the four fundamental operations of graph downsampling, graph reduction, and filtering and interpolation of signals on graphs. Equipped with appropriate notions of these operations, we leverage the basic multiscale constructs and intuitions from classical signal processing to generate a transform that yields both a multiresolution of graphs and an associated multiresolution of a graph signal on the underlying sequence of graphs.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |

It's imperative to sort out the existing Transformer models for graphs and systematically investigate their effectiveness on various graph tasks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of various Graph Transformer models from the architectural design perspective. We first disassemble the existing models and conclude three typical ways to incorporate the graph information into the vanilla Transformer: 1) GNNs as Auxiliary Modules, 2) Improved Positional Embedding from Graphs, and 3) Improved Attention Matrix from Graphs. Furthermore, we implement the representative components in three groups and conduct a comprehensive comparison on various kinds of famous graph data benchmarks to investigate the real performance gain of each component.

| **[Graph Transformers without Positional Encodings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17791v3)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Transformers for graph representation learning have become increasingly popular, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a wide-variety of graph datasets, either alone or in combination with message-passing graph neural networks (MP-GNNs). Infusing graph inductive-biases in the innately structure-agnostic transformer architecture in the form of structural or positional encodings (PEs) is key to achieving these impressive results. However, designing such encodings is tricky and disparate attempts have been made to engineer such encodings including Laplacian eigenvectors, relative random-walk probabilities (RRWP), spatial encodings, centrality encodings, edge encodings etc. In this work, we argue that such encodings may not be required at all, provided the attention mechanism itself incorporates information about the graph structure. We introduce Eigenformer, a Graph Transformer employing a novel spectrum-aware attention mechanism cognizant of the Laplacian spectrum of the graph, and empirically show that it achieves performance competetive with SOTA Graph Transformers on a number of standard GNN benchmarks. Additionally, we theoretically prove that Eigenformer can express various graph structural connectivity matrices, which is particularly essential when learning over smaller graphs.</p></details> | Independent Research |
| **[Deep Prompt Tuning for Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10131v1)** | 2023-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph transformers have gained popularity in various graph-based tasks by addressing challenges faced by traditional Graph Neural Networks. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention operations and the extensive layering in graph transformer architectures present challenges when applying them to graph based prediction tasks. Fine-tuning, a common approach, is resource-intensive and requires storing multiple copies of large models. We propose a novel approach called deep graph prompt tuning as an alternative to fine-tuning for leveraging large graph transformer models in downstream graph based prediction tasks. Our method introduces trainable feature nodes to the graph and pre-pends task-specific tokens to the graph transformer, enhancing the model's expressive power. By freezing the pre-trained parameters and only updating the added tokens, our approach reduces the number of free parameters and eliminates the need for multiple model copies, making it suitable for small datasets and scalable to large graphs. Through extensive experiments on various-sized datasets, we demonstrate that deep graph prompt tuning achieves comparable or even superior performance to fine-tuning, despite utilizing significantly fewer task-specific parameters. Our contributions include the introduction of prompt tuning for graph transformers, its application to both graph transformers and message passing graph neural networks, improved efficiency and resource utilization, and compelling experimental results. This work brings attention to a promising approach to leverage pre-trained models in graph based prediction tasks and offers new opportunities for exploring and advancing graph representation learning.</p></details> |  |

The proposed graph-Transformer-based generator includes a novel graph Transformer encoder that combines graph convolutions and self-attentions in a Transformer to model both local and global interactions across connected and non-connected graph nodes. Specifically, the proposed connected node attention (CNA) and non-connected node attention (NNA) aim to capture the global relations across connected nodes and non-connected nodes in the input graph, respectively. The proposed graph modeling block (GMB) aims to exploit local vertex interactions based on a house layout topology. Moreover, we propose a new node classification-based discriminator to preserve the high-level semantic and discriminative node features for different house components. Finally, we propose a novel graph-based cycle-consistency loss that aims at maintaining the relative spatial relationships between ground truth and predicted graphs. Experiments on two challenging graph-constrained house generation tasks (i.e., house layout and roof generation) with two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GTGAN in terms of objective quantitative scores and subjective visual realism.

| **[FairGT: A Fairness-aware Graph Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17169v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of Graph Transformers (GTs) generally neglects considerations for fairness, resulting in biased outcomes against certain sensitive subgroups. Since GTs encode graph information without relying on message-passing mechanisms, conventional fairness-aware graph learning methods cannot be directly applicable to address these issues. To tackle this challenge, we propose FairGT, a Fairness-aware Graph Transformer explicitly crafted to mitigate fairness concerns inherent in GTs. FairGT incorporates a meticulous structural feature selection strategy and a multi-hop node feature integration method, ensuring independence of sensitive features and bolstering fairness considerations. These fairness-aware graph information encodings seamlessly integrate into the Transformer framework for downstream tasks. We also prove that the proposed fair structural topology encoding with adjacency matrix eigenvector selection and multi-hop integration are theoretically effective.

However, when it comes to the graph mining area, where graph neural network (GNN) has been the dominant paradigm, transformers haven't achieved competitive performance, especially on the node classification task. Existing graph transformer models typically adopt fully-connected attention mechanism on the whole input graph and thus suffer from severe scalability issues and are intractable to train in data insufficient cases. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel Gophormer model which applies transformers on ego-graphs instead of full-graphs. Specifically, Node2Seq module is proposed to sample ego-graphs as the input of transformers, which alleviates the challenge of scalability and serves as an effective data augmentation technique to boost model performance. Moreover, different from the feature-based attention strategy in vanilla transformers, we propose a proximity-enhanced attention mechanism to capture the fine-grained structural bias. In order to handle the uncertainty introduced by the ego-graph sampling, we further propose a consistency regularization and a multi-sample inference strategy for stabilized training and testing, respectively. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of Gophormer over existing graph transformers and popular GNNs, revealing the promising future of graph transformers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Transform Optimization with Application to Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06393v3)** | 2019-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new graph-based transform and illustrate its potential application to signal compression. Our approach relies on the careful design of a graph that optimizes the overall rate-distortion performance through an effective graph-based transform. We introduce a novel graph estimation algorithm, which uncovers the connectivities between the graph signal values by taking into consideration the coding of both the signal and the graph topology in rate-distortion terms. In particular, we introduce a novel coding solution for the graph by treating the edge weights as another graph signal that lies on the dual graph. Then, the cost of the graph description is introduced in the optimization problem by minimizing the sparsity of the coefficients of its graph Fourier transform (GFT) on the dual graph. In this way, we obtain a convex optimization problem whose solution defines an efficient transform coding strategy. The proposed technique is a general framework that can be applied to different types of signals, and we show two possible application fields, namely natural image coding and piecewise smooth image coding. The experimental results show that the proposed graph-based transform outperforms classical fixed transforms such as DCT for both natural and piecewise smooth images. In the case of depth map coding, the obtained results are even comparable to the state-of-the-art graph-based coding method, that are specifically designed for depth map images.</p></details> |  |

Graphlets are fundamental topology elements of all graphs/networks. They can be used as coding elements to encode graph-topological information at multiple granularity levels for classifying vertices on the same graph/network as well as for making differentiation or connection across different networks. Network/graph analysis using graphlets has growing applications. We recognize the universality and increased encoding capacity in using multiple graphlets, we address the arising computational complexity issues, and we present a fast method for exact graphlet transform. The fast graphlet transform establishes a few remarkable records at once in high computational efficiency, low memory consumption, and ready translation to high-performance program and implementation. It is intended to enable and advance network/graph analysis with graphlets, and to introduce the relatively new analysis apparatus to graph theory, high-performance graph computation, and broader applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Proceedings of High Performance Extreme Computing (HPEC) 2020</p></details> |

| **[Graph Transformer Networks: Learning Meta-path Graphs to Improve GNNs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06218v1)** | 2021-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to various fields due to their powerful representations of graph-structured data. Despite the success of GNNs, most existing GNNs are designed to learn node representations on the fixed and homogeneous graphs. The limitations especially become problematic when learning representations on a misspecified graph or a heterogeneous graph that consists of various types of nodes and edges. To address this limitations, we propose Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) that are capable of generating new graph structures, which preclude noisy connections and include useful connections (e.g., meta-paths) for tasks, while learning effective node representations on the new graphs in an end-to-end fashion. We further propose enhanced version of GTNs, Fast Graph Transformer Networks (FastGTNs), that improve scalability of graph transformations. Compared to GTNs, FastGTNs are 230x faster and use 100x less memory while allowing the identical graph transformations as GTNs. In addition, we extend graph transformations to the semantic proximity of nodes allowing non-local operations beyond meta-paths. Extensive experiments on both homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs show that GTNs and FastGTNs with non-local operations achieve the state-of-the-art performance for node classification tasks.

| **[GMTR: Graph Matching Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08141v2)** | 2023-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been used for visual matching beyond object detection and segmentation. However, the original grid dividing strategy of ViTs neglects the spatial information of the keypoints, limiting the sensitivity to local information. Therefore, we propose QueryTrans (Query Transformer), which adopts a cross-attention module and keypoints-based center crop strategy for better spatial information extraction. We further integrate the graph attention module and devise a transformer-based graph matching approach GMTR (Graph Matching TRansformers) whereby the combinatorial nature of GM is addressed by a graph transformer neural GM solver. On standard GM benchmarks, GMTR shows competitive performance against the SOTA frameworks. Specifically, on Pascal VOC, GMTR achieves $\mathbf{83.6\%}$ accuracy, $\mathbf{0.9\%}$ higher than the SOTA framework. On Spair-71k, GMTR shows great potential and outperforms most of the previous works. Meanwhile, on Pascal VOC, QueryTrans improves the accuracy of NGMv2 from $80.1\%$ to $\mathbf{83.3\%}$, and BBGM from $79.0\%$ to $\mathbf{84.5\%}$. On Spair-71k, QueryTrans improves NGMv2 from $80.6\%$ to $\mathbf{82.5\%}$, and BBGM from $82.1\%$ to $\mathbf{83.9\%}$. Source code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Structural Expressive Power of Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13987v1)** | 2023-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformer has recently received wide attention in the research community with its outstanding performance, yet its structural expressive power has not been well analyzed. Inspired by the connections between Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test and graph neural network (GNN), we introduce \textbf{SEG-WL test} (\textbf{S}tructural \textbf{E}ncoding enhanced \textbf{G}lobal \textbf{W}eisfeiler-\textbf{L}ehman test), a generalized graph isomorphism test algorithm as a powerful theoretical tool for exploring the structural discriminative power of graph Transformers. We theoretically prove that the SEG-WL test is an expressivity upper bound on a wide range of graph Transformers, and the representational power of SEG-WL test can be approximated by a simple Transformer network arbitrarily under certain conditions. With the SEG-WL test, we show how graph Transformers' expressive power is determined by the design of structural encodings, and present conditions that make the expressivity of graph Transformers beyond WL test and GNNs. Moreover, motivated by the popular shortest path distance encoding, we follow the theory-oriented principles and develop a provably stronger structural encoding method, Shortest Path Induced Subgraph (\textit{SPIS}) encoding. Our theoretical findings provide a novel and practical paradigm for investigating the expressive power of graph Transformers, and extensive synthetic and real-world experiments empirically verify the strengths of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Aware Transformer: Is Attention All Graphs Need?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05213v1)** | 2020-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are the natural data structure to represent relational and structural information in many domains. To cover the broad range of graph-data applications including graph classification as well as graph generation, it is desirable to have a general and flexible model consisting of an encoder and a decoder that can handle graph data. Although the representative encoder-decoder model, Transformer, shows superior performance in various tasks especially of natural language processing, it is not immediately available for graphs due to their non-sequential characteristics. To tackle this incompatibility, we propose GRaph-Aware Transformer (GRAT), the first Transformer-based model which can encode and decode whole graphs in end-to-end fashion. GRAT is featured with a self-attention mechanism adaptive to the edge information and an auto-regressive decoding mechanism based on the two-path approach consisting of sub-graph encoding path and node-and-edge generation path for each decoding step. We empirically evaluated GRAT on multiple setups including encoder-based tasks such as molecule property predictions on QM9 datasets and encoder-decoder-based tasks such as molecule graph generation in the organic molecule synthesis domain. GRAT has shown very promising results including state-of-the-art performance on 4 regression tasks in QM9 benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relphormer: Relational Graph Transformer for Knowledge Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10852v6)** | 2023-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have achieved remarkable performance in widespread fields, including natural language processing, computer vision and graph mining. However, vanilla Transformer architectures have not yielded promising improvements in the Knowledge Graph (KG) representations, where the translational distance paradigm dominates this area. Note that vanilla Transformer architectures struggle to capture the intrinsically heterogeneous structural and semantic information of knowledge graphs. To this end, we propose a new variant of Transformer for knowledge graph representations dubbed Relphormer. Specifically, we introduce Triple2Seq which can dynamically sample contextualized sub-graph sequences as the input to alleviate the heterogeneity issue. We propose a novel structure-enhanced self-attention mechanism to encode the relational information and keep the semantic information within entities and relations. Moreover, we utilize masked knowledge modeling for general knowledge graph representation learning, which can be applied to various KG-based tasks including knowledge graph completion, question answering, and recommendation. Experimental results on six datasets show that Relphormer can obtain better performance compared with baselines.

| **[Graph Consistency as a Graduated Property: Consistency-Sustaining and -Improving Graph Transformations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04162v2)** | 2021-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Where graphs are used for modelling and specifying systems, consistency is an important concern. To be a valid model of a system, the graph structure must satisfy a number of constraints. To date, consistency has primarily been viewed as a binary property: a graph either is or is not consistent with respect to a set of graph constraints. This has enabled the definition of notions such as constraint-preserving and constraint-guaranteeing graph transformations. Many practical applications - for example model repair or evolutionary search - implicitly assume a more graduated notion of consistency, but without an explicit formalisation only limited analysis of these applications is possible. In this paper, we introduce an explicit notion of consistency as a graduated property, depending on the number of constraint violations in a graph. We present two new characterisations of transformations (and transformation rules) enabling reasoning about the gradual introduction of consistency: while consistency-sustaining transformations do not decrease the consistency level, consistency-improving transformations strictly reduce the number of constraint violations. We show how these new definitions refine the existing concepts of constraint-preserving and constraint-guaranteeing transformations. To support a static analysis based on our characterisations, we present criteria for deciding which form of consistency ensuring transformations is induced by the application of a transformation rule. We illustrate our contributions in the context of an example from search-based model engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, accepted for publication at the International Conference on Graph Transformation 2020 Typos corrected, heading for Table 2 clarified, wrong statement in Theorem 2 omitted</p></details> |
| **[GiT: Graph Interactive Transformer for Vehicle Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05475v3)** | 2023-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers are more and more popular in computer vision, which treat an image as a sequence of patches and learn robust global features from the sequence. However, pure transformers are not entirely suitable for vehicle re-identification because vehicle re-identification requires both robust global features and discriminative local features. For that, a graph interactive transformer (GiT) is proposed in this paper. In the macro view, a list of GiT blocks are stacked to build a vehicle re-identification model, in where graphs are to extract discriminative local features within patches and transformers are to extract robust global features among patches. In the micro view, graphs and transformers are in an interactive status, bringing effective cooperation between local and global features. Specifically, one current graph is embedded after the former level's graph and transformer, while the current transform is embedded after the current graph and the former level's transformer. In addition to the interaction between graphs and transforms, the graph is a newly-designed local correction graph, which learns discriminative local features within a patch by exploring nodes' relationships. Extensive experiments on three large-scale vehicle re-identification datasets demonstrate that our GiT method is superior to state-of-the-art vehicle re-identification approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE TIP 2023</p></details> |

However, such models differ in their modeling approach, expressivity, serialization, and the nature of applications. RDF is the de-facto standard model for knowledge graphs on the Semantic Web and supported by a rich ecosystem for inference and processing. The property graph model, in contrast, provides advantages in scalable graph analytical tasks, such as graph matching, path analysis, and graph traversal. RDF-star extends RDF and allows capturing metadata as a first-class citizen. To tap on the advantages of alternative models, the literature proposes different ways of transforming knowledge graphs between property graphs and RDF. However, most of these approaches cannot provide complete transformations for RDF-star graphs. Hence, this paper provides a step towards transforming RDF-star graphs into property graphs. In particular, we identify different cases to evaluate transformation approaches from RDF-star to property graphs. Specifically, we categorize two classes of transformation approaches and analyze them based on the test cases. The obtained insights will form the foundation for building complete transformation approaches in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Conflict Detection for Graph Transformation with Attributes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.02614v1)** | 2015-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In graph transformation, a conflict describes a situation where two alternative transformations cannot be arbitrarily serialized. When enriching graphs with attributes, existing conflict detection techniques typically report a conflict whenever at least one of two transformations manipulates a shared attribute. In this paper, we propose an improved, less conservative condition for static conflict detection of graph transformation with attributes by explicitly taking the semantics of the attribute operations into account. The proposed technique is based on symbolic graphs, which extend the traditional notion of graphs by logic formulas used for attribute handling. The approach is proven complete, i.e., any potential conflict is guaranteed to be detected.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings GaM 2015, arXiv:1504.02448</p></details> |

The Transformer has access to information on the input graph only via the graph's incidence matrix. We present explicit weight configurations for implementing each algorithm, and we bound the constructed Transformers' errors by the errors of the underlying algorithms. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by experiments on synthetic data. Additionally, on a real-world molecular regression task, we observe that the linear Transformer is capable of learning a more effective positional encoding than the default one based on Laplacian eigenvectors. Our work is an initial step towards elucidating the inner-workings of the Transformer for graph data. Code is available at https://github.com/chengxiang/LinearGraphTransformer</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the Power of Transformer for Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.10581v1)** | 2022-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent successes in natural language processing and computer vision, Transformer suffers from the scalability problem when dealing with graphs. The computational complexity is unacceptable for large-scale graphs, e.g., knowledge graphs. One solution is to consider only the near neighbors, which, however, will lose the key merit of Transformer to attend to the elements at any distance. In this paper, we propose a new Transformer architecture, named dual-encoding Transformer (DET). DET has a structural encoder to aggregate information from connected neighbors and a semantic encoder to focus on semantically useful distant nodes. In comparison with resorting to multi-hop neighbors, DET seeks the desired distant neighbors via self-supervised training. We further find these two encoders can be incorporated to boost each others' performance. Our experiments demonstrate DET has achieved superior performance compared to the respective state-of-the-art methods in dealing with molecules, networks and knowledge graphs with various sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, under review</p></details> |
| **[Plain Transformers Can be Powerful Graph Learners](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12588v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities, owing to their simple but powerful scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph Transformers (GTs) have strayed far from plain Transformers, exhibiting major architectural differences either by integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention mechanisms. These divergences hinder the easy adoption of training advances for Transformers developed in other domains. Contrary to previous GTs, this work demonstrates that the plain Transformer architecture can be a powerful graph learner. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate three simple, minimal, and easy-to-implement modifications to the plain Transformer architecture to construct our Powerful Plain Graph Transformers (PPGT): (1) simplified $L_2$ attention for measuring the magnitude closeness among tokens; (2) adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude information; and (3) a simple MLP-based stem for graph positional encoding. Consistent with its theoretical expressivity, PPGT demonstrates noteworthy realized expressivity on the empirical graph expressivity benchmark, comparing favorably to more complicated competitors such as subgraph GNNs and higher-order GNNs. Its outstanding empirical performance across various graph datasets also justifies the practical effectiveness of PPGT.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we observe that existing graph Transformers treat nodes as independent tokens and construct a single long sequence composed of all node tokens so as to train the Transformer model, causing it hard to scale to large graphs due to the quadratic complexity on the number of nodes for the self-attention computation. To this end, we propose a Neighborhood Aggregation Graph Transformer (NAGphormer) that treats each node as a sequence containing a series of tokens constructed by our proposed Hop2Token module. For each node, Hop2Token aggregates the neighborhood features from different hops into different representations and thereby produces a sequence of token vectors as one input. In this way, NAGphormer could be trained in a mini-batch manner and thus could scale to large graphs. Moreover, we mathematically show that as compared to a category of advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the decoupled Graph Convolutional Network, NAGphormer could learn more informative node representations from the multi-hop neighborhoods. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets from small to large are conducted to demonstrate that NAGphormer consistently outperforms existing graph Transformers and mainstream GNNs.

Furthermore, the self-attention mechanism in transformers is prone to considering unnecessary global cues from unrelated objects or regions, introducing computational inefficiencies. In response to these challenges, we introduce the Key-Graph Transformer (KGT) in this paper. Specifically, KGT views patch features as graph nodes. The proposed Key-Graph Constructor efficiently forms a sparse yet representative Key-Graph by selectively connecting essential nodes instead of all the nodes. Then the proposed Key-Graph Attention is conducted under the guidance of the Key-Graph only among selected nodes with linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed KGT's state-of-the-art performance, showcasing advancements both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Confluence up to Garbage in Graph Transformation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01842v1)** | 2021-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transformation of graphs and graph-like structures is ubiquitous in computer science. When a system is described by graph-transformation rules, it is often desirable that the rules are both terminating and confluent so that rule applications in an arbitrary order produce unique resulting graphs. However, there are application scenarios where the rules are not globally confluent but confluent on a subclass of graphs that are of interest. In other words, non-resolvable conflicts can only occur on graphs that are considered as "garbage". In this paper, we introduce the notion of confluence up to garbage and generalise Plump's critical pair lemma for double-pushout graph transformation, providing a sufficient condition for confluence up to garbage by non-garbage critical pair analysis. We apply our results in two case studies about efficient language recognition: we present backtracking-free graph reduction systems which recognise a class of flow diagrams and a class of labelled series-parallel graphs, respectively. Both systems are non-confluent but confluent up to garbage. We also give a critical pair condition for subcommutativity up to garbage which, together with closedness, implies confluence up to garbage even in non-terminating systems.</p></details> | 33 pages, 2021 |

However, when it comes to graph-structured data, transformers have not achieved competitive performance, especially on large graphs. In this paper, we identify the main deficiencies of current graph transformers:(1) Existing node sampling strategies in Graph Transformers are agnostic to the graph characteristics and the training process. (2) Most sampling strategies only focus on local neighbors and neglect the long-range dependencies in the graph. We conduct experimental investigations on synthetic datasets to show that existing sampling strategies are sub-optimal. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we formulate the optimization strategies of node sampling in Graph Transformer as an adversary bandit problem, where the rewards are related to the attention weights and can vary in the training procedure. Meanwhile, we propose a hierarchical attention scheme with graph coarsening to capture the long-range interactions while reducing computational complexity. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing graph transformers and popular GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2022</p></details> |

| **[Comparing Graph Transformers via Positional Encodings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14202v4)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The distinguishing power of graph transformers is closely tied to the choice of positional encoding: features used to augment the base transformer with information about the graph. There are two primary types of positional encoding: absolute positional encodings (APEs) and relative positional encodings (RPEs). APEs assign features to each node and are given as input to the transformer. RPEs instead assign a feature to each pair of nodes, e.g., graph distance, and are used to augment the attention block. A priori, it is unclear which method is better for maximizing the power of the resulting graph transformer. In this paper, we aim to understand the relationship between these different types of positional encodings. Interestingly, we show that graph transformers using APEs and RPEs are equivalent in terms of distinguishing power. In particular, we demonstrate how to interchange APEs and RPEs while maintaining their distinguishing power in terms of graph transformers. Based on our theoretical results, we provide a study on several APEs and RPEs (including the resistance distance and the recently introduced stable and expressive positional encoding (SPE)) and compare their distinguishing power in terms of transformers. We believe our work will help navigate the huge number of choices of positional encoding and will provide guidance on the future design of positional encodings for graph transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> |

Unfortunately, Graph Transformers are computationally expensive due to the quadratic complexity inherent in self-attention when applied over large-scale graphs, especially for node tasks. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs), with event-driven and binary spikes properties, can perform energy-efficient computation. In this work, we propose a novel insight into integrating SNNs with Graph Transformers and design a Spiking Graph Attention (SGA) module. The matrix multiplication is replaced by sparse addition and mask operations. The linear complexity enables all-pair node interactions on large-scale graphs with limited GPU memory. To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to introduce SNNs into Graph Transformers. Furthermore, we design SpikeGraphormer, a Dual-branch architecture, combining a sparse GNN branch with our SGA-driven Graph Transformer branch, which can simultaneously perform all-pair node interactions and capture local neighborhoods. SpikeGraphormer consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across various datasets and makes substantial improvements in training time, inference time, and GPU memory cost (10 ~ 20x lower than vanilla self-attention). It also performs well in cross-domain applications (image and text classification). We release our code at https://github.com/PHD-lanyu/SpikeGraphormer.</p></details> |  |

Since the transformer's original sinusoidal positional encodings (PEs) are not applicable to graphs, recent work has focused on developing graph PEs, rooted in spectral graph theory or various spatial features of a graph. In this work, we introduce a new graph PE, Graph Automaton PE (GAPE), based on weighted graph-walking automata (a novel extension of graph-walking automata). We compare the performance of GAPE with other PE schemes on both machine translation and graph-structured tasks, and we show that it generalizes several other PEs.

Many NP-hard graph problems allow polynomial-time solutions, when restricted to graphs of bounded tree-width or bounded path-width. In this work, we study the behavior of tree-width and path-width under various unary and binary graph transformations. Doing so, for considered transformations we provide upper and lower bounds for the tree-width and path-width of the resulting graph in terms of the tree-width and path-width of the initial graphs or argue why such bounds are impossible to specify. Among the studied, unary transformations are vertex addition, vertex deletion, edge addition, edge deletion, subgraphs, vertex identification, edge contraction, edge subdivision, minors, powers of graphs, line graphs, edge complements, local complements, Seidel switching, and Seidel complementation. Among the studied, binary transformations we consider the disjoint union, join, union, substitution, graph product, 1-sum, and corona of two graphs.</p></details> | 34 pages |

However, incorporating graph inductive bias into transformer architectures remains a significant challenge. In this report, we propose the Graph Spectral Token, a novel approach to directly encode graph spectral information, which captures the global structure of the graph, into the transformer architecture. By parameterizing the auxiliary [CLS] token and leaving other tokens representing graph nodes, our method seamlessly integrates spectral information into the learning process. We benchmark the effectiveness of our approach by enhancing two existing graph transformers, GraphTrans and SubFormer. The improved GraphTrans, dubbed GraphTrans-Spec, achieves over 10% improvements on large graph benchmark datasets while maintaining efficiency comparable to MP-GNNs. SubFormer-Spec demonstrates strong performance across various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

To understand this inadequacy, there is a need to investigate if spectral analysis of the transformer will reveal insights into its expressive power. Similar studies already established that spectral analysis of Graph neural networks (GNNs) provides extra perspectives on their expressiveness. In this work, we systematically study and establish the link between the spatial and spectral domain in the realm of the transformer. We further provide a theoretical analysis and prove that the spatial attention mechanism in the transformer cannot effectively capture the desired frequency response, thus, inherently limiting its expressiveness in spectral space. Therefore, we propose FeTA, a framework that aims to perform attention over the entire graph spectrum (i.e., actual frequency components of the graphs) analogous to the attention in spatial space. Empirical results suggest that FeTA provides homogeneous performance gain against vanilla transformer across all tasks on standard benchmarks and can easily be extended to GNN-based models with low-pass characteristics (e.g., GAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Graph Transformers with Hierarchical Distance Structural Encoding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11129v4)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph transformers need strong inductive biases to derive meaningful attention scores. Yet, current methods often fall short in capturing longer ranges, hierarchical structures, or community structures, which are common in various graphs such as molecules, social networks, and citation networks. This paper presents a Hierarchical Distance Structural Encoding (HDSE) method to model node distances in a graph, focusing on its multi-level, hierarchical nature. We introduce a novel framework to seamlessly integrate HDSE into the attention mechanism of existing graph transformers, allowing for simultaneous application with other positional encodings. To apply graph transformers with HDSE to large-scale graphs, we further propose a high-level HDSE that effectively biases the linear transformers towards graph hierarchies. We theoretically prove the superiority of HDSE over shortest path distances in terms of expressivity and generalization. Empirically, we demonstrate that graph transformers with HDSE excel in graph classification, regression on 7 graph-level datasets, and node classification on 11 large-scale graphs, including those with up to a billion nodes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain Generalization Deep Graph Transformation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11389v2)** | 2023-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph transformation that predicts graph transition from one mode to another is an important and common problem. Despite much progress in developing advanced graph transformation techniques in recent years, the fundamental assumption typically required in machine-learning models that the testing and training data preserve the same distribution does not always hold. As a result, domain generalization graph transformation that predicts graphs not available in the training data is under-explored, with multiple key challenges to be addressed including (1) the extreme space complexity when training on all input-output mode combinations, (2) difference of graph topologies between the input and the output modes, and (3) how to generalize the model to (unseen) target domains that are not in the training data. To fill the gap, we propose a multi-input, multi-output, hypernetwork-based graph neural network (MultiHyperGNN) that employs a encoder and a decoder to encode topologies of both input and output modes and semi-supervised link prediction to enhance the graph transformation task. Instead of training on all mode combinations, MultiHyperGNN preserves a constant space complexity with the encoder and the decoder produced by two novel hypernetworks. Comprehensive experiments show that MultiHyperGNN has a superior performance than competing models in both prediction and domain generalization tasks.</p></details> |  |

Our first contribution is to propose a generic, complex-valued spectral graph architecture obtained from a generalization of the Euclidean Fourier transform. We show that our learned representation consists of both discriminative and invariant features, thanks to a novel greedy concave objective. From our experiments, we conclude that our learning procedure exploits the topology of the spectral domain, which is normally a flaw of spectral methods, and in particular our method can recover an analytic operator for vision tasks. We test our algorithm on various and challenging tasks such as image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10), community detection (Authorship, Facebook graph) and action recognition from 3D skeletons videos (SBU, NTU), exhibiting a new state-of-the-art in spectral graph unsupervised settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Embedding in the Graph Fractional Fourier Transform Domain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02383v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral graph embedding plays a critical role in graph representation learning by generating low-dimensional vector representations from graph spectral information. However, the embedding space of traditional spectral embedding methods often exhibit limited expressiveness, failing to exhaustively capture latent structural features across alternative transform domains. To address this issue, we use the graph fractional Fourier transform to extend the existing state-of-the-art generalized frequency filtering embedding (GEFFE) into fractional domains, giving birth to the generalized fractional filtering embedding (GEFRFE), which enhances embedding informativeness via the graph fractional domain. The GEFRFE leverages graph fractional domain filtering and a nonlinear composition of eigenvector components derived from a fractionalized graph Laplacian. To dynamically determine the fractional order, two parallel strategies are introduced: search-based optimization and a ResNet18-based adaptive learning. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the GEFRFE captures richer structural features and significantly enhance classification performance. Notably, the proposed method retains computational complexity comparable to GEFFE approaches.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate that Transformers can generalize well to 3D atomistic graphs and present Equiformer, a graph neural network leveraging the strength of Transformer architectures and incorporating SE(3)/E(3)-equivariant features based on irreducible representations (irreps). First, we propose a simple and effective architecture by only replacing original operations in Transformers with their equivariant counterparts and including tensor products. Using equivariant operations enables encoding equivariant information in channels of irreps features without complicating graph structures. With minimal modifications to Transformers, this architecture has already achieved strong empirical results. Second, we propose a novel attention mechanism called equivariant graph attention, which improves upon typical attention in Transformers through replacing dot product attention with multi-layer perceptron attention and including non-linear message passing. With these two innovations, Equiformer achieves competitive results to previous models on QM9, MD17 and OC20 datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Graph Transformer for Multimodal Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.00581v1)** | 2023-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Transformer models in vision and language tasks, they often learn knowledge from enormous data implicitly and cannot utilize structured input data directly. On the other hand, structured learning approaches such as graph neural networks (GNNs) that integrate prior information can barely compete with Transformer models. In this work, we aim to benefit from both worlds and propose a novel Multimodal Graph Transformer for question answering tasks that requires performing reasoning across multiple modalities. We introduce a graph-involved plug-and-play quasi-attention mechanism to incorporate multimodal graph information, acquired from text and visual data, to the vanilla self-attention as effective prior. In particular, we construct the text graph, dense region graph, and semantic graph to generate adjacency matrices, and then compose them with input vision and language features to perform downstream reasoning. Such a way of regularizing self-attention with graph information significantly improves the inferring ability and helps align features from different modalities. We validate the effectiveness of Multimodal Graph Transformer over its Transformer baselines on GQA, VQAv2, and MultiModalQA datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Fourier transforms on directed product graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.01336v2)** | 2022-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Fourier transform (GFT) is one of the fundamental tools in graph signal processing to decompose graph signals into different frequency components and to represent graph signals with strong correlation by different modes of variation effectively. The GFT on undirected graphs has been well studied and several approaches have been proposed to define GFTs on directed graphs. In this paper, based on the singular value decompositions of some graph Laplacians, we propose two GFTs on the Cartesian product graph of two directed graphs. We show that the proposed GFTs could represent spatial-temporal data sets on directed networks with strong correlation efficiently, and in the undirected graph setting they are essentially the joint GFT in the literature. In this paper, we also consider the bandlimiting procedure in the spectral domain of the proposed GFTs, and demonstrate its performance to denoise the temperature data set in the region of Brest (France) on January 2014.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformers Meet Directed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.00049v3)** | 2023-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers were originally proposed as a sequence-to-sequence model for text but have become vital for a wide range of modalities, including images, audio, video, and undirected graphs. However, transformers for directed graphs are a surprisingly underexplored topic, despite their applicability to ubiquitous domains, including source code and logic circuits. In this work, we propose two direction- and structure-aware positional encodings for directed graphs: (1) the eigenvectors of the Magnetic Laplacian - a direction-aware generalization of the combinatorial Laplacian; (2) directional random walk encodings. Empirically, we show that the extra directionality information is useful in various downstream tasks, including correctness testing of sorting networks and source code understanding. Together with a data-flow-centric graph construction, our model outperforms the prior state of the art on the Open Graph Benchmark Code2 relatively by 14.7%.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Using weakest application conditions to rank graph transformations for graph repair](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08788v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When using graphs and graph transformations to model systems, consistency is an important concern. While consistency has primarily been viewed as a binary property, i.e., a graph is consistent or inconsistent with respect to a set of constraints, recent work has presented an approach to consistency as a graduated property. This allows living with inconsistencies for a while and repairing them when necessary. For repairing inconsistencies in a graph, we use graph transformation rules with so-called {\em impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions} to understand how much repair gain certain rule applications would bring. Both types of conditions can be derived from given graph constraints. Our main theorem shows that the difference between the number of actual constraint violations before and after a graph transformation step can be characterized by the difference between the numbers of violated impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions. This theory forms the basis for algorithms with look-ahead that rank graph transformations according to their potential for graph repair. An evaluation shows that graph repair can be well supported by rules with these new types of application conditions in terms of effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 25 Figures, new, more efficient method for constructing application conditions, theoretical comparison to other concepts of consistency, extended evaluation</p></details> |

| **[NTFormer: A Composite Node Tokenized Graph Transformer for Node Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19249v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the emerging graph Transformers have made significant advancements for node classification on graphs. In most graph Transformers, a crucial step involves transforming the input graph into token sequences as the model input, enabling Transformer to effectively learn the node representations. However, we observe that existing methods only express partial graph information of nodes through single-type token generation. Consequently, they require tailored strategies to encode additional graph-specific features into the Transformer to ensure the quality of node representation learning, limiting the model flexibility to handle diverse graphs. To this end, we propose a new graph Transformer called NTFormer to address this issue. NTFormer introduces a novel token generator called Node2Par, which constructs various token sequences using different token elements for each node. This flexibility allows Node2Par to generate valuable token sequences from different perspectives, ensuring comprehensive expression of rich graph features. Benefiting from the merits of Node2Par, NTFormer only leverages a Transformer-based backbone without graph-specific modifications to learn node representations, eliminating the need for graph-specific modifications. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets containing homophily and heterophily graphs with different scales demonstrate the superiority of NTFormer over representative graph Transformers and graph neural networks for node classification.</p></details> |  |

Graph inductive biases are crucial for Graph Transformers, and previous works incorporate them using message-passing modules and/or positional encodings. However, Graph Transformers that use message-passing inherit known issues of message-passing, and differ significantly from Transformers used in other domains, thus making transfer of research advances more difficult. On the other hand, Graph Transformers without message-passing often perform poorly on smaller datasets, where inductive biases are more crucial. To bridge this gap, we propose the Graph Inductive bias Transformer (GRIT) -- a new Graph Transformer that incorporates graph inductive biases without using message passing. GRIT is based on several architectural changes that are each theoretically and empirically justified, including: learned relative positional encodings initialized with random walk probabilities, a flexible attention mechanism that updates node and node-pair representations, and injection of degree information in each layer. We prove that GRIT is expressive -- it can express shortest path distances and various graph propagation matrices. GRIT achieves state-of-the-art empirical performance across a variety of graph datasets, thus showing the power that Graph Transformers without message-passing can deliver.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICML 2023; 17 pages</p></details> |

However, most GNNs are designed for homogeneous graphs, in which all nodes and edges belong to the same types, making them infeasible to represent heterogeneous structures. In this paper, we present the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) architecture for modeling Web-scale heterogeneous graphs. To model heterogeneity, we design node- and edge-type dependent parameters to characterize the heterogeneous attention over each edge, empowering HGT to maintain dedicated representations for different types of nodes and edges. To handle dynamic heterogeneous graphs, we introduce the relative temporal encoding technique into HGT, which is able to capture the dynamic structural dependency with arbitrary durations. To handle Web-scale graph data, we design the heterogeneous mini-batch graph sampling algorithm---HGSampling---for efficient and scalable training. Extensive experiments on the Open Academic Graph of 179 million nodes and 2 billion edges show that the proposed HGT model consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art GNN baselines by 9%--21% on various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on WWW 2020</p></details> |

However, in a dynamic context, by interconnecting all nodes at multiple snapshots with self-attention, GT loose both structural and temporal information. In this work, we introduce Supra-LAplacian encoding for spatio-temporal TransformErs (SLATE), a new spatio-temporal encoding to leverage the GT architecture while keeping spatio-temporal information. Specifically, we transform Discrete Time Dynamic Graphs into multi-layer graphs and take advantage of the spectral properties of their associated supra-Laplacian matrix. Our second contribution explicitly model nodes' pairwise relationships with a cross-attention mechanism, providing an accurate edge representation for dynamic link prediction. SLATE outperforms numerous state-of-the-art methods based on Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks combined with recurrent models (e.g LSTM), and Dynamic Graph Transformers, on 9 datasets.

| **[Graph External Attention Enhanced Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.21061v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Transformer architecture has recently gained considerable attention in the field of graph representation learning, as it naturally overcomes several limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with customized attention mechanisms or positional and structural encodings. Despite making some progress, existing works tend to overlook external information of graphs, specifically the correlation between graphs. Intuitively, graphs with similar structures should have similar representations. Therefore, we propose Graph External Attention (GEA) -- a novel attention mechanism that leverages multiple external node/edge key-value units to capture inter-graph correlations implicitly. On this basis, we design an effective architecture called Graph External Attention Enhanced Transformer (GEAET), which integrates local structure and global interaction information for more comprehensive graph representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GEAET achieves state-of-the-art empirical performance.

Inspired by discrete signal processing, where embedding a line digraph into a cycle digraph facilitates the powerful Discrete Fourier Transform for signal analysis, addressing the structural complexities of general digraphs can help overcome the limitations of the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) and unlock its potential. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) serves as a Graph Fourier Transform for both cycle graphs and Cayley digraphs on the finite cyclic groups $\mathbb{Z}_N$. We propose a systematic method to identify a class of such Cayley digraphs that can encompass a given directed graph. By embedding the directed graph into these Cayley digraphs and opting for envelope extensions that naturally support the Graph Fourier Transform, the GFT functionalities of these extensions can be harnessed for signal analysis. Among the potential envelopes, optimal performance is achieved by selecting one that meets key properties. This envelope's structure closely aligns with the characteristics of the original digraph. The Graph Fourier Transform of this envelope is reliable in terms of numerical stability, and its columns approximately form an eigenbasis for the adjacency matrix associated with the original digraph. It is shown that the envelope extensions possess a convolution product, with their GFT fulfilling the convolution theorem. Additionally, shift-invariant graph filters (systems) are described as the convolution operator, analogous to the classical case. This allows the utilization of systems for signal analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 16 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Transformers Can Learn Connectivity in Some Graphs but Not Others](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22343v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the responses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust reasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as causal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g., knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input prompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like'' directed graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of transformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components, transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the number of components is large.</p></details> | Under Review |

Graph transformation is a model for dynamic systems with a large variety of applications. We introduce a novel method of the graph transformation model construction, combining generative and dynamical viewpoints to give a fully automated data-driven model inference method. The method takes the input dynamical properties, given as a "snapshot" of the dynamics encoded by explicit transitions, and constructs a compatible model. The obtained model is guaranteed to be minimal, thus framing the approach as model compression (from a set of transitions into a set of rules). The compression is permissive to a lossy case, where the constructed model is allowed to exhibit behavior outside of the input transitions, thus suggesting a completion of the input dynamics. The task of graph transformation model inference is naturally highly challenging due to the combinatorics involved. We tackle the exponential explosion by proposing a heuristically minimal translation of the task into a well-established problem, set cover, for which highly optimized solutions exist. We further showcase how our results relate to Kolmogorov complexity expressed in terms of graph transformation.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, little research has been conducted on error detection of LLM responses. Collecting error annotations on LLM responses is challenging due to the subjective nature of many NLP tasks, and thus previous research focuses on tasks of little practical value (e.g., word sorting) or limited error types (e.g., faithfulness in summarization). This work introduces ReaLMistake, the first error detection benchmark consisting of objective, realistic, and diverse errors made by LLMs. ReaLMistake contains three challenging and meaningful tasks that introduce objectively assessable errors in four categories (reasoning correctness, instruction-following, context-faithfulness, and parameterized knowledge), eliciting naturally observed and diverse errors in responses of GPT-4 and Llama 2 70B annotated by experts. We use ReaLMistake to evaluate error detectors based on 12 LLMs. Our findings show: 1) Top LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude 3 detect errors made by LLMs at very low recall, and all LLM-based error detectors perform much worse than humans. 2) Explanations by LLM-based error detectors lack reliability. 3) LLMs-based error detection is sensitive to small changes in prompts but remains challenging to improve. 4) Popular approaches to improving LLMs, including self-consistency and majority vote, do not improve the error detection performance. Our benchmark and code are provided at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/ReaLMistake.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM 2024, 46 pages, Benchmark and code: https://github.com/psunlpgroup/ReaLMistake</p></details> |

We introduce LLM Chemistry -- a framework that measures when LLM combinations exhibit synergistic or antagonistic behaviors that shape collective performance beyond individual capabilities. We formalize the notion of chemistry among LLMs, propose algorithms that quantify it by analyzing interaction dependencies, and recommend optimal model ensembles accordingly. Our theoretical analysis shows that chemistry among collaborating LLMs is most evident under heterogeneous model profiles, with its outcome impact shaped by task type, group size, and complexity. Evaluation on classification, summarization, and program repair tasks provides initial evidence for these task-dependent effects, thereby reinforcing our theoretical results. This establishes LLM Chemistry as both a diagnostic factor in multi-LLM systems and a foundation for ensemble recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Intrigued by the claims of emergent planning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), works have been proposed to investigate the planning effectiveness of LLMs, without considering any utilization of off-the-shelf planning techniques in LLMs. In this paper, we aim to further study the insight of the planning capability of LLMs by investigating the roles of LLMs in off-the-shelf planning frameworks. To do this, we investigate the effectiveness of embedding LLMs into one of the well-known planning frameworks, graph-based planning, proposing a novel LLMs-based planning framework with LLMs embedded in two levels of planning graphs, i.e., mutual constraints generation level and constraints solving level. We empirically exhibit the effectiveness of our proposed framework in various planning domains.</p></details> |  |

However, users with data privacy concerns face limitations in directly utilizing LLM APIs, while private deployments incur significant computational demands. This creates a substantial challenge in achieving secure LLM adaptation under constrained local resources. To address this issue, collaborative learning methods, such as Split Learning (SL), offer a resource-efficient and privacy-preserving solution for adapting LLMs to private domains. In this study, we introduce VFLAIR-LLM (available at https://github.com/FLAIR-THU/VFLAIR-LLM), an extensible and lightweight split learning framework for LLMs, enabling privacy-preserving LLM inference and fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Our library provides two LLM partition settings, supporting three task types and 18 datasets. In addition, we provide standard modules for implementing and evaluating attacks and defenses. We benchmark 5 attacks and 9 defenses under various Split Learning for LLM(SL-LLM) settings, offering concrete insights and recommendations on the choice of model partition configurations, defense strategies, and relevant hyperparameters for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, published in KDD2025</p></details> |
| **[When One LLM Drools, Multi-LLM Collaboration Rules](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04506v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This position paper argues that in many realistic (i.e., complex, contextualized, subjective) scenarios, one LLM is not enough to produce a reliable output. We challenge the status quo of relying solely on a single general-purpose LLM and argue for multi-LLM collaboration to better represent the extensive diversity of data, skills, and people. We first posit that a single LLM underrepresents real-world data distributions, heterogeneous skills, and pluralistic populations, and that such representation gaps cannot be trivially patched by further training a single LLM. We then organize existing multi-LLM collaboration methods into a hierarchy, based on the level of access and information exchange, ranging from API-level, text-level, logit-level, to weight-level collaboration. Based on these methods, we highlight how multi-LLM collaboration addresses challenges that a single LLM struggles with, such as reliability, democratization, and pluralism. Finally, we identify the limitations of existing multi-LLM methods and motivate future work. We envision multi-LLM collaboration as an essential path toward compositional intelligence and collaborative AI development.</p></details> |  |

The performance of an LLM inference service is largely determined by the hardware onto which it is deployed, but understanding of which hardware will deliver on performance requirements remains challenging. In this work we present LLM-Pilot - a first-of-its-kind system for characterizing and predicting performance of LLM inference services. LLM-Pilot performs benchmarking of LLM inference services, under a realistic workload, across a variety of GPUs, and optimizes the service configuration for each considered GPU to maximize performance. Finally, using this characterization data, LLM-Pilot learns a predictive model, which can be used to recommend the most cost-effective hardware for a previously unseen LLM. Compared to existing methods, LLM-Pilot can deliver on performance requirements 33% more frequently, whilst reducing costs by 60% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC '24)</p></details> |

One of the most promising applications is their role as evaluators based on natural language responses, referred to as ''LLMs-as-judges''. This framework has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry due to their excellent effectiveness, ability to generalize across tasks, and interpretability in the form of natural language. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the LLMs-as-judges paradigm from five key perspectives: Functionality, Methodology, Applications, Meta-evaluation, and Limitations. We begin by providing a systematic definition of LLMs-as-Judges and introduce their functionality (Why use LLM judges?). Then we address methodology to construct an evaluation system with LLMs (How to use LLM judges?). Additionally, we investigate the potential domains for their application (Where to use LLM judges?) and discuss methods for evaluating them in various contexts (How to evaluate LLM judges?). Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of LLM judges and discuss potential future directions. Through a structured and comprehensive analysis, we aim aims to provide insights on the development and application of LLMs-as-judges in both research and practice. We will continue to maintain the relevant resource list at https://github.com/CSHaitao/Awesome-LLMs-as-Judges.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, comprehensive and continuously updated</p></details> |

Sketches, as compact data structures that offer low memory overhead with bounded accuracy, have emerged as a promising solution for network stream mining. Recent studies attempt to optimize sketches using machine learning; however, these approaches face the challenges of lacking adaptivity to dynamic networks and incurring high training costs. In this paper, we propose LLM-Sketch, based on the insight that fields beyond the flow IDs in packet headers can also help infer flow sizes. By using a two-tier data structure and separately recording large and small flows, LLM-Sketch improves accuracy while minimizing memory usage. Furthermore, it leverages fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to reliably estimate flow sizes. We evaluate LLM-Sketch on three representative tasks, and the results demonstrate that LLM-Sketch outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a $7.5\times$ accuracy improvement.</p></details> |  |

Indeed, recent research has shown that LLMs are capable of solving the majority of the assignments and exams we previously used in CS1. In addition, professional software engineers are often using these tools, raising the question of whether we should be training our students in their use as well. This experience report describes a CS1 course at a large research-intensive university that fully embraces the use of LLMs from the beginning of the course. To incorporate the LLMs, the course was intentionally altered to reduce emphasis on syntax and writing code from scratch. Instead, the course now emphasizes skills needed to successfully produce software with an LLM. This includes explaining code, testing code, and decomposing large problems into small functions that are solvable by an LLM. In addition to frequent, formative assessments of these skills, students were given three large, open-ended projects in three separate domains (data science, image processing, and game design) that allowed them to showcase their creativity in topics of their choosing. In an end-of-term survey, students reported that they appreciated learning with the assistance of the LLM and that they interacted with the LLM in a variety of ways when writing code. We provide lessons learned for instructors who may wish to incorporate LLMs into their course.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in Proceedings of the 29th ACM conference on innovation and technology in computer science education (ITiCSE)</p></details> |

With large language models (LLMs) crossing critical reliability thresholds for a growing slate of capabilities, there is an increasing effort to decompose systems into sets of LLM-based agents, each of whom can be delegated sub-tasks. However, this decomposition (even when automated) is often intuitive, e.g., based on how a human might assign roles to members of a human team. How close are these role decompositions to optimal? This position paper argues that asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives is needed to reason about the efficiency of such decomposed systems, and that insights from such analysis will unlock opportunities for scaling them. By treating the LLM forward pass as the atomic unit of computational cost, one can separate out the (often opaque) inner workings of a particular LLM from the inherent efficiency of how a set of LLMs are orchestrated to solve hard problems. In other words, if we want to scale the deployment of LLMs to the limit, instead of anthropomorphizing LLMs, asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives should be used to reason about and develop more powerful decompositions of large problems into LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025); 13 pages including references</p></details> |
| **[Set-LLM: A Permutation-Invariant LLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15433v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across numerous applications, their robustness remains a critical concern. This paper is motivated by a specific vulnerability: the order sensitivity of LLMs. This vulnerability manifests itself as the order bias observed when LLMs decide between possible options (for example, a preference for the first option) and the tendency of LLMs to provide different answers when options are reordered. The use cases for this scenario extend beyond the classical case of multiple-choice question answering to the use of LLMs as automated evaluators in AI pipelines, comparing output generated by different models. We introduce Set-LLM, a novel architectural adaptation for pretrained LLMs that enables the processing of mixed set-text inputs with permutation invariance guarantees. The adaptations involve a new attention mask and new positional encodings specifically designed for sets. We provide a theoretical proof of invariance and demonstrate through experiments that Set-LLM can be trained effectively, achieving comparable or improved performance and maintaining the runtime of the original model, while eliminating order sensitivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can You Trust LLM Judgments? Reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12509v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, but their stochastic nature poses challenges to the reliability of their outputs. While deterministic settings can improve consistency, they do not guarantee reliability, as a single sample from the model's probability distribution can still be misleading. Building upon the concept of LLM-as-a-judge, we introduce a novel framework for rigorously evaluating the reliability of LLM judgments, leveraging McDonald's omega. We evaluate the reliability of LLMs when judging the outputs of other LLMs on standard single-turn and multi-turn benchmarks, simultaneously investigating the impact of temperature on reliability. By analyzing these results, we demonstrate the limitations of fixed randomness and the importance of considering multiple samples, which we show has significant implications for downstream applications. Our findings highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of LLM reliability and the potential risks associated with over-reliance on single-shot evaluations. This work provides a crucial step towards building more trustworthy and reliable LLM-based systems and applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let the LLMs Talk: Simulating Human-to-Human Conversational QA via Zero-Shot LLM-to-LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02913v1)** | 2023-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational question-answering (CQA) systems aim to create interactive search systems that effectively retrieve information by interacting with users. To replicate human-to-human conversations, existing work uses human annotators to play the roles of the questioner (student) and the answerer (teacher). Despite its effectiveness, challenges exist as human annotation is time-consuming, inconsistent, and not scalable. To address this issue and investigate the applicability of large language models (LLMs) in CQA simulation, we propose a simulation framework that employs zero-shot learner LLMs for simulating teacher-student interactions. Our framework involves two LLMs interacting on a specific topic, with the first LLM acting as a student, generating questions to explore a given search topic. The second LLM plays the role of a teacher by answering questions and is equipped with additional information, including a text on the given topic. We implement both the student and teacher by zero-shot prompting the GPT-4 model. To assess the effectiveness of LLMs in simulating CQA interactions and understand the disparities between LLM- and human-generated conversations, we evaluate the simulated data from various perspectives. We begin by evaluating the teacher's performance through both automatic and human assessment. Next, we evaluate the performance of the student, analyzing and comparing the disparities between questions generated by the LLM and those generated by humans. Furthermore, we conduct extensive analyses to thoroughly examine the LLM performance by benchmarking state-of-the-art reading comprehension models on both datasets. Our results reveal that the teacher LLM generates lengthier answers that tend to be more accurate and complete. The student LLM generates more diverse questions, covering more aspects of a given topic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WSDM 2024</p></details> |

Guidelines provided by ISO and NIST aim to govern AI risk management; however, practical implementations remain scarce in scholarly works. Addressing this void, our research explores risks emanating from downstream uses of large language models (LLMs), synthesizing a taxonomy grounded in earlier research. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a novel LLM-based risk assessment engine (GUARD-D-LLM: Guided Understanding and Assessment for Risk Detection for Downstream use of LLMs) designed to pinpoint and rank threats relevant to specific use cases derived from text-based user inputs. Integrating thirty intelligent agents, this innovative approach identifies bespoke risks, gauges their severity, offers targeted suggestions for mitigation, and facilitates risk-aware development. The paper also documents the limitations of such an approach along with way forward suggestions to augment experts in such risk assessment thereby leveraging GUARD-D-LLM in identifying risks early on and enabling early mitigations. This paper and its associated code serve as a valuable resource for developers seeking to mitigate risks associated with LLM-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision LLMs Are Bad at Hierarchical Visual Understanding, and LLMs Are the Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24840v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper reveals that many state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) lack hierarchical knowledge about our visual world, unaware of even well-established biology taxonomies. This shortcoming makes LLMs a bottleneck for vision LLMs' hierarchical visual understanding (e.g., recognizing Anemone Fish but not Vertebrate). We arrive at these findings using about one million four-choice visual question answering (VQA) tasks constructed from six taxonomies and four image datasets. Interestingly, finetuning a vision LLM using our VQA tasks reaffirms LLMs' bottleneck effect to some extent because the VQA tasks improve the LLM's hierarchical consistency more than the vision LLM's. We conjecture that one cannot make vision LLMs understand visual concepts fully hierarchical until LLMs possess corresponding taxonomy knowledge.</p></details> | 28 pages, 13 figures |

We are Not There Yet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05291v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, thus it is important to understand their risks and limitations. Smaller LLMs can be deployed where compute resources are constrained, such as edge devices, but with different propensity to generate harmful output. Mitigation of LLM harm typically depends on annotating the harmfulness of LLM output, which is expensive to collect from humans. This work studies two questions: How do smaller LLMs rank regarding generation of harmful content? How well can larger LLMs annotate harmfulness? We prompt three small LLMs to elicit harmful content of various types, such as discriminatory language, offensive content, privacy invasion, or negative influence, and collect human rankings of their outputs. Then, we evaluate three state-of-the-art large LLMs on their ability to annotate the harmfulness of these responses. We find that the smaller models differ with respect to harmfulness. We also find that large LLMs show low to moderate agreement with humans. These findings underline the need for further work on harm mitigation in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

The presented framework applies the safety filter, designed based on the CBF, to the output generation of the baseline LLM, i.e., the sequence of the token, with the aim of intervening in the generated text. The overall text-generation system is implemented with Llama 3 and a RoBERTa model, and the source code is available at https://github.com/Mya-Mya/CBF-LLM. The experiment demonstrates its control ability and effectiveness in reducing the number of interventions needed for user-specified alignment tasks.</p></details> |  |

Adversarial prompts can bypass their safety measures. We propose LLM Self Defense, a simple approach to defend against these attacks by having an LLM screen the induced responses. Our method does not require any fine-tuning, input preprocessing, or iterative output generation. Instead, we incorporate the generated content into a pre-defined prompt and employ another instance of an LLM to analyze the text and predict whether it is harmful. We test LLM Self Defense on GPT 3.5 and Llama 2, two of the current most prominent LLMs against various types of attacks, such as forcefully inducing affirmative responses to prompts and prompt engineering attacks. Notably, LLM Self Defense succeeds in reducing the attack success rate to virtually 0 using both GPT 3.5 and Llama 2.

| **[LLMs + Persona-Plug = Personalized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11901v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization plays a critical role in numerous language tasks and applications, since users with the same requirements may prefer diverse outputs based on their individual interests. This has led to the development of various personalized approaches aimed at adapting large language models (LLMs) to generate customized outputs aligned with user preferences. Some of them involve fine-tuning a unique personalized LLM for each user, which is too expensive for widespread application. Alternative approaches introduce personalization information in a plug-and-play manner by retrieving the user's relevant historical texts as demonstrations. However, this retrieval-based strategy may break the continuity of the user history and fail to capture the user's overall styles and patterns, hence leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel personalized LLM model, \ours{}. It constructs a user-specific embedding for each individual by modeling all her historical contexts through a lightweight plug-in user embedder module. By attaching this embedding to the task input, LLMs can better understand and capture user habits and preferences, thereby producing more personalized outputs without tuning their own parameters. Extensive experiments on various tasks in the language model personalization (LaMP) benchmark demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing personalized LLM approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, participating in knowledge communities involves more than just contributing content - it is also a deeply social process. While communities must carefully consider appropriate and responsible LLM integration, the absence of concrete norms has left individual editors to experiment and navigate LLM use on their own. Understanding how LLMs influence community participation is therefore critical in shaping future norms and supporting effective adoption. To address this gap, we investigated Wikipedia, one of the largest knowledge production communities, to understand 1) how LLMs influence the ways editors contribute content, 2) what strategies editors leverage to align LLM outputs with community norms, and 3) how other editors in the community respond to LLM-assisted contributions. Through interviews with 16 Wikipedia editors who had used LLMs for their edits, we found that 1) LLMs affected the content contributions for experienced and new editors differently; 2) aligning LLM outputs with community norms required tacit knowledge that often challenged newcomers; and 3) as a result, other editors responded to LLM-assisted edits differently depending on the editors' expertise level. Based on these findings, we challenge existing models of newcomer involvement and propose design implications for LLMs that support community engagement through scaffolding, teaching, and context awareness.</p></details> |  |

With the success of large language models (LLMs), they have been employed in various tasks, including serving as judges (LLM-as-a-judge). In this paper, we reassess the performance of QA models using LLM-as-a-judge across four reading comprehension QA datasets. We examine different families of LLMs and various answer types to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-as-a-judge in these tasks. Our results show that LLM-as-a-judge is highly correlated with human judgments and can replace traditional EM/F1 metrics. By using LLM-as-a-judge, the correlation with human judgments improves significantly, from 0.22 (EM) and 0.40 (F1-score) to 0.85. These findings confirm that EM and F1 metrics underestimate the true performance of the QA models. While LLM-as-a-judge is not perfect for more difficult answer types (e.g., job), it still outperforms EM/F1, and we observe no bias issues, such as self-preference, when the same model is used for both the QA and judgment tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; code and data are available at https://github.com/Alab-NII/llm-judge-extract-qa</p></details> |

A common approach to sort the ranking list is by prompting LLMs for a pairwise or setwise comparison which often relies on sorting algorithms. However, sorting-based methods require consistent comparisons to correctly sort the passages, which we show that LLMs often violate. We identify two kinds of intrinsic inconsistency in LLM-based pairwise comparisons: order inconsistency which leads to conflicting results when switching the passage order, and transitive inconsistency which leads to non-transitive triads among all preference pairs. Our study of these inconsistencies is relevant for understanding and improving the stability of any ranking scheme based on relative preferences. In this paper, we propose LLM-RankFusion, an LLM-based ranking framework that mitigates these inconsistencies and produces a robust ranking list. LLM-RankFusion mitigates order inconsistency using in-context learning (ICL) to demonstrate order-agnostic comparisons and calibration to estimate the underlying preference probability between two passages. We then address transitive inconsistency by aggregating the ranking results from multiple rankers. In our experiments, we empirically show that LLM-RankFusion can significantly reduce inconsistent comparison results, improving the ranking quality by making the final ranking list more robust. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/XHMY/LLM-RankFusion}{https://github.com/XHMY/LLM-RankFusion}</p></details> |  |
| **[From LLMs to LLM-based Agents for Software Engineering: A Survey of Current, Challenges and Future](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02479v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), researchers are increasingly exploring their applications in var ious vertical domains, such as software engineering. LLMs have achieved remarkable success in areas including code generation and vulnerability detection. However, they also exhibit numerous limitations and shortcomings. LLM-based agents, a novel tech nology with the potential for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), combine LLMs as the core for decision-making and action-taking, addressing some of the inherent limitations of LLMs such as lack of autonomy and self-improvement. Despite numerous studies and surveys exploring the possibility of using LLMs in software engineering, it lacks a clear distinction between LLMs and LLM based agents. It is still in its early stage for a unified standard and benchmarking to qualify an LLM solution as an LLM-based agent in its domain. In this survey, we broadly investigate the current practice and solutions for LLMs and LLM-based agents for software engineering. In particular we summarise six key topics: requirement engineering, code generation, autonomous decision-making, software design, test generation, and software maintenance. We review and differentiate the work of LLMs and LLM-based agents from these six topics, examining their differences and similarities in tasks, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the models and benchmarks used, providing a comprehensive analysis of their applications and effectiveness in software engineering. We anticipate this work will shed some lights on pushing the boundaries of LLM-based agents in software engineering for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Indirect LLM Jailbreak via Multimodal-LLM Jailbreak](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20015v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on jailbreaking attacks against large language models (LLMs), eliciting them to generate objectionable content in response to harmful user queries. Unlike previous LLM-jailbreak methods that directly orient to LLMs, our approach begins by constructing a multimodal large language model (MLLM) built upon the target LLM. Subsequently, we perform an efficient MLLM jailbreak and obtain a jailbreaking embedding. Finally, we convert the embedding into a textual jailbreaking suffix to carry out the jailbreak of target LLM. Compared to the direct LLM-jailbreak methods, our indirect jailbreaking approach is more efficient, as MLLMs are more vulnerable to jailbreak than pure LLM. Additionally, to improve the attack success rate of jailbreak, we propose an image-text semantic matching scheme to identify a suitable initial input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art jailbreak methods in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior cross-class generalization abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[FusionFactory: Fusing LLM Capabilities with Multi-LLM Log Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10540v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has created a diverse landscape of models, each excelling at different tasks. This diversity drives researchers to employ multiple LLMs in practice, leaving behind valuable multi-LLM log data. This naturally leads to the question of whether such logs can be fully leveraged to fuse LLMs' complementary capabilities. Although prior work has explored various strategies for integrating multiple LLMs, we argue that practical fusion must meet two essential requirements: (1) compatibility with real-world serving scenarios (e.g., local and API-based serving), and (2) flexibility to operate at different stages of the LLM pipeline to meet varied user needs (e.g., fine-tuning and inference stages). To this end, we introduce LLMFusionBench, a large-scale benchmark for LLM fusion that spans 14 tasks across five domains, with responses from 20 open-source LLMs (8B--671B) totaling 103M tokens. Building on LLMFusionBench, we propose FusionFactory, a systematic framework with three elaborated levels: (1) query-level fusion via tailored LLM routers, (2) thought-level fusion leveraging retrieved abstract reasoning templates, and (3) model-level fusion via distillation from top-ranked responses. Experiments show that FusionFactory consistently outperforms the best individual LLM across all 14 benchmarks, with the optimal fusion configuration varying across benchmarks, highlighting the promise of multi-LLM log data as a practical foundation for fusing diverse LLM capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Densing Law of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04315v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a milestone in artificial intelligence, and their performance can improve as the model size increases. However, this scaling brings great challenges to training and inference efficiency, particularly for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments, and the scaling trend is becoming increasingly unsustainable. This paper introduces the concept of ``\textit{capacity density}'' as a new metric to evaluate the quality of the LLMs across different scales and describes the trend of LLMs in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To calculate the capacity density of a given target LLM, we first introduce a set of reference models and develop a scaling law to predict the downstream performance of these reference models based on their parameter sizes. We then define the \textit{effective parameter size} of the target LLM as the parameter size required by a reference model to achieve equivalent performance, and formalize the capacity density as the ratio of the effective parameter size to the actual parameter size of the target LLM. Capacity density provides a unified framework for assessing both model effectiveness and efficiency. Our further analysis of recent open-source base LLMs reveals an empirical law (the densing law)that the capacity density of LLMs grows exponentially over time. More specifically, using some widely used benchmarks for evaluation, the capacity density of LLMs doubles approximately every three months. The law provides new perspectives to guide future LLM development, emphasizing the importance of improving capacity density to achieve optimal results with minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://awesome-llm-as-a-judge.github.io/</p></details> |

We introduce $\textbf{LLM-BabyBench}$, a new benchmark suite designed specifically for this purpose. Built upon a textual adaptation of the procedurally generated BabyAI grid world, this suite evaluates LLMs on three fundamental aspects of grounded intelligence: (1) predicting the consequences of actions on the environment state ($\textbf{Predict}$ task), (2) generating sequences of low-level actions to achieve specified objectives ($\textbf{Plan}$ task), and (3) decomposing high-level instructions into coherent subgoal sequences ($\textbf{Decompose}$ task). We detail the methodology for generating the three corresponding datasets ($\texttt{LLM-BabyBench-Predict}$, $\texttt{-Plan}$, $\texttt{-Decompose}$) by extracting structured information from an expert agent operating within the text-based environment. Furthermore, we provide a standardized evaluation harness and metrics, including environment interaction for validating generated plans, to facilitate reproducible assessment of diverse LLMs. Initial baseline results highlight the challenges posed by these grounded reasoning tasks. The benchmark suite, datasets, data generation code, and evaluation code are made publicly available ($\href{https://github.com/choukrani/llm-babybench}{\text{GitHub}}$, $\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/salem-mbzuai/LLM-BabyBench}{\text{HuggingFace}}$).</p></details> |  |

This approach leverages multi-turn interactions where the LLM interviewer actively provides feedback on responses and poses follow-up questions to the evaluated LLM. At the start of the interview, the LLM interviewer dynamically modifies datasets to generate initial questions, mitigating data contamination. We apply the LLM-as-an-Interviewer framework to evaluate six models on the MATH and DepthQA tasks. Our results show that the framework effectively provides insights into LLM performance, including the quality of initial responses, adaptability to feedback, and ability to address follow-up queries like clarification or additional knowledge requests. The framework also addresses key limitations of conventional methods like LLM-as-a-Judge, including verbosity bias and inconsistency across runs. Finally, we propose the Interview Report, which aggregates insights from the interview process, providing examples and a comprehensive analysis of the LLM's strengths and weaknesses. This report offers a detailed snapshot of the model's real-world applicability. The code for our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/interview-eval/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuning LLMs by RAG Principles: Towards LLM-native Memory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16071v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory, additional information beyond the training of large language models (LLMs), is crucial to various real-world applications, such as personal assistant. The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-LLM Debiasing Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13884v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with the potential to benefit society immensely, yet, they have demonstrated biases that perpetuate societal inequalities. Despite significant advancements in bias mitigation techniques using data augmentation, zero-shot prompting, and model fine-tuning, biases continuously persist, including subtle biases that may elude human detection. Recent research has shown a growing interest in multi-LLM approaches, which have been demonstrated to be effective in improving the quality of reasoning and factuality in LLMs. Building on this approach, we propose a novel multi-LLM debiasing framework aimed at reducing bias in LLMs. Our work is the first to introduce and evaluate two distinct approaches within this framework for debiasing LLMs: a centralized method, where the conversation is facilitated by a single central LLM, and a decentralized method, where all models communicate directly. Our findings reveal that our multi-LLM framework significantly reduces bias in LLMs, outperforming the baseline method across several social groups.</p></details> |  |

We present LLM Attributor, a Python library that provides interactive visualizations for training data attribution of an LLM's text generation. Our library offers a new way to quickly attribute an LLM's text generation to training data points to inspect model behaviors, enhance its trustworthiness, and compare model-generated text with user-provided text. We describe the visual and interactive design of our tool and highlight usage scenarios for LLaMA2 models fine-tuned with two different datasets: online articles about recent disasters and finance-related question-answer pairs. Thanks to LLM Attributor's broad support for computational notebooks, users can easily integrate it into their workflow to interactively visualize attributions of their models.

| **[LLM-Evaluation Tropes: Perspectives on the Validity of LLM-Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19076v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate information retrieval (IR) systems, generating relevance judgments traditionally made by human assessors. Recent empirical studies suggest that LLM-based evaluations often align with human judgments, leading some to suggest that human judges may no longer be necessary, while others highlight concerns about judgment reliability, validity, and long-term impact. As IR systems begin incorporating LLM-generated signals, evaluation outcomes risk becoming self-reinforcing, potentially leading to misleading conclusions. This paper examines scenarios where LLM-evaluators may falsely indicate success, particularly when LLM-based judgments influence both system development and evaluation. We highlight key risks, including bias reinforcement, reproducibility challenges, and inconsistencies in assessment methodologies. To address these concerns, we propose tests to quantify adverse effects, guardrails, and a collaborative framework for constructing reusable test collections that integrate LLM judgments responsibly. By providing perspectives from academia and industry, this work aims to establish best practices for the principled use of LLMs in IR evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous LLM Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07017v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) use function calls to interface with external tools and data source. However, the current approach to LLM function calling is inherently synchronous, where each call blocks LLM inference, limiting LLM operation and concurrent function execution. In this work, we propose AsyncLM, a system for asynchronous LLM function calling. AsyncLM improves LLM's operational efficiency by enabling LLMs to generate and execute function calls concurrently. Instead of waiting for each call's completion, AsyncLM introduces an interrupt mechanism to asynchronously notify the LLM in-flight when function calls return. We design an in-context protocol for function calls and interrupts, provide fine-tuning strategy to adapt LLMs to the interrupt semantics, and implement these mechanisms efficiently on LLM inference process. We demonstrate that AsyncLM can reduce end-to-end task completion latency from 1.6x-5.4x compared to synchronous function calling on a set of benchmark tasks in the Berkeley function calling leaderboard (BFCL). Furthermore, we discuss how interrupt mechanisms can be extended to enable novel human-LLM or LLM-LLM interactions.</p></details> |  |

Existing works aim to enhance LLM capabilities via domain-specific adaptation, which require additional training on accessible model parameters, an infeasible option for black-box LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce Matryoshka Pilot (M-Pilot), a lightweight white-box LLM controller that guides a large-scale black-box LLM generator by decomposing complex tasks into a series of intermediate outputs. Specifically, we consider the black-box LLM as an environment, with M-Pilot serving as a policy to provide intermediate guidance through prompts for driving the black-box LLM. M-Pilot is trained to pivot the outputs of the black-box LLM aligning with preferences during iterative interaction, which enables controllable multi-turn generation and self-improvement in optimizing intermediate guidance. Empirical evaluations on diverse tasks demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the capabilities of black-box LLMs in complex, long-horizon tasks.

Cybersecurity is one of the key sectors where LLMs can be and/or are already being used. There are a number of problems that inhibit the adoption of trustworthy Gen AI and LLMs in cybersecurity and such other critical areas. One of the key challenge to the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs is: how consistent an LLM is in its responses? In this paper, we have analyzed and developed a formal definition of consistency of responses of LLMs. We have formally defined what is consistency of responses and then develop a framework for consistency evaluation. The paper proposes two approaches to validate consistency: self-validation, and validation across multiple LLMs. We have carried out extensive experiments for several LLMs such as GPT4oMini, GPT3.5, Gemini, Cohere, and Llama3, on a security benchmark consisting of several cybersecurity questions: informational and situational. Our experiments corroborate the fact that even though these LLMs are being considered and/or already being used for several cybersecurity tasks today, they are often inconsistent in their responses, and thus are untrustworthy and unreliable for cybersecurity.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables, 3 algorithms, 2024 IEEE 6th International Conference on Trust, Privacy and Security in Intelligent Systems, and Applications (TPS-ISA), Washington, DC, USA</p></details> |

Meanwhile, much less attention has been given to mitigating the costs associated with deploying multiple LLMs of varying sizes despite its practical significance. Thus, this paper introduces \emph{any-precision LLM}, extending the concept of any-precision DNN to LLMs. Addressing challenges in any-precision LLM, we propose a lightweight method for any-precision quantization of LLMs, leveraging a post-training quantization framework, and develop a specialized software engine for its efficient serving. As a result, our solution significantly reduces the high costs of deploying multiple, different-sized LLMs by overlaying LLMs quantized to varying bit-widths, such as 3, 4, ..., $n$ bits, into a memory footprint comparable to a single $n$-bit LLM. All the supported LLMs with varying bit-widths demonstrate state-of-the-art model quality and inference throughput, proving itself to be a compelling option for deployment of multiple, different-sized LLMs. Our code is open-sourced and available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICML 2024.

| **[Infinite-LLM: Efficient LLM Service for Long Context with DistAttention and Distributed KVCache](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02669v2)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial potential across a diverse array of domains via request serving. However, as trends continue to push for expanding context sizes, the autoregressive nature of LLMs results in highly dynamic behavior of the attention layers, showcasing significant differences in computational characteristics and memory requirements from the non-attention layers. This presents substantial challenges for resource management and performance optimization in service systems. Existing static model parallelism and resource allocation strategies fall short when dealing with this dynamicity. To address the issue, we propose Infinite-LLM, a novel LLM serving system designed to effectively handle dynamic context lengths. Infinite-LLM disaggregates attention layers from an LLM's inference process, facilitating flexible and independent resource scheduling that optimizes computational performance and enhances memory utilization jointly. By leveraging a pooled GPU memory strategy across a cluster, Infinite-LLM not only significantly boosts system throughput but also supports extensive context lengths. Evaluated on a dataset with context lengths ranging from a few to 2000K tokens across a cluster with 32 A100 GPUs, Infinite-LLM demonstrates throughput improvement of 1.35-3.4x compared to state-of-the-art methods, enabling efficient and elastic LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging LLMs as Meta-Judges: A Multi-Agent Framework for Evaluating LLM Judgments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17087v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are being widely applied across various fields, but as tasks become more complex, evaluating their responses is increasingly challenging. Compared to human evaluators, the use of LLMs to support performance evaluation offers a more efficient alternative. However, most studies focus mainly on aligning LLMs' judgments with human preferences, overlooking the existence of biases and mistakes in human judgment. Furthermore, how to select suitable LLM judgments given multiple potential LLM responses remains underexplored. To address these two aforementioned issues, we propose a three-stage meta-judge selection pipeline: 1) developing a comprehensive rubric with GPT-4 and human experts, 2) using three advanced LLM agents to score judgments, and 3) applying a threshold to filter out low-scoring judgments. Compared to methods using a single LLM as both judge and meta-judge, our pipeline introduces multi-agent collaboration and a more comprehensive rubric. Experimental results on the JudgeBench dataset show about 15.55\% improvement compared to raw judgments and about 8.37\% improvement over the single-agent baseline. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs as meta-judges and lays the foundation for future research on constructing preference datasets for LLM-as-a-judge reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[From LLMs to Agents: A Comparative Evaluation of LLMs and LLM-based Agents in Security Patch Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.08060v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of open-source software (OSS) has accelerated software innovation but also increased security risks due to the rapid propagation of vulnerabilities and silent patch releases. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various software engineering (SE) tasks, enabling them to effectively address software security challenges such as vulnerability detection. However, systematic evaluation of the capabilities of LLMs and LLM-based agents in security patch detection remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of LLMs and LLM-based agents for security patch detection. Specifically, we investigate three methods: Plain LLM (a single LLM with a system prompt), Data-Aug LLM (data augmentation based on the Plain LLM), and the ReAct Agent (leveraging the thought-action-observation mechanism). We also evaluate the performance of both commercial and open-source LLMs under these methods and compare these results with those of existing baselines. Furthermore, we analyze the detection performance of these methods across various vulnerability types, and examine the impact of different prompting strategies and context window sizes on the results. Our findings reveal that the Data-Aug LLM achieves the best overall performance, whereas the ReAct Agent demonstrates the lowest false positive rate (FPR). Although baseline methods exhibit strong accuracy, their false positive rates are significantly higher. In contrast, our evaluated methods achieve comparable accuracy while substantially reducing the FPR. These findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of LLMs and LLM-based agents in security patch detection, highlighting their advantage in maintaining robust performance while minimizing false positive rates.</p></details> |  |

By reasoning about traffic patterns in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, accurate and interpretable predictions can be provided. A considerable challenge in traffic prediction lies in handling the diverse data distributions caused by vastly different traffic conditions occurring at different locations. LLMs have been a dominant solution due to their remarkable capacity to adapt to new datasets with very few labeled data samples, i.e., few-shot adaptability. However, existing forecasting techniques mainly focus on extracting local graph information and forming a text-like prompt, leaving LLM- based traffic prediction an open problem. This work presents a probabilistic LLM for traffic forecasting with three highlights. We propose a graph-aware LLM for traffic prediction that considers proximal traffic information. Specifically, by considering the traffic of neighboring nodes as covariates, our model outperforms the corresponding time-series LLM. Furthermore, we adopt a lightweight approach for efficient domain adaptation when facing new data distributions in few-shot fashion. The comparative experiment demonstrates the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based methods and the traditional GNN- based supervised approaches. Furthermore, Strada-LLM can be easily adapted to different LLM backbones without a noticeable performance drop.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The reviewers decided to reject it.

| **[Can LLM be a Personalized Judge?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11657v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) reflect diverse user values and preferences is crucial as their user bases expand globally. It is therefore encouraging to see the growing interest in LLM personalization within the research community. However, current works often rely on the LLM-as-a-Judge approach for evaluation without thoroughly examining its validity. In this paper, we investigate the reliability of LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge, asking LLMs to judge user preferences based on personas. Our findings suggest that directly applying LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge is less reliable than previously assumed, showing low and inconsistent agreement with human ground truth. The personas typically used are often overly simplistic, resulting in low predictive power. To address these issues, we introduce verbal uncertainty estimation into the LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge pipeline, allowing the model to express low confidence on uncertain judgments. This adjustment leads to much higher agreement (above 80%) on high-certainty samples for binary tasks. Through human evaluation, we find that the LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge achieves comparable performance to third-party humans evaluation and even surpasses human performance on high-certainty samples. Our work indicates that certainty-enhanced LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge offers a promising direction for developing more reliable and scalable methods for evaluating LLM personalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/dong-river/Personalized-Judge</p></details> |

While researchers have explored the potential of LLMs in various domains, this paper focuses on their use in programming tasks, drawing insights from user studies that assess the impact of LLMs on programming tasks. We first examined the user interaction behaviors with LLMs observed in these studies, from the types of requests made to task completion strategies. Additionally, our analysis reveals both benefits and weaknesses of LLMs showing mixed effects on the human and task. Lastly, we looked into what factors from the human, LLM or the interaction of both, affect the human's enhancement as well as the task performance. Our findings highlight the variability in human-LLM interactions due to the non-deterministic nature of both parties (humans and LLMs), underscoring the need for a deeper understanding of these interaction patterns.

However, challenges arise in assessing LLM-as-a-tutor due to differing standards between educational and general use cases. To bridge this gap, we integrate pedagogical principles to assess student-LLM interaction. First, we explore how LLMs can function as English tutors, providing effective essay feedback tailored to students. Second, we propose three metrics to evaluate LLM-as-a-tutor specifically designed for EFL writing education, emphasizing pedagogical aspects. In this process, EFL experts evaluate the feedback from LLM-as-a-tutor regarding quality and characteristics. On the other hand, EFL learners assess their learning outcomes from interaction with LLM-as-a-tutor. This approach lays the groundwork for developing LLMs-as-a-tutor tailored to the needs of EFL learners, advancing the effectiveness of writing education in this context.</p></details> |  |

Replicating Crowdsourcing Pipelines with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.10168v3)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have shown promise in replicating human-like behavior in crowdsourcing tasks that were previously thought to be exclusive to human abilities. However, current efforts focus mainly on simple atomic tasks. We explore whether LLMs can replicate more complex crowdsourcing pipelines. We find that modern LLMs can simulate some of crowdworkers' abilities in these ``human computation algorithms,'' but the level of success is variable and influenced by requesters' understanding of LLM capabilities, the specific skills required for sub-tasks, and the optimal interaction modality for performing these sub-tasks. We reflect on human and LLMs' different sensitivities to instructions, stress the importance of enabling human-facing safeguards for LLMs, and discuss the potential of training humans and LLMs with complementary skill sets. Crucially, we show that replicating crowdsourcing pipelines offers a valuable platform to investigate 1) the relative LLM strengths on different tasks (by cross-comparing their performances on sub-tasks) and 2) LLMs' potential in complex tasks, where they can complete part of the tasks while leaving others to humans.</p></details> |  |

However, there is still a gap between LLMs being capable coders and being top-tier software engineers. Based on the observation that top-level software engineers often ask clarifying questions to reduce ambiguity in both requirements and coding solutions, we argue that the same should be applied to LLMs for code generation tasks. In this work, we conducted an empirical study on the benchmark and analysis of the communication skills of LLMs for code generation. We define communication skills of LLMs as ``being able to ask clarifying questions when the description of the code generation problem has issues''. We created a new benchmark, HumanEvalComm, by modifying problem descriptions according to three issues: inconsistency, ambiguity, incompleteness. We defined new evaluation metrics such as Communication Rate and Good Question Rate, and then experimented on HumanEvalComm with different Code LLMs, and a new LLM agent approach, Okanagan, to identify and ask questions in ambiguous parts from code and descriptions for further refining the generated code. Finally, we discussed evaluation results by comparing Code LLMs and Okanagan with our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 6 figures, 16 tables.

As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.</p></details> | 25 pages |

An Empirical Investigation of LLM's Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09733v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can make up answers that are not real, and this is known as hallucination. This research aims to see if, how, and to what extent LLMs are aware of hallucination. More specifically, we check whether and how an LLM reacts differently in its hidden states when it answers a question right versus when it hallucinates. To do this, we introduce an experimental framework which allows examining LLM's hidden states in different hallucination situations. Building upon this framework, we conduct a series of experiments with language models in the LLaMA family (Touvron et al., 2023). Our empirical findings suggest that LLMs react differently when processing a genuine response versus a fabricated one. We then apply various model interpretation techniques to help understand and explain the findings better. Moreover, informed by the empirical observations, we show great potential of using the guidance derived from LLM's hidden representation space to mitigate hallucination. We believe this work provides insights into how LLMs produce hallucinated answers and how to make them occur less often.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables (13 pages, 12 figures, 13 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |

However, current methods predominantly emphasize maintaining the performance of compressed LLMs, as measured by perplexity or simple accuracy on tasks of common sense knowledge QA and basic arithmetic reasoning. In this blog, we present a brief review of recent advancements in LLMs related to retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, external tools, and computational expressivity, all of which substantially enhance LLM performance. Then, we propose a lottery LLM hypothesis suggesting that for a given LLM and task, there exists a smaller lottery LLM capable of producing the same performance as the original LLM with the assistance of multi-step reasoning and external tools. Based on the review of current progress in LLMs, we discuss and summarize the essential capabilities that the lottery LLM and KV cache compression must possess, which are currently overlooked in existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dean of LLM Tutors: Exploring Comprehensive and Automated Evaluation of LLM-generated Educational Feedback via LLM Feedback Evaluators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05952v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of LLM tutors to provide automated educational feedback to students on student assignment submissions has received much attention in the AI in Education field. However, the stochastic nature and tendency for hallucinations in LLMs can undermine both quality of learning experience and adherence to ethical standards. To address this concern, we propose a method that uses LLM feedback evaluators (DeanLLMs) to automatically and comprehensively evaluate feedback generated by LLM tutor for submissions on university assignments before it is delivered to students. This allows low-quality feedback to be rejected and enables LLM tutors to improve the feedback they generated based on the evaluation results. We first proposed a comprehensive evaluation framework for LLM-generated educational feedback, comprising six dimensions for feedback content, seven for feedback effectiveness, and three for hallucination types. Next, we generated a virtual assignment submission dataset covering 85 university assignments from 43 computer science courses using eight commonly used commercial LLMs. We labelled and open-sourced the assignment dataset to support the fine-tuning and evaluation of LLM feedback evaluators. Our findings show that o3-pro demonstrated the best performance in zero-shot labelling of feedback while o4-mini demonstrated the best performance in few-shot labelling of feedback. Moreover, GPT-4.1 achieved human expert level performance after fine-tuning (Accuracy 79.8%, F1-score 79.4%; human average Accuracy 78.3%, F1-score 82.6%). Finally, we used our best-performance model to evaluate 2,000 assignment feedback instances generated by 10 common commercial LLMs, 200 each, to compare the quality of feedback generated by different LLMs. Our LLM feedback evaluator method advances our ability to automatically provide high-quality and reliable educational feedback to students.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-AutoDiff: Auto-Differentiate Any LLM Workflow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16673v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing, powering applications from multi-hop retrieval and question answering to autonomous agent workflows. Yet, prompt engineering -- the task of crafting textual inputs to effectively direct LLMs -- remains difficult and labor-intensive, particularly for complex pipelines that combine multiple LLM calls with functional operations like retrieval and data formatting. We introduce LLM-AutoDiff: a novel framework for Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) that extends textual gradient-based methods (such as Text-Grad) to multi-component, potentially cyclic LLM architectures. Implemented within the AdalFlow library, LLM-AutoDiff treats each textual input as a trainable parameter and uses a frozen backward engine LLM to generate feedback-akin to textual gradients -- that guide iterative prompt updates. Unlike prior single-node approaches, LLM-AutoDiff inherently accommodates functional nodes, preserves time-sequential behavior in repeated calls (e.g., multi-hop loops), and combats the "lost-in-the-middle" problem by isolating distinct sub-prompts (instructions, formats, or few-shot examples). It further boosts training efficiency by focusing on error-prone samples through selective gradient computation. Across diverse tasks, including single-step classification, multi-hop retrieval-based QA, and agent-driven pipelines, LLM-AutoDiff consistently outperforms existing textual gradient baselines in both accuracy and training cost. By unifying prompt optimization through a graph-centric lens, LLM-AutoDiff offers a powerful new paradigm for scaling and automating LLM workflows - mirroring the transformative role that automatic differentiation libraries have long played in neural network research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance Gains of LLMs With Humans in a World of LLMs Versus Humans](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08902v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, a considerable research effort is devoted to comparing LLMs to a group of human experts, where the term "expert" is often ill-defined or variable, at best, in a state of constantly updating LLM releases. Without proper safeguards in place, LLMs will threaten to cause harm to the established structure of safe delivery of patient care which has been carefully developed throughout history to keep the safety of the patient at the forefront. A key driver of LLM innovation is founded on community research efforts which, if continuing to operate under "humans versus LLMs" principles, will expedite this trend. Therefore, research efforts moving forward must focus on effectively characterizing the safe use of LLMs in clinical settings that persist across the rapid development of novel LLM models. In this communication, we demonstrate that rather than comparing LLMs to humans, there is a need to develop strategies enabling efficient work of humans with LLMs in an almost symbiotic manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[BED-LLM: Intelligent Information Gathering with LLMs and Bayesian Experimental Design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21184v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments. Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated (and then estimated) in a principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's predictive distributions and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its construction and updating procedure. We find that BED-LLM achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on the 20 questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences, compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Audit and Analysis of LLM-Assisted Health Misinformation Jailbreaks Against LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10010v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are a double-edged sword capable of generating harmful misinformation -- inadvertently, or when prompted by "jailbreak" attacks that attempt to produce malicious outputs. LLMs could, with additional research, be used to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy and characteristics of LLM-produced jailbreak attacks that cause other models to produce harmful medical misinformation. We also study how misinformation generated by jailbroken LLMs compares to typical misinformation found on social media, and how effectively it can be detected using standard machine learning approaches. Specifically, we closely examine 109 distinct attacks against three target LLMs and compare the attack prompts to in-the-wild health-related LLM queries. We also examine the resulting jailbreak responses, comparing the generated misinformation to health-related misinformation on Reddit. Our findings add more evidence that LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation from both other LLMs and from people, and support a body of work suggesting that with careful design, LLMs can contribute to a healthier overall information ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[User-LLM: Efficient LLM Contextualization with User Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13598v2)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, but effectively incorporating complex and potentially noisy user timeline data into LLMs remains a challenge. Current approaches often involve translating user timelines into text descriptions before feeding them to LLMs, which can be inefficient and may not fully capture the nuances of user behavior. Inspired by how LLMs are effectively integrated with images through direct embeddings, we propose User-LLM, a novel framework that leverages user embeddings to directly contextualize LLMs with user history interactions. These embeddings, generated by a user encoder pretrained using self-supervised learning on diverse user interactions, capture latent user behaviors and interests as well as their evolution over time. We integrate these user embeddings with LLMs through cross-attention, enabling LLMs to dynamically adapt their responses based on the context of a user's past actions and preferences. Our approach achieves significant efficiency gains by representing user timelines directly as embeddings, leading to substantial inference speedups of up to 78.1X. Comprehensive experiments on MovieLens, Amazon Review, and Google Local Review datasets demonstrate that User-LLM outperforms text-prompt-based contextualization on tasks requiring deep user understanding, with improvements of up to 16.33%, particularly excelling on long sequences that capture subtle shifts in user behavior. Furthermore, the incorporation of Perceiver layers streamlines the integration between user encoders and LLMs, yielding additional computational savings.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs Can't Plan, But Can Help Planning in LLM-Modulo Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01817v3)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is considerable confusion about the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in planning and reasoning tasks. On one side are over-optimistic claims that LLMs can indeed do these tasks with just the right prompting or self-verification strategies. On the other side are perhaps over-pessimistic claims that all that LLMs are good for in planning/reasoning tasks are as mere translators of the problem specification from one syntactic format to another, and ship the problem off to external symbolic solvers. In this position paper, we take the view that both these extremes are misguided. We argue that auto-regressive LLMs cannot, by themselves, do planning or self-verification (which is after all a form of reasoning), and shed some light on the reasons for misunderstandings in the literature. We will also argue that LLMs should be viewed as universal approximate knowledge sources that have much more meaningful roles to play in planning/reasoning tasks beyond simple front-end/back-end format translators. We present a vision of {\bf LLM-Modulo Frameworks} that combine the strengths of LLMs with external model-based verifiers in a tighter bi-directional interaction regime. We will show how the models driving the external verifiers themselves can be acquired with the help of LLMs. We will also argue that rather than simply pipelining LLMs and symbolic components, this LLM-Modulo Framework provides a better neuro-symbolic approach that offers tighter integration between LLMs and symbolic components, and allows extending the scope of model-based planning/reasoning regimes towards more flexible knowledge, problem and preference specifications.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs), trained on vast corpora, have shown strong potential in data generation, making them a promising tool for data imputation. However, challenges persist in designing effective prompts for a finetuning-free process and in mitigating biases and uncertainty in LLM outputs. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, LLM-Forest, which introduces a "forest" of few-shot prompt learning LLM "trees" with their outputs aggregated via confidence-based weighted voting based on LLM self-assessment, inspired by the ensemble learning (Random Forest). This framework is established on a new concept of bipartite information graphs to identify high-quality relevant neighboring entries with both feature and value granularity. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM-Forest.</p></details> |  |

An Empirical Study of LLM-as-a-Judge in Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06193v3)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been deployed to tackle various software engineering (SE) tasks like code generation, significantly advancing the automation of SE tasks. However, assessing the quality of these LLM-generated code and text remains challenging. The commonly used Pass@k metric necessitates extensive unit tests and configured environments, demands a high labor cost, and is not suitable for evaluating LLM-generated text. Conventional metrics like BLEU, which measure only lexical rather than semantic similarity, have also come under scrutiny. In response, a new trend has emerged to employ LLMs for automated evaluation, known as LLM-as-a-judge. These LLM-as-a-judge methods are claimed to better mimic human assessment than conventional metrics without relying on high-quality reference answers. Nevertheless, their exact human alignment in SE tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we empirically explore LLM-as-a-judge methods for evaluating SE tasks, focusing on their alignment with human judgments. We select seven LLM-as-a-judge methods that utilize general-purpose LLMs, alongside two LLMs specifically fine-tuned for evaluation. After generating and manually scoring LLM responses on three recent SE datasets of code translation, code generation, and code summarization, we then prompt these methods to evaluate each response. Finally, we compare the scores generated by these methods with human evaluation. The results indicate that output-based methods reach the highest Pearson correlation of 81.32 and 68.51 with human scores in code translation and generation, achieving near-human evaluation, noticeably outperforming ChrF++, one of the best conventional metrics, at 34.23 and 64.92. Such output-based methods prompt LLMs to output judgments directly, and exhibit more balanced score distributions that resemble human score patterns.

Investigating Vulnerabilities in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20529v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered significant popularity and wielded immense power across various domains within Natural Language Processing (NLP). While their capabilities are undeniably impressive, it is crucial to identify and scrutinize their vulnerabilities especially when those vulnerabilities can have costly consequences. One such LLM, trained to provide a concise summarization from medical documents could unequivocally leak personal patient data when prompted surreptitiously. This is just one of many unfortunate examples that have been unveiled and further research is necessary to comprehend the underlying reasons behind such vulnerabilities. In this study, we delve into multiple sections of vulnerabilities which are model-based, training-time, inference-time vulnerabilities, and discuss mitigation strategies including "Model Editing" which aims at modifying LLMs behavior, and "Chroma Teaming" which incorporates synergy of multiple teaming strategies to enhance LLMs' resilience. This paper will synthesize the findings from each vulnerability section and propose new directions of research and development. By understanding the focal points of current vulnerabilities, we can better anticipate and mitigate future risks, paving the road for more robust and secure LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 1 figure. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.12503</p></details> |

To improve human evaluation ability and overcome that limitation this work trains "critic" models that help humans to more accurately evaluate model-written code. These critics are themselves LLMs trained with RLHF to write natural language feedback highlighting problems in code from real-world assistant tasks. On code containing naturally occurring LLM errors model-written critiques are preferred over human critiques in 63% of cases, and human evaluation finds that models catch more bugs than human contractors paid for code review. We further confirm that our fine-tuned LLM critics can successfully identify hundreds of errors in ChatGPT training data rated as "flawless", even though the majority of those tasks are non-code tasks and thus out-of-distribution for the critic model. Critics can have limitations of their own, including hallucinated bugs that could mislead humans into making mistakes they might have otherwise avoided, but human-machine teams of critics and contractors catch similar numbers of bugs to LLM critics while hallucinating less than LLMs alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wider and Deeper LLM Networks are Fairer LLM Evaluators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01862v1)** | 2023-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measuring the quality of responses generated by LLMs is a challenging task, particularly when it comes to evaluating whether the response is aligned with human preference. A novel approach involves using the LLM itself to make evaluation and stabilizing the results through multiple independent evaluations, similar to a single-layer narrow LLM network. This network consists of a fixed number of neurons, with each neuron being the same LLM. In this paper, we draw upon the extensive research on deep neural networks to explore whether deeper and wider networks can lead to fairer evaluations. Specifically, inspired by the observation that different neurons in a neural network are responsible for detecting different concepts, we first adaptively generate as many neuron roles as possible for each evaluation sample. Each perspective corresponds to the role of a specific LLM neuron in the first layer. In subsequent layers, we follow the idea that higher layers in deep networks are responsible for more comprehensive features, each layer receives representations from all neurons in the previous layer, integrating the locally learned evaluation information to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation result. Interestingly, this network design resembles the process of academic paper reviewing. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we construct the largest and most diverse English evaluation benchmark LLMEval$^2$ for LLM evaluators, comprising 15 tasks, 8 abilities, and 2,553 samples. Experimental results demonstrate that a wider network (involving many reviewers) with 2 layers (one round of discussion) performs the best, improving kappa correlation coefficient from 0.28 to 0.34. We also leverage WideDeep to aid in the assessment of Chinese LLMs, which has accelerated the evaluation time by 4.6 times, resulting in a 60% cost saving. WideDeep achieves a remarkable 93% agreement level among humans.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

However, LLMs may exhibit flaws such as hallucinations, forgetfulness, or misinterpretations of prompts, causing logical inconsistencies and unexpected deviations from intended designs. Automated techniques for detecting such game bugs are still lacking. To address this, we propose a systematic LLM-based method for automatically identifying such bugs from player game logs, eliminating the need for collecting additional data such as post-play surveys. Applied to a text-based game DejaBoom!, our approach effectively identifies bugs inherent in LLM-powered interactive games, surpassing unstructured LLM-powered bug-catching methods and filling the gap in automated detection of logical and design flaws.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2024</p></details> |

(ii) We develop a diversity-optimized ensemble pruning algorithm to select the top-k sub-ensembles from a pool of $N$ base LLMs. Our pruning method recommends top-performing LLM subensembles of size $S$, often much smaller than $N$. (iii) We generate new output for each prompt query by utilizing a learn-to-ensemble approach, which learns to detect and resolve the output inconsistency among all component LLMs of an ensemble. Extensive evaluation on four different benchmarks shows good performance gain over the best LLM ensemble methods: (i) In constrained solution set problems, LLM-TOPLA outperforms the best-performing ensemble (Mixtral) by 2.2\% in accuracy on MMLU and the best-performing LLM ensemble (MoreAgent) on GSM8k by 2.1\%. (ii) In generative tasks, LLM-TOPLA outperforms the top-2 performers (Llama70b/Mixtral) on SearchQA by $3.9\mathrm{x}$ in F1, and on XSum by more than $38$ in ROUGE-1.

This centralization, coupled with the scarcity of high-quality training data and mounting complexity of maintaining comprehensive expertise across rapidly expanding knowledge domains, poses critical challenges to the continued growth of LLMs. While solutions like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offer potential remedies, maintaining up-to-date expert knowledge across diverse domains remains a significant challenge, particularly given the exponential growth of specialized information. This paper introduces LLMs Networks (LLM-Net), a blockchain-based framework that democratizes LLMs-as-a-Service through a decentralized network of specialized LLM providers. By leveraging collective computational resources and distributed domain expertise, LLM-Net incorporates fine-tuned expert models for various specific domains, ensuring sustained knowledge growth while maintaining service quality through collaborative prompting mechanisms. The framework's robust design includes blockchain technology for transparent transaction and performance validation, establishing an immutable record of service delivery. Our simulation, built on top of state-of-the-art LLMs such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1, Grok-2, and GPT-4o, validates the effectiveness of the reputation-based mechanism in maintaining service quality by selecting high-performing respondents (LLM providers). Thereby it demonstrates the potential of LLM-Net to sustain AI advancement through the integration of decentralized expertise and blockchain-based accountability.</p></details> | 8 pages |

While large language models (LLMs) like GPT, LLAMA, and Gemini are far from error-free, they have shown promise in answering a variety of questions outside of security. We studied LLM performance in the area of end user security by qualitatively evaluating 3 popular LLMs on 900 systematically collected end user security questions. While LLMs demonstrate broad generalist ``knowledge'' of end user security information, there are patterns of errors and limitations across LLMs consisting of stale and inaccurate answers, and indirect or unresponsive communication styles, all of which impacts the quality of information received. Based on these patterns, we suggest directions for model improvement and recommend user strategies for interacting with LLMs when seeking assistance with security.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 tables |

Mapping the Behavioral Biases of LLMs via Utility Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02784v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans are not homo economicus (i.e., rational economic beings). As humans, we exhibit systematic behavioral biases such as loss aversion, anchoring, framing, etc., which lead us to make suboptimal economic decisions. Insofar as such biases may be embedded in text data on which large language models (LLMs) are trained, to what extent are LLMs prone to the same behavioral biases? Understanding these biases in LLMs is crucial for deploying LLMs to support human decision-making. We propose utility theory-a paradigm at the core of modern economic theory-as an approach to evaluate the economic biases of LLMs. Utility theory enables the quantification and comparison of economic behavior against benchmarks such as perfect rationality or human behavior. To demonstrate our approach, we quantify and compare the economic behavior of a variety of open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that the economic behavior of current LLMs is neither entirely human-like nor entirely economicus-like. We also find that most current LLMs struggle to maintain consistent economic behavior across settings. Finally, we illustrate how our approach can measure the effect of interventions such as prompting on economic biases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |

However, since LLM's content generation process is hardly controllable, current LLM-based agents frequently generate invalid or non-executable plans, which jeopardizes the performance of the generated plans and corrupts users' trust in LLM-based agents. In response, this paper proposes a novel "Formal-LLM" framework for LLM-based agents by integrating the expressiveness of natural language and the precision of formal language. Specifically, the framework allows agent developers to express their requirements or constraints for the planning process as an automaton. A stack-based LLM plan generation process is then conducted under the supervision of the automaton to ensure that the generated plan satisfies the constraints, making the planning process controllable. We conduct experiments on both benchmark tasks and practical real-life tasks, and our framework achieves over 50% overall performance increase, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of employing Formal-LLM to guide the plan generation of agents, preventing the agents from generating invalid and unsuccessful plans. Further, more controllable LLM-based agents can facilitate the broader utilization of LLM in application scenarios where high validity of planning is essential.

Moreover, providing security to LLM-based systems is a great challenge, as both traditional threats to software applications and threats targeting LLMs and their integration must be mitigated. In this survey, we shed light on security and privacy concerns of such LLM-based systems by performing a systematic review and comprehensive categorization of threats and defensive strategies considering the entire software and LLM life cycles. We analyze real-world scenarios with distinct characteristics of LLM usage, spanning from development to operation. In addition, threats are classified according to their severity level and to which scenarios they pertain, facilitating the identification of the most relevant threats. Recommended defense strategies are systematically categorized and mapped to the corresponding life cycle phase and possible attack strategies they attenuate. This work paves the way for consumers and vendors to understand and efficiently mitigate risks during integration of LLMs in their respective solutions or organizations. It also enables the research community to benefit from the discussion of open challenges and edge cases that may hinder the secure and privacy-preserving adoption of LLM-based systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 8 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

These models predominantly map visual information into language representation space, leveraging the vast knowledge and powerful text generation abilities of LLMs to produce multimodal instruction-following responses. We could term this method as LLMs for Vision because of its employing LLMs for visual-language understanding, yet observe that these MLLMs neglect the potential of harnessing visual knowledge to enhance overall capabilities of LLMs, which could be regraded as Vision Enhancing LLMs. In this paper, we propose an approach called MKS2, aimed at enhancing LLMs through empowering Multimodal Knowledge Storage and Sharing in LLMs. Specifically, we introduce the Modular Visual Memory, a component integrated into the internal blocks of LLMs, designed to store open-world visual information efficiently. Additionally, we present a soft Mixtures-of-Multimodal Experts architecture in LLMs to invoke multimodal knowledge collaboration during generation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MKS2 substantially augments the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in contexts necessitating physical or commonsense knowledge. It also delivers competitive results on multimodal benchmarks.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

LLM-ARC employs an Actor-Critic method where the LLM Actor generates declarative logic programs along with tests for semantic correctness, while the Automated Reasoning Critic evaluates the code, runs the tests and provides feedback on test failures for iterative refinement. Implemented using Answer Set Programming (ASP), LLM-ARC achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 88.32% on the FOLIO benchmark which tests complex logical reasoning capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over LLM-only baselines, highlighting the importance of logic test generation and iterative self-refinement. We achieve our best result using a fully automated self-supervised training loop where the Actor is trained on end-to-end dialog traces with Critic feedback. We discuss potential enhancements and provide a detailed error analysis, showcasing the robustness and efficacy of LLM-ARC for complex natural language reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

LLM-I is designed to overcome the "one-tool" bottleneck of current unified models, which are limited to synthetic imagery and struggle with tasks requiring factual grounding or programmatic precision. Our framework empowers a central LLM or MLLM agent to intelligently orchestrate a diverse toolkit of specialized visual tools, including online image search, diffusion-based generation, code execution, and image editing. The agent is trained to select and apply these tools proficiently via a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that features a hybrid reward system combining rule-based logic with judgments from LLM and MLLM evaluators. Trained on a diverse new dataset using four different model backbones, LLM-I demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by a large margin across four benchmarks.

Our core insight is that pretrained, non-autoregressive generative LLMs, such as Diffusion LLMs, which model the joint distribution over prompt-response pairs, can serve as powerful surrogates for prompt search. This approach enables the direct conditional generation of prompts, effectively replacing costly, per-instance discrete optimization with a small number of parallelizable samples. We provide a probabilistic analysis demonstrating that under mild fidelity assumptions, only a few conditional samples are required to recover high-reward (harmful) prompts. Empirically, we find that the generated prompts are low-perplexity, diverse jailbreaks that exhibit strong transferability to a wide range of black-box target models, including robustly trained and proprietary LLMs. Beyond adversarial prompting, our framework opens new directions for red teaming, automated prompt optimization, and leveraging emerging Flow- and Diffusion-based LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small LLMs Are Weak Tool Learners: A Multi-LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07324v3)** | 2024-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents significantly extend the capabilities of standalone LLMs, empowering them to interact with external tools (e.g., APIs, functions) and complete various tasks in a self-directed fashion. The challenge of tool use demands that LLMs not only understand user queries and generate answers accurately but also excel in task planning, tool invocation, and result summarization. While traditional works focus on training a single LLM with all these capabilities, performance limitations become apparent, particularly with smaller models. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that decomposes the aforementioned capabilities into a planner, caller, and summarizer. Each component is implemented by a single LLM that focuses on a specific capability and collaborates with others to accomplish the task. This modular framework facilitates individual updates and the potential use of smaller LLMs for building each capability. To effectively train this framework, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm. First, we fine-tune a backbone LLM on the entire dataset without discriminating sub-tasks, providing the model with a comprehensive understanding of the task. Second, the fine-tuned LLM is used to instantiate the planner, caller, and summarizer respectively, which are continually fine-tuned on respective sub-tasks. Evaluation across various tool-use benchmarks illustrates that our proposed multi-LLM framework surpasses the traditional single-LLM approach, highlighting its efficacy and advantages in tool learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>On pr...</summary><p>On progress, github repo: https://github.com/X-PLUG/Multi-LLM-Agent</p></details> |

Despite progress in AI safety, current evaluations predominantly focus on adults, neglecting the unique vulnerabilities of minors engaging with generative AI. We introduce Safe-Child-LLM, a comprehensive benchmark and dataset for systematically assessing LLM safety across two developmental stages: children (7-12) and adolescents (13-17). Our framework includes a novel multi-part dataset of 200 adversarial prompts, curated from red-teaming corpora (e.g., SG-Bench, HarmBench), with human-annotated labels for jailbreak success and a standardized 0-5 ethical refusal scale. Evaluating leading LLMs -- including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, DeepSeek, Grok, Vicuna, and Mistral -- we uncover critical safety deficiencies in child-facing scenarios. This work highlights the need for community-driven benchmarks to protect young users in LLM interactions. To promote transparency and collaborative advancement in ethical AI development, we are publicly releasing both our benchmark datasets and evaluation codebase at https://github.com/The-Responsible-AI-Initiative/Safe_Child_LLM_Benchmark.git</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs' Classification Performance is Overclaimed](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16203v3)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many classification tasks designed for AI or human to solve, gold labels are typically included within the label space by default, often posed as "which of the following is correct?" This standard setup has traditionally highlighted the strong performance of advanced AI, particularly top-performing Large Language Models (LLMs), in routine classification tasks. However, when the gold label is intentionally excluded from the label space, it becomes evident that LLMs still attempt to select from the available label candidates, even when none are correct. This raises a pivotal question: Do LLMs truly demonstrate their intelligence in understanding the essence of classification tasks? In this study, we evaluate both closed-source and open-source LLMs across representative classification tasks, arguing that the perceived performance of LLMs is overstated due to their inability to exhibit the expected comprehension of the task. This paper makes a threefold contribution: i) To our knowledge, this is the first work to identify the limitations of LLMs in classification tasks when gold labels are absent. We define this task as Classify-w/o-Gold and propose it as a new testbed for LLMs. ii) We introduce a benchmark, Know-No, comprising two existing classification tasks and one new task, to evaluate Classify-w/o-Gold. iii) This work defines and advocates for a new evaluation metric, OmniAccuracy, which assesses LLMs' performance in classification tasks both when gold labels are present and absent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Showing LLM-Generated Code Selectively Based on Confidence of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03234v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in code generation, but they may generate erroneous programs. Reading a program takes ten times longer than writing it. Showing these erroneous programs to developers will waste developers' energies and introduce security risks to software. To address the above limitations, we propose HonestCoder, a novel LLM-based code generation approach. HonestCoder selectively shows the generated programs to developers based on LLMs' confidence. The confidence provides valuable insights into the correctness of generated programs. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel approach to estimate LLMs' confidence in code generation. It estimates confidence by measuring the multi-modal similarity between LLMs-generated programs. We collect and release a multilingual benchmark named TruthCodeBench, which consists of 2,265 samples and covers two popular programming languages (i.e., Python and Java). We apply HonestCoder to four popular LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-Coder and Code Llama) and evaluate it on TruthCodeBench. Based on the experiments, we obtain the following insights. (1) HonestCoder can effectively estimate LLMs' confidence and accurately determine the correctness of generated programs. For example, HonestCoder outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 27.79% in AUROC and 63.74% in AUCPR. (2) HonestCoder can decrease the number of erroneous programs shown to developers. Compared to eight baselines, it can show more correct programs and fewer erroneous programs to developers. (3) Compared to showing code indiscriminately, HonestCoder only adds slight time overhead (approximately 0.4 seconds per requirement). (4) We discuss future directions to facilitate the application of LLMs in software development. We hope this work can motivate broad discussions about measuring the reliability of LLMs' outputs in performing code-related tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the inference process for LLMs comes with significant computational costs. In this paper, we propose an efficient LLM inference pipeline that harnesses the power of LLMs. Our approach begins by tapping into the potential of LLMs to accurately perceive and predict the response length with minimal overhead. By leveraging this information, we introduce an efficient sequence scheduling technique that groups queries with similar response lengths into micro-batches. We evaluate our approach on real-world instruction datasets using the LLaMA-based model, and our results demonstrate an impressive 86% improvement in inference throughput without compromising effectiveness. Notably, our method is orthogonal to other inference acceleration techniques, making it a valuable addition to many existing toolkits (e.g., FlashAttention, Quantization) for LLM inference.</p></details> |  |

Notably, the disconnect between quantitative improvements on the overly academic leaderboard benchmarks and the qualitative impact of the models should be addressed. Furthermore, the benchmark suite is largely composed of translated versions of their English counterparts, which may not fully capture the intricacies of the Korean language. To address these issues, we propose Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2, an improved version of the earlier Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard. The original benchmarks are entirely replaced with new tasks that are more closely aligned with real-world capabilities. Additionally, four new native Korean benchmarks are introduced to better reflect the distinct characteristics of the Korean language. Through these refinements, Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2 seeks to provide a more meaningful evaluation for advancing Korean LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 Industry</p></details> |

While the research community has reasoned about SQL equivalence for decades, it poses considerable difficulties and no complete solutions exist. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capability in conversation, question answering and solving mathematics challenges. In this paper, we study if LLMs can be used to determine the equivalence between SQL queries under two notions of SQL equivalence (semantic equivalence and relaxed equivalence). To assist LLMs in generating high quality responses, we present two prompting techniques: Miniature & Mull and Explain & Compare. The former technique is used to evaluate the semantic equivalence in which it asks LLMs to execute a query on a simple database instance and then explore if a counterexample exists by modifying the database. The latter technique is used to evaluate the relaxed equivalence in which it asks LLMs to explain the queries and then compare if they contain significant logical differences. Our experiments demonstrate using our techniques, LLMs is a promising tool to help data engineers in writing semantically equivalent SQL queries, however challenges still persist, and is a better metric for evaluating SQL generation than the popular execution accuracy.</p></details> |  |

In response, services that optimize or suggest prompts have emerged. While such services can reduce user effort, they also introduce a risk: the prompt provider can subtly manipulate prompts to produce heavily biased LLM responses. In this work, we show that subtle synonym replacements in prompts can increase the likelihood (by a difference up to 78%) that LLMs mention a target concept (e.g., a brand, political party, nation). We substantiate our observations through a user study, showing that our adversarially perturbed prompts 1) are indistinguishable from unaltered prompts by humans, 2) push LLMs to recommend target concepts more often, and 3) make users more likely to notice target concepts, all without arousing suspicion. The practicality of this attack has the potential to undermine user autonomy. Among other measures, we recommend implementing warnings against using prompts from untrusted parties.</p></details> |  |

This study presents LLM-Mixer, a framework that improves forecasting accuracy through the combination of multiscale time-series decomposition with pre-trained LLMs (Large Language Models). LLM-Mixer captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends by decomposing the data into multiple temporal resolutions and processing them with a frozen LLM, guided by a textual prompt specifically designed for time-series data. Extensive experiments conducted on multivariate and univariate datasets demonstrate that LLM-Mixer achieves competitive performance, outperforming recent state-of-the-art models across various forecasting horizons. This work highlights the potential of combining multiscale analysis and LLMs for effective and scalable time-series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Time ...</summary><p>Time series forecasting using LLMs</p></details> |

However, generating the code which is deeply hardware-specific, architecture-aware, and performance-critical, especially for massively parallel GPUs, remains a complex challenge. In this work, we explore the use of LLMs for the automated generation and optimization of CUDA programs, with the goal of producing high-performance GPU kernels that fully exploit the underlying hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called \textbf{Feature Search and Reinforcement (FSR)}. FSR jointly optimizes compilation and functional correctness, as well as the runtime performance, which are validated through extensive and diverse test cases, and measured by actual kernel execution latency on the target GPU, respectively. This approach enables LLMs not only to generate syntactically and semantically correct CUDA code but also to iteratively refine it for efficiency, tailored to the characteristics of the GPU architecture. We evaluate FSR on representative CUDA kernels, covering AI workloads and computational intensive algorithms. Our results show that LLMs augmented with FSR consistently guarantee correctness rates. Meanwhile, the automatically generated kernels can outperform general human-written code by a factor of up to 179$\times$ in execution speeds. These findings highlight the potential of combining LLMs with performance reinforcement to automate GPU programming for hardware-specific, architecture-sensitive, and performance-critical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Grounded LLMs: Leveraging Graphical Function Calling to Minimize LLM Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10941v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly expanding across various tasks that involve inherent graphical structures. Graphs are integral to a wide range of applications, including motion planning for autonomous vehicles, social networks, scene understanding, and knowledge graphs. Many problems, even those not initially perceived as graph-based, can be effectively addressed through graph theory. However, when applied to these tasks, LLMs often encounter challenges, such as hallucinations and mathematical inaccuracies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph-Grounded LLMs, a system that improves LLM performance on graph-related tasks by integrating a graph library through function calls. By grounding LLMs in this manner, we demonstrate significant reductions in hallucinations and improved mathematical accuracy in solving graph-based problems, as evidenced by the performance on the NLGraph benchmark. Finally, we showcase a disaster rescue application where the Graph-Grounded LLM acts as a decision-support system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gauging Overprecision in LLMs: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12098v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, overconfidence in large language models (LLMs) has garnered considerable attention due to its fundamental importance in quantifying the trustworthiness of LLM generation. However, existing approaches prompt the \textit{black box LLMs} to produce their confidence (\textit{verbalized confidence}), which can be subject to many biases and hallucinations. Inspired by a different aspect of overconfidence in cognitive science called \textit{overprecision}, we designed a framework for its study in black box LLMs. This framework contains three main phases: 1) generation, 2) refinement and 3) evaluation. In the generation phase we prompt the LLM to generate answers to numerical questions in the form of intervals with a certain level of confidence. This confidence level is imposed in the prompt and not required for the LLM to generate as in previous approaches. We use various prompting techniques and use the same prompt multiple times to gauge the effects of randomness in the generation process. In the refinement phase, answers from the previous phase are refined to generate better answers. The LLM answers are evaluated and studied in the evaluation phase to understand its internal workings. This study allowed us to gain various insights into LLM overprecision: 1) LLMs are highly uncalibrated for numerical tasks 2) there is no correlation between the length of the interval and the imposed confidence level, which can be symptomatic of a a) lack of understanding of the concept of confidence or b) inability to adjust self-confidence by following instructions, {3) LLM numerical precision differs depending on the task, scale of answer and prompting technique 4) Refinement of answers doesn't improve precision in most cases. We believe this study offers new perspectives on LLM overconfidence and serves as a strong baseline for overprecision in LLMs.</p></details> | 16 pages |

To-date, however, there has been little understanding of LLMs' uptake in HCI. We address this gap via a systematic literature review of 153 CHI papers from 2020-24 that engage with LLMs. We taxonomize: (1) domains where LLMs are applied; (2) roles of LLMs in HCI projects; (3) contribution types; and (4) acknowledged limitations and risks. We find LLM work in 10 diverse domains, primarily via empirical and artifact contributions. Authors use LLMs in five distinct roles, including as research tools or simulated users. Still, authors often raise validity and reproducibility concerns, and overwhelmingly study closed models. We outline opportunities to improve HCI research with and on LLMs, and provide guiding questions for researchers to consider the validity and appropriateness of LLM-related work.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint version of the paper conditionally accepted to CHI'25</p></details> |

While these methods can work within the distributions tested, they are neither robust nor predictable. This limitation can be addressed through compound LLM architectures where LLMs work in conjunction with other components to ensure reliability. In this paper, we present a technical evaluation of a compound LLM architecture--the LLM-Modulo framework. In this framework, an LLM is paired with a complete set of sound verifiers that validate its output, re-prompting it if it fails. This approach ensures that the system can never output any fallacious output, and therefore that every output generated is guaranteed correct--something previous techniques have not been able to claim. Our results, evaluated across four scheduling domains, demonstrate significant performance gains with the LLM-Modulo framework using various models. Additionally, we explore modifications to the base configuration of the framework and assess their impact on overall system performance.</p></details> |  |

While test collections have become an integral part of IR research, the process of data creation involves significant manual-annotation effort, which often makes it very expensive and time-consuming. Consequently, test collections can become too small when the budget is limited, which may lead to unstable evaluations. As a cheaper alternative, recent studies have proposed using large language models (LLMs) to completely replace human assessors. However, while LLMs correlate to some extent with human judgments, their predictions are not perfect and often show bias. Thus, a complete replacement with LLMs is considered too risky and not fully reliable. In this paper, we propose LLM-Assisted Relevance Assessments (LARA), an effective method to balance manual annotations with LLM annotations, helping build a rich and reliable test collection even under a low budget. We use the LLM's predicted relevance probabilities to select the most profitable documents for manual annotation under a budget constraint. Guided by theoretical reasoning, LARA actively learns to calibrate the LLM's predicted relevance probabilities, directing the human-annotation process. Then, using the calibration model learned from the limited manual annotations, LARA debiases the LLM predictions to annotate the remaining non-assessed data. Experiments on TREC-7 Ad Hoc, TREC-8 Ad Hoc, TREC Robust 2004, and TREC-COVID datasets show that LARA outperforms alternative solutions under almost any budget constraint. While the community debates humans versus LLMs in relevance assessments, we contend that, given the same amount of human effort, it is reasonable to leverage LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages.

The most widely used integration paradigm projects the audio encoder output tokens into the LLM input space (e.g., via an MLP or a Q-Former), then prepends or inserts them to the text tokens. We refer to this generic scheme as Prepend to the LLM's input token space (PLITS) integration. We propose an efficient alternative, Lightweight Audio LLM Integration (LAL). LAL introduces audio representations solely via the attention mechanism within different layers of the LLM, bypassing its feedforward module. LAL encodes rich audio semantics at an appropriate level of abstraction for integration into different blocks of LLMs. Our design significantly reduces computational overhead compared to existing integration approaches. Observing with Whisper that the speech encoder benefits from PLITS integration, we propose an audio encoder aware approach for efficiently Probing Audio encoders via LLM (PAL), which employs PLITS integration for Whisper and LAL for general audio encoders. Under an identical training curriculum, LAL consistently maintains performance or outperforms existing integration approaches across multiple base LLMs and tasks. For general audio tasks, LAL improvement is up to 30% over a strong PLITS baseline while reducing memory usage by up to 64.1% and increasing throughput by up to 247.5%. Furthermore, for general audio-music-speech LLM, PAL performs on par with a fully PLITS integration-based system but with substantially improved computational and memory efficiency.

However, deploying these models introduces critical risks related to intellectual property violations and potential misuse, particularly as adversaries can imitate these models to steal services or generate misleading outputs. We specifically focus on model stealing attacks, as they are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and pose a serious threat to their security, revenue, and ethical deployment. While various watermarking techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, it remains unclear how far the community and industry have progressed in developing and deploying watermarks in LLMs. To bridge this gap, we aim to develop a comprehensive systematization for watermarks in LLMs by 1) presenting a detailed taxonomy for watermarks in LLMs, 2) proposing a novel intellectual property classifier to explore the effectiveness and impacts of watermarks on LLMs under both attack and attack-free environments, 3) analyzing the limitations of existing watermarks in LLMs, and 4) discussing practical challenges and potential future directions for watermarks in LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we show that despite promising research outcomes and significant attention from leading companies and community to deploy watermarks, these techniques have yet to reach their full potential in real-world applications due to their unfavorable impacts on model utility of LLMs and downstream tasks. Our findings provide an insightful understanding of watermarks in LLMs, highlighting the need for practical watermarks solutions tailored to LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

While previous studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review, their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent, which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand, revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study this issue from a venture capital perspective by predicting idea-stage startup success based on founder traits. (i) To build a reliable prediction model, we introduce LLM-AR, a pipeline inspired by neural-symbolic systems that distils LLM-generated heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog automated-reasoning engine. (ii) An iterative policy-evolution loop incorporates association-rule mining to progressively refine the prediction rules. On unseen folds, LLM-AR achieves 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall, 5.9x the random baseline precision, while exposing every decision path for human inspection. The framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters, showing promise to extend into other domains.</p></details> |  |

Aligning LLM-Assisted Evaluation of LLM Outputs with Human Preferences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12272v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the cumbersome nature of human evaluation and limitations of code-based evaluation, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to assist humans in evaluating LLM outputs. Yet LLM-generated evaluators simply inherit all the problems of the LLMs they evaluate, requiring further human validation. We present a mixed-initiative approach to ``validate the validators'' -- aligning LLM-generated evaluation functions (be it prompts or code) with human requirements. Our interface, EvalGen, provides automated assistance to users in generating evaluation criteria and implementing assertions. While generating candidate implementations (Python functions, LLM grader prompts), EvalGen asks humans to grade a subset of LLM outputs; this feedback is used to select implementations that better align with user grades. A qualitative study finds overall support for EvalGen but underscores the subjectivity and iterative process of alignment. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we dub \emph{criteria drift}: users need criteria to grade outputs, but grading outputs helps users define criteria. What is more, some criteria appears \emph{dependent} on the specific LLM outputs observed (rather than independent criteria that can be defined \emph{a priori}), raising serious questions for approaches that assume the independence of evaluation from observation of model outputs. We present our interface and implementation details, a comparison of our algorithm with a baseline approach, and implications for the design of future LLM evaluation assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However traditional ML methods have limitations on generalizability (adapting to different scenarios) and inference ability (understanding the context). Fortunately, large language models (LLMs) have shown high generalizability and human-competitive abilities in understanding context, which are promising for data management tasks (e.g., database diagnosis, database tuning). However, existing LLMs have several limitations: hallucination, high cost, and low accuracy for complicated tasks. To address these challenges, we design LLMDB, an LLM-enhanced data management paradigm which has generalizability and high inference ability while avoiding hallucination, reducing LLM cost, and achieving high accuracy. LLMDB embeds domain-specific knowledge to avoid hallucination by LLM fine-tuning and prompt engineering. LLMDB reduces the high cost of LLMs by vector databases which provide semantic search and caching abilities. LLMDB improves the task accuracy by LLM agent which provides multiple-round inference and pipeline executions. We showcase three real-world scenarios that LLMDB can well support, including query rewrite, database diagnosis and data analytics. We also summarize the open research challenges of LLMDB.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tag-LLM: Repurposing General-Purpose LLMs for Specialized Domains](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05140v3)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating natural language. However, their capabilities wane in highly specialized domains underrepresented in the pretraining corpus, such as physical and biomedical sciences. This work explores how to repurpose general LLMs into effective task solvers for specialized domains. We introduce a novel, model-agnostic framework for learning custom input tags, which are parameterized as continuous vectors appended to the LLM's embedding layer, to condition the LLM. We design two types of input tags: domain tags are used to delimit specialized representations (e.g., chemical formulas) and provide domain-relevant context; function tags are used to represent specific functions (e.g., predicting molecular properties) and compress function-solving instructions. We develop a three-stage protocol to learn these tags using auxiliary data and domain knowledge. By explicitly disentangling task domains from task functions, our method enables zero-shot generalization to unseen problems through diverse combinations of the input tags. It also boosts LLM's performance in various specialized domains, such as predicting protein or chemical properties and modeling drug-target interactions, outperforming expert models tailored to these tasks.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

To address these limitations, we propose an LLM-in-the-loop (LLM-ITL) intent clustering framework, integrating the language understanding capabilities of LLMs into conventional clustering algorithms. Specifically, this paper (1) examines the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs in semantic coherence evaluation and intent cluster naming, achieving over 95% accuracy aligned with human judgments; (2) designs an LLM-ITL framework that facilitates the iterative discovery of coherent intent clusters and the optimal number of clusters; and (3) introduces context-aware techniques tailored for customer service dialogue. Since existing English benchmarks lack sufficient semantic diversity and intent coverage, we further present a comprehensive Chinese dialogue intent dataset comprising over 100k real customer service calls with 1,507 human-annotated clusters. The proposed approaches significantly outperform LLM-guided baselines, achieving notable improvements in clustering quality, cost efficiency, and downstream applications. Combined with several best practices, our findings highlight the prominence of LLM-in-the-loop techniques for scalable dialogue data mining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

| **[Factor Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00554v1)** | 2019-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the successful deep neural network architectures are structured, often consisting of elements like convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent neural networks. Recently, graph neural networks have been successfully applied to graph structured data such as point cloud and molecular data. These networks often only consider pairwise dependencies, as they operate on a graph structure. We generalize the graph neural network into a factor graph neural network (FGNN) in order to capture higher order dependencies. We show that FGNN is able to represent Max-Product Belief Propagation, an approximate inference algorithm on probabilistic graphical models; hence it is able to do well when Max-Product does well. Promising results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Graph Machines: Learning Neural Networks Using Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04818v1)** | 2017-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Label propagation is a powerful and flexible semi-supervised learning technique on graphs. Neural networks, on the other hand, have proven track records in many supervised learning tasks. In this work, we propose a training framework with a graph-regularised objective, namely "Neural Graph Machines", that can combine the power of neural networks and label propagation. This work generalises previous literature on graph-augmented training of neural networks, enabling it to be applied to multiple neural architectures (Feed-forward NNs, CNNs and LSTM RNNs) and a wide range of graphs. The new objective allows the neural networks to harness both labeled and unlabeled data by: (a) allowing the network to train using labeled data as in the supervised setting, (b) biasing the network to learn similar hidden representations for neighboring nodes on a graph, in the same vein as label propagation. Such architectures with the proposed objective can be trained efficiently using stochastic gradient descent and scaled to large graphs, with a runtime that is linear in the number of edges. The proposed joint training approach convincingly outperforms many existing methods on a wide range of tasks (multi-label classification on social graphs, news categorization, document classification and semantic intent classification), with multiple forms of graph inputs (including graphs with and without node-level features) and using different types of neural networks.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Learning Equivariant Representations of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12143v3)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks that process the parameters of other neural networks find applications in domains as diverse as classifying implicit neural representations, generating neural network weights, and predicting generalization errors. However, existing approaches either overlook the inherent permutation symmetry in the neural network or rely on intricate weight-sharing patterns to achieve equivariance, while ignoring the impact of the network architecture itself. In this work, we propose to represent neural networks as computational graphs of parameters, which allows us to harness powerful graph neural networks and transformers that preserve permutation symmetry. Consequently, our approach enables a single model to encode neural computational graphs with diverse architectures. We showcase the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of tasks, including classification and editing of implicit neural representations, predicting generalization performance, and learning to optimize, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Neural networks, inspired by biological systems, are widely used for tasks such as pattern recognition, data classification, and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a well-established framework, have recently been extended to Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs), with their properties and applications being actively studied. The Plithogenic Graph framework enhances graph representations by integrating multi-valued attributes, as well as membership and contradiction functions, enabling the detailed modeling of complex relationships. In the context of handling uncertainty, concepts such as Fuzzy Graphs and Neutrosophic Graphs have gained prominence. It is well established that Plithogenic Graphs serve as a generalization of both Fuzzy Graphs and Neutrosophic Graphs. Furthermore, the Fuzzy Graph Neural Network has been proposed and is an active area of research. This paper establishes the theoretical foundation for the development of SuperHyperGraph Neural Networks (SHGNNs) and Plithogenic Graph Neural Networks, expanding the applicability of neural networks to these advanced graph structures. While mathematical generalizations and proofs are presented, future computational experiments are anticipated.</p></details> | 77 pages; 3 figures |
| **[Graph Structure of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06559v2)** | 2020-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks are often represented as graphs of connections between neurons. However, despite their wide use, there is currently little understanding of the relationship between the graph structure of the neural network and its predictive performance. Here we systematically investigate how does the graph structure of neural networks affect their predictive performance. To this end, we develop a novel graph-based representation of neural networks called relational graph, where layers of neural network computation correspond to rounds of message exchange along the graph structure. Using this representation we show that: (1) a "sweet spot" of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance; (2) neural network's performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph; (3) our findings are consistent across many different tasks and datasets; (4) the sweet spot can be identified efficiently; (5) top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly similar to those of real biological neural networks. Our work opens new directions for the design of neural architectures and the understanding on neural networks in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2020, with open-source code</p></details> |
| **[Customized Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12386v2)** | 2021-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have greatly advanced the task of graph classification. Typically, we first build a unified GNN model with graphs in a given training set and then use this unified model to predict labels of all the unseen graphs in the test set. However, graphs in the same dataset often have dramatically distinct structures, which indicates that a unified model may be sub-optimal given an individual graph. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to develop customized graph neural networks for graph classification. Specifically, we propose a novel customized graph neural network framework, i.e., Customized-GNN. Given a graph sample, Customized-GNN can generate a sample-specific model for this graph based on its structure. Meanwhile, the proposed framework is very general that can be applied to numerous existing graph neural network models. Comprehensive experiments on various graph classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Small Graph and Giant Network Representation Learning: An Overview](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00187v1)** | 2019-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks denote a group of neural network models introduced for the representation learning tasks on graph data specifically. Graph neural networks have been demonstrated to be effective for capturing network structure information, and the learned representations can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on node and graph classification tasks. Besides the different application scenarios, the architectures of graph neural network models also depend on the studied graph types a lot. Graph data studied in research can be generally categorized into two main types, i.e., small graphs vs. giant networks, which differ from each other a lot in the size, instance number and label annotation. Several different types of graph neural network models have been introduced for learning the representations from such different types of graphs already. In this paper, for these two different types of graph data, we will introduce the graph neural networks introduced in recent years. To be more specific, the graph neural networks introduced in this paper include IsoNN, SDBN, LF&ER, GCN, GAT, DifNN, GNL, GraphSage and seGEN. Among these graph neural network models, IsoNN, SDBN and LF&ER are initially proposed for small graphs and the remaining ones are initially proposed for giant networks instead.

| **[On Node Features for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08795v1)** | 2019-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network (GNN) is a deep model for graph representation learning. One advantage of graph neural network is its ability to incorporate node features into the learning process. However, this prevents graph neural network from being applied into featureless graphs. In this paper, we first analyze the effects of node features on the performance of graph neural network. We show that GNNs work well if there is a strong correlation between node features and node labels. Based on these results, we propose new feature initialization methods that allows to apply graph neural network to non-attributed graphs. Our experimental results show that the artificial features are highly competitive with real features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Processes: Towards Bayesian Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10042v2)** | 2019-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Graph Neural Processes (GNP), inspired by the recent work in conditional and latent neural processes. A Graph Neural Process is defined as a Conditional Neural Process that operates on arbitrary graph data. It takes features of sparsely observed context points as input, and outputs a distribution over target points. We demonstrate graph neural processes in edge imputation and discuss benefits and drawbacks of the method for other application areas. One major benefit of GNPs is the ability to quantify uncertainty in deep learning on graph structures. An additional benefit of this method is the ability to extend graph neural networks to inputs of dynamic sized graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10569v2)** | 2023-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks have gained huge interest in the past few years. These powerful algorithms expanded deep learning models to non-Euclidean space and were able to achieve state of art performance in various applications including recommender systems and social networks. However, this performance is based on static graph structures assumption which limits the Graph Neural Networks performance when the data varies with time. Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks are extension of Graph Neural Networks that takes the time factor into account. Recently, various Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network algorithms were proposed and achieved superior performance compared to other deep learning algorithms in several time dependent applications. This survey discusses interesting topics related to Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks, including algorithms, applications, and open challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks: Taxonomy, Advances and Trends](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08752v4)** | 2022-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks provide a powerful toolkit for embedding real-world graphs into low-dimensional spaces according to specific tasks. Up to now, there have been several surveys on this topic. However, they usually lay emphasis on different angles so that the readers can not see a panorama of the graph neural networks. This survey aims to overcome this limitation, and provide a comprehensive review on the graph neural networks. First of all, we provide a novel taxonomy for the graph neural networks, and then refer to up to 400 relevant literatures to show the panorama of the graph neural networks. All of them are classified into the corresponding categories. In order to drive the graph neural networks into a new stage, we summarize four future research directions so as to overcome the facing challenges. It is expected that more and more scholars can understand and exploit the graph neural networks, and use them in their research community.</p></details> | 55 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Graph Coordinates and Conventional Neural Networks -- An Alternative for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01342v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based data present unique challenges and opportunities for machine learning. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and especially those algorithms that capture graph topology through message passing for neighborhood aggregation, have been a leading solution. However, these networks often require substantial computational resources and may not optimally leverage the information contained in the graph's topology, particularly for large-scale or complex graphs. We propose Topology Coordinate Neural Network (TCNN) and Directional Virtual Coordinate Neural Network (DVCNN) as novel and efficient alternatives to message passing GNNs, that directly leverage the graph's topology, sidestepping the computational challenges presented by competing algorithms. Our proposed methods can be viewed as a reprise of classic techniques for graph embedding for neural network feature engineering, but they are novel in that our embedding techniques leverage ideas in Graph Coordinates (GC) that are lacking in current practice. Experimental results, benchmarked against the Open Graph Benchmark Leaderboard, demonstrate that TCNN and DVCNN achieve competitive or superior performance to message passing GNNs. For similar levels of accuracy and ROC-AUC, TCNN and DVCNN need far fewer trainable parameters than contenders of the OGBN Leaderboard. The proposed TCNN architecture requires fewer parameters than any neural network method currently listed in the OGBN Leaderboard for both OGBN-Proteins and OGBN-Products datasets. Conversely, our methods achieve higher performance for a similar number of trainable parameters. By providing an efficient and effective alternative to message passing GNNs, our work expands the toolbox of techniques for graph-based machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted and will be published on Big Data Conference 2023, Data-driven Science for Graphs: Algorithms, Architectures, and Application workshop</p></details> |

Along with this general class of ansatze, we introduce further specialized architectures, namely, Quantum Graph Recurrent Neural Networks (QGRNN) and Quantum Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (QGCNN). We provide four example applications of QGNNs: learning Hamiltonian dynamics of quantum systems, learning how to create multipartite entanglement in a quantum network, unsupervised learning for spectral clustering, and supervised learning for graph isomorphism classification.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Inferring the Graph Structure of Images for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04677v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image datasets such as MNIST are a key benchmark for testing Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures. The images are traditionally represented as a grid graph with each node representing a pixel and edges connecting neighboring pixels (vertically and horizontally). The graph signal is the values (intensities) of each pixel in the image. The graphs are commonly used as input to graph neural networks (e.g., Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (Graph CNNs) [1, 2], Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [3], GatedGCN [4]) to classify the images. In this work, we improve the accuracy of downstream graph neural network tasks by finding alternative graphs to the grid graph and superpixel methods to represent the dataset images, following the approach in [5, 6]. We find row correlation, column correlation, and product graphs for each image in MNIST and Fashion-MNIST using correlations between the pixel values building on the method in [5, 6]. Experiments show that using these different graph representations and features as input into downstream GNN models improves the accuracy over using the traditional grid graph and superpixel methods in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Rewriting for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18632v1)** | 2023-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given graphs as input, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) support the inference of nodes, edges, attributes, or graph properties. Graph Rewriting investigates the rule-based manipulation of graphs to model complex graph transformations. We propose that, therefore, (i) graph rewriting subsumes GNNs and could serve as formal model to study and compare them, and (ii) the representation of GNNs as graph rewrite systems can help to design and analyse GNNs, their architectures and algorithms. Hence we propose Graph Rewriting Neural Networks (GReNN) as both novel semantic foundation and engineering discipline for GNNs. We develop a case study reminiscent of a Message Passing Neural Network realised as a Groove graph rewriting model and explore its incremental operation in response to dynamic updates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Origi...</summary><p>Originally submitted to ICGT 2023, part of STAF Conferences</p></details> |
| **[Graph in Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00696v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited to process graphs each of whose vertices is represented by a vector or a single value, limited their representing capability to describe complex objects. In this paper, we propose the first GNN (called Graph in Graph Neural (GIG) Network) which can process graph-style data (called GIG sample) whose vertices are further represented by graphs. Given a set of graphs or a data sample whose components can be represented by a set of graphs (called multi-graph data sample), our GIG network starts with a GIG sample generation (GSG) module which encodes the input as a \textbf{GIG sample}, where each GIG vertex includes a graph. Then, a set of GIG hidden layers are stacked, with each consisting of: (1) a GIG vertex-level updating (GVU) module that individually updates the graph in every GIG vertex based on its internal information; and (2) a global-level GIG sample updating (GGU) module that updates graphs in all GIG vertices based on their relationships, making the updated GIG vertices become global context-aware. This way, both internal cues within the graph contained in each GIG vertex and the relationships among GIG vertices could be utilized for down-stream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our GIG network generalizes well for not only various generic graph analysis tasks but also real-world multi-graph data analysis (e.g., human skeleton video-based action recognition), which achieved the new state-of-the-art results on 13 out of 14 evaluated datasets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/wangjs96/Graph-in-Graph-Neural-Network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streaming Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.10627v2)** | 2018-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are essential representations of many real-world data such as social networks. Recent years have witnessed the increasing efforts made to extend the neural network models to graph-structured data. These methods, which are usually known as the graph neural networks, have been applied to advance many graphs related tasks such as reasoning dynamics of the physical system, graph classification, and node classification. Most of the existing graph neural network models have been designed for static graphs, while many real-world graphs are inherently dynamic. For example, social networks are naturally evolving as new users joining and new relations being created. Current graph neural network models cannot utilize the dynamic information in dynamic graphs. However, the dynamic information has been proven to enhance the performance of many graph analytic tasks such as community detection and link prediction. Hence, it is necessary to design dedicated graph neural networks for dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DGNN, a new {\bf D}ynamic {\bf G}raph {\bf N}eural {\bf N}etwork model, which can model the dynamic information as the graph evolving. In particular, the proposed framework can keep updating node information by capturing the sequential information of edges (interactions), the time intervals between edges and information propagation coherently. Experimental results on various dynamic graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

It combines the strength of the traditional simulated method of moments (SMM) and recent machine learning techniques -- Graph Neural Network (GNN). It outperforms existing reduced-form methods with network centrality measures in prediction accuracy. The method can be used on networks with any structure, allowing for heterogeneity among both traders and assets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Enhanced Graph Neural Networks for Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15487v3)** | 2023-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data is omnipresent and has a wide variety of applications, such as in natural science, social networks, or the semantic web. However, while being rich in information, graphs are often noisy and incomplete. As a result, graph completion tasks, such as node classification or link prediction, have gained attention. On one hand, neural methods, such as graph neural networks, have proven to be robust tools for learning rich representations of noisy graphs. On the other hand, symbolic methods enable exact reasoning on graphs.We propose Knowledge Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (KeGNN), a neuro-symbolic framework for graph completion that combines both paradigms as it allows for the integration of prior knowledge into a graph neural network model.Essentially, KeGNN consists of a graph neural network as a base upon which knowledge enhancement layers are stacked with the goal of refining predictions with respect to prior knowledge.We instantiate KeGNN in conjunction with two state-of-the-art graph neural networks, Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks, and evaluate KeGNN on multiple benchmark datasets for node classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Wavelet Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07785v1)** | 2019-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present graph wavelet neural network (GWNN), a novel graph convolutional neural network (CNN), leveraging graph wavelet transform to address the shortcomings of previous spectral graph CNN methods that depend on graph Fourier transform. Different from graph Fourier transform, graph wavelet transform can be obtained via a fast algorithm without requiring matrix eigendecomposition with high computational cost. Moreover, graph wavelets are sparse and localized in vertex domain, offering high efficiency and good interpretability for graph convolution. The proposed GWNN significantly outperforms previous spectral graph CNNs in the task of graph-based semi-supervised classification on three benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binarized Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11147v1)** | 2021-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there have been some breakthroughs in graph analysis by applying the graph neural networks (GNNs) following a neighborhood aggregation scheme, which demonstrate outstanding performance in many tasks. However, we observe that the parameters of the network and the embedding of nodes are represented in real-valued matrices in existing GNN-based graph embedding approaches which may limit the efficiency and scalability of these models. It is well-known that binary vector is usually much more space and time efficient than the real-valued vector. This motivates us to develop a binarized graph neural network to learn the binary representations of the nodes with binary network parameters following the GNN-based paradigm. Our proposed method can be seamlessly integrated into the existing GNN-based embedding approaches to binarize the model parameters and learn the compact embedding. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed binarized graph neural network, namely BGN, is orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of both time and space while matching the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03388v2)** | 2021-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the recent years, Graph Neural Networks have become increasingly popular in network analytic and beyond. With that, their architecture noticeable diverges from the classical multi-layered hierarchical organization of the traditional neural networks. At the same time, many conventional approaches in network science efficiently utilize the hierarchical approaches to account for the hierarchical organization of the networks, and recent works emphasize their critical importance. This paper aims to connect the dots between the traditional Neural Network and the Graph Neural Network architectures as well as the network science approaches, harnessing the power of the hierarchical network organization. A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network architecture is proposed, supplementing the original input network layer with the hierarchy of auxiliary network layers and organizing the computational scheme updating the node features through both - horizontal network connections within each layer as well as the vertical connection between the layers. It enables simultaneous learning of the individual node features along with the aggregated network features at variable resolution and uses them to improve the convergence and stability of the individual node feature learning. The proposed Hierarchical Graph Neural network architecture is successfully evaluated on the network embedding and modeling as well as network classification, node labeling, and community tasks and demonstrates increased efficiency in those.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Learning the Network of Graphs for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03907v1)** | 2022-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in many scenarios with graph-structured data. However, in many real applications, there are three issues when applying GNNs: graphs are unknown, nodes have noisy features, and graphs contain noisy connections. Aiming at solving these problems, we propose a new graph neural network named as GL-GNN. Our model includes multiple sub-modules, each sub-module selects important data features and learn the corresponding key relation graph of data samples when graphs are unknown. GL-GNN further obtains the network of graphs by learning the network of sub-modules. The learned graphs are further fused using an aggregation method over the network of graphs. Our model solves the first issue by simultaneously learning multiple relation graphs of data samples as well as a relation network of graphs, and solves the second and the third issue by selecting important data features as well as important data sample relations. We compare our method with 14 baseline methods on seven datasets when the graph is unknown and 11 baseline methods on two datasets when the graph is known. The results show that our method achieves better accuracies than the baseline methods and is capable of selecting important features and graph edges from the dataset.

| **[On the choice of graph neural network architectures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05384v2)** | 2020-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seminal works on graph neural networks have primarily targeted semi-supervised node classification problems with few observed labels and high-dimensional signals. With the development of graph networks, this setup has become a de facto benchmark for a significant body of research. Interestingly, several works have recently shown that in this particular setting, graph neural networks do not perform much better than predefined low-pass filters followed by a linear classifier. However, when learning from little data in a high-dimensional space, it is not surprising that simple and heavily regularized methods are near-optimal. In this paper, we show empirically that in settings with fewer features and more training data, more complex graph networks significantly outperform simple models, and propose a few insights towards the proper choice of graph network architectures. We finally outline the importance of using sufficiently diverse benchmarks (including lower dimensional signals as well) when designing and studying new types of graph neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, accepted at ICASSP 2020</p></details> |

Most existing research focuses on using graph neural networks to solve homophilous problems, but little attention has been paid to heterophily-type problems. In this paper, we propose a graph network model for graph coloring, which is a class of representative heterophilous problems. Different from the conventional graph networks, we introduce negative message passing into the proposed graph neural network for more effective information exchange in handling graph coloring problems. Moreover, a new loss function taking into account the self-information of the nodes is suggested to accelerate the learning process.

| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00596v4)** | 2020-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years, ranging from image classification and video processing to speech recognition and natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into four categories, namely recurrent graph neural networks, convolutional graph neural networks, graph autoencoders, and spatial-temporal graph neural networks. We further discuss the applications of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of graph neural networks. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor revision (updated tables and references)</p></details> |
| **[Continuous Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00967v3)** | 2020-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper builds on the connection between graph neural networks and traditional dynamical systems. We propose continuous graph neural networks (CGNN), which generalise existing graph neural networks with discrete dynamics in that they can be viewed as a specific discretisation scheme. The key idea is how to characterise the continuous dynamics of node representations, i.e. the derivatives of node representations, w.r.t. time. Inspired by existing diffusion-based methods on graphs (e.g. PageRank and epidemic models on social networks), we define the derivatives as a combination of the current node representations, the representations of neighbors, and the initial values of the nodes. We propose and analyse two possible dynamics on graphs---including each dimension of node representations (a.k.a. the feature channel) change independently or interact with each other---both with theoretical justification. The proposed continuous graph neural networks are robust to over-smoothing and hence allow us to build deeper networks, which in turn are able to capture the long-range dependencies between nodes. Experimental results on the task of node classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach over competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[EdgeNets:Edge Varying Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07620v3)** | 2021-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by the outstanding performance of neural networks in the structured Euclidean domain, recent years have seen a surge of interest in developing neural networks for graphs and data supported on graphs. The graph is leveraged at each layer of the neural network as a parameterization to capture detail at the node level with a reduced number of parameters and computational complexity. Following this rationale, this paper puts forth a general framework that unifies state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNNs) through the concept of EdgeNet. An EdgeNet is a GNN architecture that allows different nodes to use different parameters to weigh the information of different neighbors. By extrapolating this strategy to more iterations between neighboring nodes, the EdgeNet learns edge- and neighbor-dependent weights to capture local detail. This is a general linear and local operation that a node can perform and encompasses under one formulation all existing graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) as well as graph attention networks (GATs). In writing different GNN architectures with a common language, EdgeNets highlight specific architecture advantages and limitations, while providing guidelines to improve their capacity without compromising their local implementation. An interesting conclusion is the unification of GCNNs and GATs -- approaches that have been so far perceived as separate. In particular, we show that GATs are GCNNs on a graph that is learned from the features. This particularization opens the doors to develop alternative attention mechanisms for improving discriminatory power.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binary Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.15823v2)** | 2021-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful and flexible framework for representation learning on irregular data. As they generalize the operations of classical CNNs on grids to arbitrary topologies, GNNs also bring much of the implementation challenges of their Euclidean counterparts. Model size, memory footprint, and energy consumption are common concerns for many real-world applications. Network binarization allocates a single bit to parameters and activations, thus dramatically reducing the memory requirements (up to 32x compared to single-precision floating-point numbers) and maximizing the benefits of fast SIMD instructions on modern hardware for measurable speedups. However, in spite of the large body of work on binarization for classical CNNs, this area remains largely unexplored in geometric deep learning. In this paper, we present and evaluate different strategies for the binarization of graph neural networks. We show that through careful design of the models, and control of the training process, binary graph neural networks can be trained at only a moderate cost in accuracy on challenging benchmarks. In particular, we present the first dynamic graph neural network in Hamming space, able to leverage efficient k-NN search on binary vectors to speed-up the construction of the dynamic graph. We further verify that the binary models offer significant savings on embedded devices. Our code is publicly available on Github.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2021 Camera-Ready Version</p></details> |
| **[Graph Unrolling Networks: Interpretable Neural Networks for Graph Signal Denoising](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01301v1)** | 2021-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an interpretable graph neural network framework to denoise single or multiple noisy graph signals. The proposed graph unrolling networks expand algorithm unrolling to the graph domain and provide an interpretation of the architecture design from a signal processing perspective. We unroll an iterative denoising algorithm by mapping each iteration into a single network layer where the feed-forward process is equivalent to iteratively denoising graph signals. We train the graph unrolling networks through unsupervised learning, where the input noisy graph signals are used to supervise the networks. By leveraging the learning ability of neural networks, we adaptively capture appropriate priors from input noisy graph signals, instead of manually choosing signal priors. A core component of graph unrolling networks is the edge-weight-sharing graph convolution operation, which parameterizes each edge weight by a trainable kernel function where the trainable parameters are shared by all the edges. The proposed convolution is permutation-equivariant and can flexibly adjust the edge weights to various graph signals. We then consider two special cases of this class of networks, graph unrolling sparse coding (GUSC) and graph unrolling trend filtering (GUTF), by unrolling sparse coding and trend filtering, respectively. To validate the proposed methods, we conduct extensive experiments on both real-world datasets and simulated datasets, and demonstrate that our methods have smaller denoising errors than conventional denoising algorithms and state-of-the-art graph neural networks. For denoising a single smooth graph signal, the normalized mean square error of the proposed networks is around 40% and 60% lower than that of graph Laplacian denoising and graph wavelets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

We investigate various structural and numerical properties of the graphs in relation to neural network test accuracy. We find that none of the classical numerical graph invariants by itself allows to single out the best networks. Consequently, we introduce a new numerical graph characteristic that selects a set of quasi-1-dimensional graphs, which are a majority among the best performing networks. We also find that networks with primarily short-range connections perform better than networks which allow for many long-range connections. Moreover, many resolution reducing pathways are beneficial.

| **[Graph and graphon neural network stability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12529v4)** | 2021-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are learning architectures that rely on knowledge of the graph structure to generate meaningful representations of large-scale network data. GNN stability is thus important as in real-world scenarios there are typically uncertainties associated with the graph. We analyze GNN stability using kernel objects called graphons. Graphons are both limits of convergent graph sequences and generating models for deterministic and stochastic graphs. Building upon the theory of graphon signal processing, we define graphon neural networks and analyze their stability to graphon perturbations. We then extend this analysis by interpreting the graphon neural network as a generating model for GNNs on deterministic and stochastic graphs instantiated from the original and perturbed graphons. We observe that GNNs are stable to graphon perturbations with a stability bound that decreases asymptotically with the size of the graph. This asymptotic behavior is further demonstrated in an experiment of movie recommendation.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the employment of differentiable loss functions has paved the road to the massive usage of Gradient Descent and related optimization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the development of Graph Neural Drawers (GND), machines that rely on neural computation for constructing efficient and complex maps. GNDs are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) whose learning process can be driven by any provided loss function, such as the ones commonly employed in Graph Drawing. Moreover, we prove that this mechanism can be guided by loss functions computed by means of Feedforward Neural Networks, on the basis of supervision hints that express beauty properties, like the minimization of crossing edges. In this context, we show that GNNs can nicely be enriched by positional features to deal also with unlabelled vertexes. We provide a proof-of-concept by constructing a loss function for the edge-crossing and provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons among different GNN models working under the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transaction of Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS) 2022, Special Issue on Deep Neural Networks for Graphs: Theory, Models, Algorithms and Applications</p></details> |

As the complexity and adoption of blockchain networks continue to grow, traditional analytical methods are proving inadequate in capturing the intricate relationships and dynamic behaviors of decentralized systems. To address these limitations, deep learning models such as GNNs, GCNs, and CNNs offer robust solutions by leveraging the unique graph-based and temporal structures inherent in blockchain architectures. GNNs and GCNs, in particular, excel in modeling the relational data of blockchain nodes and transactions, making them ideal for applications such as fraud detection, transaction verification, and smart contract analysis. Meanwhile, CNNs can be adapted to analyze blockchain data when represented as structured matrices, revealing hidden temporal and spatial patterns in transaction flows. This paper explores how these models enhance the efficiency, security, and scalability of both linear blockchains and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based systems, providing a comprehensive overview of their strengths and future research directions. By integrating advanced neural network techniques, we aim to demonstrate the potential of these models in revolutionizing blockchain analytics, paving the way for more sophisticated decentralized applications and improved network performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Exploiting Edge Features in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.02709v2)** | 2019-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge features contain important information about graphs. However, current state-of-the-art neural network models designed for graph learning, e.g. graph convolutional networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT), adequately utilize edge features, especially multi-dimensional edge features. In this paper, we build a new framework for a family of new graph neural network models that can more sufficiently exploit edge features, including those of undirected or multi-dimensional edges. The proposed framework can consolidate current graph neural network models; e.g. graph convolutional networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT). The proposed framework and new models have the following novelties: First, we propose to use doubly stochastic normalization of graph edge features instead of the commonly used row or symmetric normalization approches used in current graph neural networks. Second, we construct new formulas for the operations in each individual layer so that they can handle multi-dimensional edge features. Third, for the proposed new framework, edge features are adaptive across network layers. As a result, our proposed new framework and new models can exploit a rich source of graph information. We apply our new models to graph node classification on several citation networks, whole graph classification, and regression on several molecular datasets. Compared with the current state-of-the-art methods, i.e. GCNs and GAT, our models obtain better performance, which testify to the importance of exploiting edge features in graph neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01267v2)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks are popular architectures for graph machine learning, based on iterative computation of node representations of an input graph through a series of invariant transformations. A large class of graph neural networks follow a standard message-passing paradigm: at every layer, each node state is updated based on an aggregate of messages from its neighborhood. In this work, we propose a novel framework for training graph neural networks, where every node is viewed as a player that can choose to either 'listen', 'broadcast', 'listen and broadcast', or to 'isolate'. The standard message propagation scheme can then be viewed as a special case of this framework where every node 'listens and broadcasts' to all neighbors. Our approach offers a more flexible and dynamic message-passing paradigm, where each node can determine its own strategy based on their state, effectively exploring the graph topology while learning. We provide a theoretical analysis of the new message-passing scheme which is further supported by an extensive empirical analysis on a synthetic dataset and on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Forty-First International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024).

| **[Sampling and Recovery of Graph Signals based on Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01412v1)** | 2020-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose interpretable graph neural networks for sampling and recovery of graph signals, respectively. To take informative measurements, we propose a new graph neural sampling module, which aims to select those vertices that maximally express their corresponding neighborhoods. Such expressiveness can be quantified by the mutual information between vertices' features and neighborhoods' features, which are estimated via a graph neural network. To reconstruct an original graph signal from the sampled measurements, we propose a graph neural recovery module based on the algorithm-unrolling technique. Compared to previous analytical sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are able to flexibly learn a variety of graph signal models from data by leveraging the learning ability of neural networks; compared to previous neural-network-based sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are designed through exploiting specific graph properties and provide interpretability. We further design a new multiscale graph neural network, which is a trainable multiscale graph filter bank and can handle various graph-related learning tasks. The multiscale network leverages the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules to achieve multiscale representations of a graph. In the experiments, we illustrate the effects of the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules and find that the modules can flexibly adapt to various graph structures and graph signals. In the task of active-sampling-based semi-supervised learning, the graph neural sampling module improves the classification accuracy over 10% in Cora dataset. We further validate the proposed multiscale graph neural network on several standard datasets for both vertex and graph classification. The results show that our method consistently improves the classification accuracies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Diffusion Networks for Semi-supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.09698v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) is a pioneering model for graph-based semi-supervised learning. However, GCN does not perform well on sparsely-labeled graphs. Its two-layer version cannot effectively propagate the label information to the whole graph structure (i.e., the under-smoothing problem) while its deep version over-smoothens and is hard to train (i.e., the over-smoothing problem). To solve these two issues, we propose a new graph neural network called GND-Nets (for Graph Neural Diffusion Networks) that exploits the local and global neighborhood information of a vertex in a single layer. Exploiting the shallow network mitigates the over-smoothing problem while exploiting the local and global neighborhood information mitigates the under-smoothing problem. The utilization of the local and global neighborhood information of a vertex is achieved by a new graph diffusion method called neural diffusions, which integrate neural networks into the conventional linear and nonlinear graph diffusions. The adoption of neural networks makes neural diffusions adaptable to different datasets. Extensive experiments on various sparsely-labeled graphs verify the effectiveness and efficiency of GND-Nets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages |

They are presented here as generalizations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in which individual layers contain banks of graph convolutional filters instead of banks of classical convolutional filters. Otherwise, GNNs operate as CNNs. Filters are composed with pointwise nonlinearities and stacked in layers. It is shown that GNN architectures exhibit equivariance to permutation and stability to graph deformations. These properties help explain the good performance of GNNs that can be observed empirically. It is also shown that if graphs converge to a limit object, a graphon, GNNs converge to a corresponding limit object, a graphon neural network. This convergence justifies the transferability of GNNs across networks with different number of nodes. Concepts are illustrated by the application of GNNs to recommendation systems, decentralized collaborative control, and wireless communication networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the IEEE</p></details> |

Much work is dedicated to empowering GNNs with the adaptive locality ability, which enables measuring the importance of neighboring nodes to the target node by a node-specific mechanism. However, the current node-specific mechanisms are deficient in distinguishing the importance of nodes in the topology structure. We believe that the structural importance of neighboring nodes is closely related to their importance in aggregation. In this paper, we introduce discrete graph curvature (the Ricci curvature) to quantify the strength of structural connection of pairwise nodes. And we propose Curvature Graph Neural Network (CGNN), which effectively improves the adaptive locality ability of GNNs by leveraging the structural property of graph curvature. To improve the adaptability of curvature to various datasets, we explicitly transform curvature into the weights of neighboring nodes by the necessary Negative Curvature Processing Module and Curvature Normalization Module. Then, we conduct numerous experiments on various synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. The experimental results on synthetic datasets show that CGNN effectively exploits the topology structure information, and the performance is improved significantly. CGNN outperforms the baselines on 5 dense node classification benchmark datasets. This study deepens the understanding of how to utilize advanced topology information and assign the importance of neighboring nodes from the perspective of graph curvature and encourages us to bridge the gap between graph theory and neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 Pa...</summary><p>16 Pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to exploit the relational inductive bias exhibited in graphs; they have been shown to outperform other forms of neural networks in scenarios where structure information supplements node features. The most common GNN architecture aggregates information from neighborhoods based on message passing. Its generality has made it broadly applicable. In this paper, we focus on a special, yet widely used, type of graphs -- DAGs -- and inject a stronger inductive bias -- partial ordering -- into the neural network design. We propose the \emph{directed acyclic graph neural network}, DAGNN, an architecture that processes information according to the flow defined by the partial order. DAGNN can be considered a framework that entails earlier works as special cases (e.g., models for trees and models updating node representations recurrently), but we identify several crucial components that prior architectures lack. We perform comprehensive experiments, including ablation studies, on representative DAG datasets (i.e., source code, neural architectures, and probabilistic graphical models) and demonstrate the superiority of DAGNN over simpler DAG architectures as well as general graph architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2021.

Due to the finite nature of the underlying recurrent structure, current GNN methods may struggle to capture long-range dependencies in underlying graphs. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a graph learning framework, called Implicit Graph Neural Networks (IGNN), where predictions are based on the solution of a fixed-point equilibrium equation involving implicitly defined "state" vectors. We use the Perron-Frobenius theory to derive sufficient conditions that ensure well-posedness of the framework. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we derive a tractable projected gradient descent method to train the framework.

This allows training graph neural networks with forward passes only, without backpropagation. Our method is agnostic to the message-passing scheme, and provides a more biologically plausible learning scheme than backpropagation, while also carrying computational advantages. With GFF, graph neural networks are trained greedily layer by layer, using both positive and negative samples. We run experiments on 11 standard graph property prediction tasks, showing how GFF provides an effective alternative to backpropagation for training graph neural networks. This shows in particular that this procedure is remarkably efficient in spite of combining the per-layer training with the locality of the processing in a GNN.</p></details> |  |

The problem has been extensively studied in the literature of both statistical relational learning (e.g. relational Markov networks) and graph neural networks (e.g. graph convolutional networks). Statistical relational learning methods can effectively model the dependency of object labels through conditional random fields for collective classification, whereas graph neural networks learn effective object representations for classification through end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose the Graph Markov Neural Network (GMNN) that combines the advantages of both worlds. A GMNN models the joint distribution of object labels with a conditional random field, which can be effectively trained with the variational EM algorithm. In the E-step, one graph neural network learns effective object representations for approximating the posterior distributions of object labels. In the M-step, another graph neural network is used to model the local label dependency. Experiments on object classification, link classification, and unsupervised node representation learning show that GMNN achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | icml 2019 |

Motivated by their empirical performance, prior works have developed generalization bounds for graph neural networks, which scale with graph structures in terms of the maximum degree. In this paper, we present generalization bounds that instead scale with the largest singular value of the graph neural network's feature diffusion matrix. These bounds are numerically much smaller than prior bounds for real-world graphs. We also construct a lower bound of the generalization gap that matches our upper bound asymptotically. To achieve these results, we analyze a unified model that includes prior works' settings (i.e., convolutional and message-passing networks) and new settings (i.e., graph isomorphism networks). Our key idea is to measure the stability of graph neural networks against noise perturbations using Hessians. Empirically, we find that Hessian-based measurements correlate with the observed generalization gaps of graph neural networks accurately. Optimizing noise stability properties for fine-tuning pretrained graph neural networks also improves test performance on several graph-level classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages.

They typically draw inspiration from diffusion-based methods to introduce a novel propagation scheme, which is analyzed using ordinary differential equations (ODE). However, the implementation of CGNNs requires significant computational power, making them challenging to deploy on battery-powered devices. Inspired by recent spiking neural networks (SNNs), which emulate a biological inference process and provide an energy-efficient neural architecture, we incorporate the SNNs with CGNNs in a unified framework, named Continuous Spiking Graph Neural Networks (COS-GNN). We employ SNNs for graph node representation at each time step, which are further integrated into the ODE process along with time. To enhance information preservation and mitigate information loss in SNNs, we introduce the high-order structure of COS-GNN, which utilizes the second-order ODE for spiking representation and continuous propagation. Moreover, we provide the theoretical proof that COS-GNN effectively mitigates the issues of exploding and vanishing gradients, enabling us to capture long-range dependencies between nodes. Experimental results on graph-based learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed COS-GNN over competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, various strategies have been proposed in the past to improve the expressiveness of GNNs. For example, one straightforward option is to simply increase the parameter size by either expanding the hid-den dimension or increasing the number of GNN layers. However, wider hidden layers can easily lead to overfitting, and incrementally adding more GNN layers can potentially result in over-smoothing.In this paper, we present a model-agnostic methodology, namely Network In Graph Neural Network (NGNN ), that allows arbitrary GNN models to increase their model capacity by making the model deeper. However, instead of adding or widening GNN layers, NGNN deepens a GNN model by inserting non-linear feedforward neural network layer(s) within each GNN layer. An analysis of NGNN as applied to a GraphSage base GNN on ogbn-products data demonstrate that it can keep the model stable against either node feature or graph structure perturbations. Furthermore, wide-ranging evaluation results on both node classification and link prediction tasks show that NGNN works reliably across diverse GNN architectures.For instance, it improves the test accuracy of GraphSage on the ogbn-products by 1.6% and improves the hits@100 score of SEAL on ogbl-ppa by 7.08% and the hits@20 score of GraphSage+Edge-Attr on ogbl-ppi by 6.22%. And at the time of this submission, it achieved two first places on the OGB link prediction leaderboard.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multipath Graph Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.01510v1)** | 2021-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph convolution networks have recently garnered a lot of attention for representation learning on non-Euclidean feature spaces. Recent research has focused on stacking multiple layers like in convolutional neural networks for the increased expressive power of graph convolution networks. However, simply stacking multiple graph convolution layers lead to issues like vanishing gradient, over-fitting and over-smoothing. Such problems are much less when using shallower networks, even though the shallow networks have lower expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel Multipath Graph convolutional neural network that aggregates the output of multiple different shallow networks. We train and test our model on various benchmarks datasets for the task of node property prediction. Results show that the proposed method not only attains increased test accuracy but also requires fewer training epochs to converge.

Successful learning from network data is built upon methods that effectively exploit this graph structure. In this work, we leverage graph signal processing to characterize the representation space of graph neural networks (GNNs). We discuss the role of graph convolutional filters in GNNs and show that any architecture built with such filters has the fundamental properties of permutation equivariance and stability to changes in the topology. These two properties offer insight about the workings of GNNs and help explain their scalability and transferability properties which, coupled with their local and distributed nature, make GNNs powerful tools for learning in physical networks. We also introduce GNN extensions using edge-varying and autoregressive moving average graph filters and discuss their properties. Finally, we study the use of GNNs in recommender systems and learning decentralized controllers for robot swarms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE SPM Special Issue on Graph Signal Processing: Foundations and Emerging Directions</p></details> |
| **[Pre-Training on Dynamic Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12380v2)** | 2022-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-training on the graph neural network model can learn the general features of large-scale networks or networks of the same type by self-supervised methods, which allows the model to work even when node labels are missing. However, the existing pre-training methods do not take network evolution into consideration. This paper proposes a pre-training method on dynamic graph neural networks (PT-DGNN), which uses dynamic attributed graph generation tasks to simultaneously learn the structure, semantics, and evolution features of the graph. The method includes two steps: 1) dynamic sub-graph sampling, and 2) pre-training with dynamic attributed graph generation task. Comparative experiments on three realistic dynamic network datasets show that the proposed method achieves the best results on the link prediction fine-tuning task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks With Lifting-based Adaptive Graph Wavelets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01660v3)** | 2022-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral-based graph neural networks (SGNNs) have been attracting increasing attention in graph representation learning. However, existing SGNNs are limited in implementing graph filters with rigid transforms (e.g., graph Fourier or predefined graph wavelet transforms) and cannot adapt to signals residing on graphs and tasks at hand. In this paper, we propose a novel class of graph neural networks that realizes graph filters with adaptive graph wavelets. Specifically, the adaptive graph wavelets are learned with neural network-parameterized lifting structures, where structure-aware attention-based lifting operations (i.e., prediction and update operations) are developed to jointly consider graph structures and node features. We propose to lift based on diffusion wavelets to alleviate the structural information loss induced by partitioning non-bipartite graphs. By design, the locality and sparsity of the resulting wavelet transform as well as the scalability of the lifting structure are guaranteed. We further derive a soft-thresholding filtering operation by learning sparse graph representations in terms of the learned wavelets, yielding a localized, efficient, and scalable wavelet-based graph filters. To ensure that the learned graph representations are invariant to node permutations, a layer is employed at the input of the networks to reorder the nodes according to their local topology information. We evaluate the proposed networks in both node-level and graph-level representation learning tasks on benchmark citation and bioinformatics graph datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed networks over existing SGNNs in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Deeper Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09296v1)** | 2020-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have shown significant success in the field of graph representation learning. Graph convolutions perform neighborhood aggregation and represent one of the most important graph operations. Nevertheless, one layer of these neighborhood aggregation methods only consider immediate neighbors, and the performance decreases when going deeper to enable larger receptive fields. Several recent studies attribute this performance deterioration to the over-smoothing issue, which states that repeated propagation makes node representations of different classes indistinguishable. In this work, we study this observation systematically and develop new insights towards deeper graph neural networks. First, we provide a systematical analysis on this issue and argue that the key factor compromising the performance significantly is the entanglement of representation transformation and propagation in current graph convolution operations. After decoupling these two operations, deeper graph neural networks can be used to learn graph node representations from larger receptive fields. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the above observation when building very deep models, which can serve as a rigorous and gentle description of the over-smoothing issue. Based on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we propose Deep Adaptive Graph Neural Network (DAGNN) to adaptively incorporate information from large receptive fields. A set of experiments on citation, co-authorship, and co-purchase datasets have confirmed our analysis and insights and demonstrated the superiority of our proposed methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, KDD2020 |

AgentNet is inspired by sublinear algorithms, featuring a computational complexity that is independent of the graph size. The architecture of AgentNet differs fundamentally from the architectures of traditional graph neural networks. In AgentNet, some trained \textit{neural agents} intelligently walk the graph, and then collectively decide on the output. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis of AgentNet: We show that the agents can learn to systematically explore their neighborhood and that AgentNet can distinguish some structures that are even indistinguishable by 2-WL. Moreover, AgentNet is able to separate any two graphs which are sufficiently different in terms of subgraphs. We confirm these theoretical results with synthetic experiments on hard-to-distinguish graphs and real-world graph classification tasks. In both cases, we compare favorably not only to standard GNNs but also to computationally more expensive GNN extensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 6 figures, ICLR 2023</p></details> |
| **[Is Solving Graph Neural Tangent Kernel Equivalent to Training Graph Neural Network?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07452v1)** | 2023-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A rising trend in theoretical deep learning is to understand why deep learning works through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) [jgh18], a kernel method that is equivalent to using gradient descent to train a multi-layer infinitely-wide neural network. NTK is a major step forward in the theoretical deep learning because it allows researchers to use traditional mathematical tools to analyze properties of deep neural networks and to explain various neural network techniques from a theoretical view. A natural extension of NTK on graph learning is \textit{Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK)}, and researchers have already provide GNTK formulation for graph-level regression and show empirically that this kernel method can achieve similar accuracy as GNNs on various bioinformatics datasets [dhs+19]. The remaining question now is whether solving GNTK regression is equivalent to training an infinite-wide multi-layer GNN using gradient descent. In this paper, we provide three new theoretical results. First, we formally prove this equivalence for graph-level regression. Second, we present the first GNTK formulation for node-level regression. Finally, we prove the equivalence for node-level regression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Variate Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20311v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.</p></details> |  |

The neural network is trained to match the distribution of a class of random graphs by way of a moment estimator. The features used for training are graphlets, subgraph counts of small order. The neural network accepts random noise as input and outputs vector representations for nodes in the graph. Random graphs are then realized by applying a kernel to the representations. Graphs produced this way are demonstrated to be able to imitate data from chemistry, medicine, and social networks. The produced graphs are similar enough to the target data to be able to fool discriminator neural networks otherwise capable of separating classes of random graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Isometric Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09554v1)** | 2020-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many tasks that rely on representations of nodes in graphs would benefit if those representations were faithful to distances between nodes in the graph. Geometric techniques to extract such representations have poor scaling over large graph size, and recent advances in Graph Neural Network (GNN) algorithms have limited ability to reflect graph distance information beyond the first degree neighborhood. To enable this highly desired capability, we propose a technique to learn Isometric Graph Neural Networks (IGNN), which requires changing the input representation space and loss function to enable any GNN algorithm to generate representations that reflect distances between nodes. We experiment with the isometric technique on several GNN architectures for modeling multiple prediction tasks on multiple datasets. In addition to an improvement in AUC-ROC as high as $43\%$ in these experiments, we observe a consistent and substantial improvement as high as 400% in Kendall's Tau (KT), a measure that directly reflects distance information, demonstrating that the learned embeddings do account for graph distances.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Initialization of Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02622v1)** | 2023-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have displayed considerable promise in graph representation learning across various applications. The core learning process requires the initialization of model weight matrices within each GNN layer, which is typically accomplished via classic initialization methods such as Xavier initialization. However, these methods were originally motivated to stabilize the variance of hidden embeddings and gradients across layers of Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to avoid vanishing gradients and maintain steady information flow. In contrast, within the GNN context classical initializations disregard the impact of the input graph structure and message passing on variance. In this paper, we analyze the variance of forward and backward propagation across GNN layers and show that the variance instability of GNN initializations comes from the combined effect of the activation function, hidden dimension, graph structure and message passing. To better account for these influence factors, we propose a new initialization method for Variance Instability Reduction within GNN Optimization (Virgo), which naturally tends to equate forward and backward variances across successive layers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on 15 datasets to show that Virgo can lead to superior model performance and more stable variance at initialization on node classification, link prediction and graph classification tasks.

Representing complex networks as structures changing over time allow network models to leverage not only structural but also temporal patterns. However, as dynamic network literature stems from diverse fields and makes use of inconsistent terminology, it is challenging to navigate. Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained a lot of attention in recent years for their ability to perform well on a range of network science tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. Despite the popularity of graph neural networks and the proven benefits of dynamic network models, there has been little focus on graph neural networks for dynamic networks. To address the challenges resulting from the fact that this research crosses diverse fields as well as to survey dynamic graph neural networks, this work is split into two main parts. First, to address the ambiguity of the dynamic network terminology we establish a foundation of dynamic networks with consistent, detailed terminology and notation.

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved promising results in graph analysis tasks. Some state-of-the-art GNN models have been proposed, e.g., Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), etc. Despite these successes, most of the GNNs only have shallow structure. This causes the low expressive power of the GNNs. To fully utilize the power of the deep neural network, some deep GNNs have been proposed recently. However, the design of deep GNNs requires significant architecture engineering. In this work, we propose a method to automate the deep GNNs design. In our proposed method, we add a new type of skip connection to the GNNs search space to encourage feature reuse and alleviate the vanishing gradient problem. We also allow our evolutionary algorithm to increase the layers of GNNs during the evolution to generate deeper networks. We evaluate our method in the graph node classification task. The experiments show that the GNNs generated by our method can obtain state-of-the-art results in Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed and PPI datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICONIP 2020</p></details> |
| **[Torsion Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13541v1)** | 2023-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric deep learning (GDL) models have demonstrated a great potential for the analysis of non-Euclidian data. They are developed to incorporate the geometric and topological information of non-Euclidian data into the end-to-end deep learning architectures. Motivated by the recent success of discrete Ricci curvature in graph neural network (GNNs), we propose TorGNN, an analytic Torsion enhanced Graph Neural Network model. The essential idea is to characterize graph local structures with an analytic torsion based weight formula. Mathematically, analytic torsion is a topological invariant that can distinguish spaces which are homotopy equivalent but not homeomorphic. In our TorGNN, for each edge, a corresponding local simplicial complex is identified, then the analytic torsion (for this local simplicial complex) is calculated, and further used as a weight (for this edge) in message-passing process. Our TorGNN model is validated on link prediction tasks from sixteen different types of networks and node classification tasks from three types of networks. It has been found that our TorGNN can achieve superior performance on both tasks, and outperform various state-of-the-art models. This demonstrates that analytic torsion is a highly efficient topological invariant in the characterization of graph structures and can significantly boost the performance of GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02684v2)** | 2021-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) model nonlinear representations in graph data with applications in distributed agent coordination, control, and planning among others. Current GNN architectures assume ideal scenarios and ignore link fluctuations that occur due to environment, human factors, or external attacks. In these situations, the GNN fails to address its distributed task if the topological randomness is not considered accordingly. To overcome this issue, we put forth the stochastic graph neural network (SGNN) model: a GNN where the distributed graph convolution module accounts for the random network changes. Since stochasticity brings in a new learning paradigm, we conduct a statistical analysis on the SGNN output variance to identify conditions the learned filters should satisfy for achieving robust transference to perturbed scenarios, ultimately revealing the explicit impact of random link losses. We further develop a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based learning process for the SGNN and derive conditions on the learning rate under which this learning process converges to a stationary point. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings and compare the benefits of SGNN robust transference with a conventional GNN that ignores graph perturbations during learning.</p></details> |  |

| **[Early-Exit Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18088v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early-exit mechanisms allow deep neural networks to halt inference as soon as classification confidence is high enough, adaptively trading depth for confidence, and thereby cutting latency and energy on easy inputs while retaining full-depth accuracy for harder ones. Similarly, adding early exit mechanisms to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the go-to models for graph-structured data, allows for dynamic trading depth for confidence on simple graphs while maintaining full-depth accuracy on harder and more complex graphs to capture intricate relationships. Although early exits have proven effective across various deep learning domains, their potential within GNNs in scenarios that require deep architectures while resisting over-smoothing and over-squashing remains largely unexplored. We unlock that potential by first introducing Symmetric-Anti-Symmetric Graph Neural Networks (SAS-GNN), whose symmetry-based inductive biases mitigate these issues and yield stable intermediate representations that can be useful to allow early exiting in GNNs. Building on this backbone, we present Early-Exit Graph Neural Networks (EEGNNs), which append confidence-aware exit heads that allow on-the-fly termination of propagation based on each node or the entire graph. Experiments show that EEGNNs preserve robust performance as depth grows and deliver competitive accuracy on heterophilic and long-range benchmarks, matching attention-based and asynchronous message-passing models while substantially reducing computation and latency. We plan to release the code to reproduce our experiments.</p></details> | 37 pages, 14 figures |

In real-world scenarios, graphs may have nodes that exhibit both homophily and heterophily. Failing to generalize to this setting makes many GNNs underperform in graph classification. In this paper, we address this limitation by identifying three effective designs and develop a novel GNN architecture called IHGNN (short for Incorporating Heterophily into Graph Neural Networks). These designs include the combination of integration and separation of the ego- and neighbor-embeddings of nodes, adaptive aggregation of node embeddings from different layers, and differentiation between different node embeddings for constructing the graph-level readout function. We empirically validate IHGNN on various graph datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art GNNs for graph classification.</p></details> | 8 pages |

| **[KerGNNs: Interpretable Graph Neural Networks with Graph Kernels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00491v2)** | 2022-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph kernels are historically the most widely-used technique for graph classification tasks. However, these methods suffer from limited performance because of the hand-crafted combinatorial features of graphs. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art method in downstream graph-related tasks due to their superior performance. Most GNNs are based on Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) frameworks. However, recent studies show that MPNNs can not exceed the power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm in graph isomorphism test. To address the limitations of existing graph kernel and GNN methods, in this paper, we propose a novel GNN framework, termed \textit{Kernel Graph Neural Networks} (KerGNNs), which integrates graph kernels into the message passing process of GNNs. Inspired by convolution filters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), KerGNNs adopt trainable hidden graphs as graph filters which are combined with subgraphs to update node embeddings using graph kernels. In addition, we show that MPNNs can be viewed as special cases of KerGNNs. We apply KerGNNs to multiple graph-related tasks and use cross-validation to make fair comparisons with benchmarks. We show that our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the potential to increase the representation ability of GNNs. We also show that the trained graph filters in KerGNNs can reveal the local graph structures of the dataset, which significantly improves the model interpretability compared with conventional GNN models.</p></details> |  |
| **[How hard is to distinguish graphs with graph neural networks?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06649v2)** | 2020-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A hallmark of graph neural networks is their ability to distinguish the isomorphism class of their inputs. This study derives hardness results for the classification variant of graph isomorphism in the message-passing model (MPNN). MPNN encompasses the majority of graph neural networks used today and is universal when nodes are given unique features. The analysis relies on the introduced measure of communication capacity. Capacity measures how much information the nodes of a network can exchange during the forward pass and depends on the depth, message-size, global state, and width of the architecture. It is shown that the capacity of MPNN needs to grow linearly with the number of nodes so that a network can distinguish trees and quadratically for general connected graphs. The derived bounds concern both worst- and average-case behavior and apply to networks with/without unique features and adaptive architecture -- they are also up to two orders of magnitude tighter than those given by simpler arguments. An empirical study involving 12 graph classification tasks and 420 networks reveals strong alignment between actual performance and theoretical predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network Tomography with Path-Centric Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16430v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network tomography is a crucial problem in network monitoring, where the observable path performance metric values are used to infer the unobserved ones, making it essential for tasks such as route selection, fault diagnosis, and traffic control. However, most existing methods either assume complete knowledge of network topology and metric formulas-an unrealistic expectation in many real-world scenarios with limited observability-or rely entirely on black-box end-to-end models. To tackle this, in this paper, we argue that a good network tomography requires synergizing the knowledge from both data and appropriate inductive bias from (partial) prior knowledge. To see this, we propose Deep Network Tomography (DeepNT), a novel framework that leverages a path-centric graph neural network to predict path performance metrics without relying on predefined hand-crafted metrics, assumptions, or the real network topology. The path-centric graph neural network learns the path embedding by inferring and aggregating the embeddings of the sequence of nodes that compose this path. Training path-centric graph neural networks requires learning the neural netowrk parameters and network topology under discrete constraints induced by the observed path performance metrics, which motivates us to design a learning objective that imposes connectivity and sparsity constraints on topology and path performance triangle inequality on path performance. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of DeepNT in predicting performance metrics and inferring graph topology compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage neural networks to model complex graph structures. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network (KAN) has emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), offering improved accuracy and interpretability with fewer parameters. In this paper, we propose the integration of KANs into Signed Graph Convolutional Networks (SGCNs), leading to the development of KAN-enhanced SGCNs (KASGCN). We evaluate KASGCN on tasks such as signed community detection and link sign prediction to improve embedding quality in signed networks. Our experimental results indicate that KASGCN exhibits competitive or comparable performance to standard SGCNs across the tasks evaluated, with performance variability depending on the specific characteristics of the signed graph and the choice of parameter settings. These findings suggest that KASGCNs hold promise for enhancing signed graph analysis with context-dependent effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

The result is a flexible and broadly useful class of neural network models that has favorable inductive biases relative to purely sequence-based models (e.g., LSTMs) when the problem is graph-structured. We demonstrate the capabilities on some simple AI (bAbI) and graph algorithm learning tasks. We then show it achieves state-of-the-art performance on a problem from program verification, in which subgraphs need to be matched to abstract data structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper in ICLR 2016.

| **[Generalization Error of Graph Neural Networks in the Mean-field Regime](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07025v3)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work provides a theoretical framework for assessing the generalization error of graph neural networks in the over-parameterized regime, where the number of parameters surpasses the quantity of data points. We explore two widely utilized types of graph neural networks: graph convolutional neural networks and message passing graph neural networks. Prior to this study, existing bounds on the generalization error in the over-parametrized regime were uninformative, limiting our understanding of over-parameterized network performance. Our novel approach involves deriving upper bounds within the mean-field regime for evaluating the generalization error of these graph neural networks. We establish upper bounds with a convergence rate of $O(1/n)$, where $n$ is the number of graph samples. These upper bounds offer a theoretical assurance of the networks' performance on unseen data in the challenging over-parameterized regime and overall contribute to our understanding of their performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Graph neural networks and non-commuting operators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04265v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide state-of-the-art results in a wide variety of tasks which typically involve predicting features at the vertices of a graph. They are built from layers of graph convolutions which serve as a powerful inductive bias for describing the flow of information among the vertices. Often, more than one data modality is available. This work considers a setting in which several graphs have the same vertex set and a common vertex-level learning task. This generalizes standard GNN models to GNNs with several graph operators that do not commute. We may call this model graph-tuple neural networks (GtNN). In this work, we develop the mathematical theory to address the stability and transferability of GtNNs using properties of non-commuting non-expansive operators. We develop a limit theory of graphon-tuple neural networks and use it to prove a universal transferability theorem that guarantees that all graph-tuple neural networks are transferable on convergent graph-tuple sequences. In particular, there is no non-transferable energy under the convergence we consider here. Our theoretical results extend well-known transferability theorems for GNNs to the case of several simultaneous graphs (GtNNs) and provide a strict improvement on what is currently known even in the GNN case. We illustrate our theoretical results with simple experiments on synthetic and real-world data. To this end, we derive a training procedure that provably enforces the stability of the resulting model.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

In addition to real-valued GNNs, quaternion GNNs also perform well on tasks on graph-structured data. With the aim of reducing the energy footprint, we reduce the model size while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of the original-sized GNNs. This paper introduces Quaternion Message Passing Neural Networks (QMPNNs), a framework that leverages quaternion space to compute node representations. Our approach offers a generalizable method for incorporating quaternion representations into GNN architectures at one-fourth of the original parameter count. Furthermore, we present a novel perspective on Graph Lottery Tickets, redefining their applicability within the context of GNNs and QMPNNs. We specifically aim to find the initialization lottery from the subnetwork of the GNNs that can achieve comparable performance to the original GNN upon training. Thereby reducing the trainable model parameters even further. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed QMPNN framework and LTH for both GNNs and QMPNNs, we evaluate their performance on real-world datasets across three fundamental graph-based tasks: node classification, link prediction, and graph classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, accepted at PAKDD 2025</p></details> |

More specifically, we introduce a graph neural network called Colored Local Iterative Procedure (CLIP) that uses colors to disambiguate identical node attributes, and show that this representation is a universal approximator of continuous functions on graphs with node attributes. Our method relies on separability , a key topological characteristic that allows to extend well-chosen neural networks into universal representations. Finally, we show experimentally that CLIP is capable of capturing structural characteristics that traditional MPNNs fail to distinguish,while being state-of-the-art on benchmark graph classification datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 2 figures |

Current filters in graph CNNs are built for fixed and shared graph structure. However, for most real data, the graph structures varies in both size and connectivity. The paper proposes a generalized and flexible graph CNN taking data of arbitrary graph structure as input. In that way a task-driven adaptive graph is learned for each graph data while training. To efficiently learn the graph, a distance metric learning is proposed. Extensive experiments on nine graph-structured datasets have demonstrated the superior performance improvement on both convergence speed and predictive accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18), 8 pages</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Filters in Graph Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10377v4)** | 2023-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the last few years, we have witnessed the availability of an increasing data generated from non-Euclidean domains, which are usually represented as graphs with complex relationships, and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have gained a high interest because of their potential in processing graph-structured data. In particular, there is a strong interest in exploring the possibilities in performing convolution on graphs using an extension of the GNN architecture, generally referred to as Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvGNN). Convolution on graphs has been achieved mainly in two forms: spectral and spatial convolutions. Due to the higher flexibility in exploring and exploiting the graph structure of data, there is recently an increasing interest in investigating the possibilities that the spatial approach can offer. The idea of finding a way to adapt the network behaviour to the inputs they process to maximize the total performances has aroused much interest in the neural networks literature over the years. This paper presents a novel method to adapt the behaviour of a ConvGNN to the input proposing a method to perform spatial convolution on graphs using input-specific filters, which are dynamically generated from nodes feature vectors. The experimental assessment confirms the capabilities of the proposed approach, which achieves satisfying results using a low number of filters.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been published in its final version on \textit{Pattern Recognition} journal with DOI https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2023.109867 in Open Access mode.

| **[Transition Propagation Graph Neural Networks for Temporal Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.07501v1)** | 2023-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers of temporal networks (e.g., social networks and transaction networks) have been interested in mining dynamic patterns of nodes from their diverse interactions. Inspired by recently powerful graph mining methods like skip-gram models and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing approaches focus on generating temporal node embeddings sequentially with nodes' sequential interactions. However, the sequential modeling of previous approaches cannot handle the transition structure between nodes' neighbors with limited memorization capacity. Detailedly, an effective method for the transition structures is required to both model nodes' personalized patterns adaptively and capture node dynamics accordingly. In this paper, we propose a method, namely Transition Propagation Graph Neural Networks (TIP-GNN), to tackle the challenges of encoding nodes' transition structures. The proposed TIP-GNN focuses on the bilevel graph structure in temporal networks: besides the explicit interaction graph, a node's sequential interactions can also be constructed as a transition graph. Based on the bilevel graph, TIP-GNN further encodes transition structures by multi-step transition propagation and distills information from neighborhoods by a bilevel graph convolution. Experimental results over various temporal networks reveal the efficiency of our TIP-GNN, with at most 7.2\% improvements of accuracy on temporal link prediction. Extensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness and limitations of the transition propagation module.

| **[Supervised Attention Using Homophily in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05217v2)** | 2023-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have become the standard approach for dealing with learning problems on graphs. Among the different variants of graph neural networks, graph attention networks (GATs) have been applied with great success to different tasks. In the GAT model, each node assigns an importance score to its neighbors using an attention mechanism. However, similar to other graph neural networks, GATs aggregate messages from nodes that belong to different classes, and therefore produce node representations that are not well separated with respect to the different classes, which might hurt their performance. In this work, to alleviate this problem, we propose a new technique that can be incorporated into any graph attention model to encourage higher attention scores between nodes that share the same class label. We evaluate the proposed method on several node classification datasets demonstrating increased performance over standard baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICANN 2023</p></details> |

We present a graph neural network class named recurrent graph neural network (RGNN), that address the shortcomings of prior methods. By using recurrent units to capture the long-term dependency across layers, our methods can successfully identify important information during recursive neighborhood expansion. In our experiments, we show that our model class achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks: the Pubmed, Reddit, and PPI network datasets. Our in-depth analyses also demonstrate that incorporating recurrent units is a simple yet effective method to prevent noisy information in graphs, which enables a deeper graph neural network.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Stability of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks under Edge Rewiring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13747v2)** | 2021-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks are experiencing a surge of popularity within the machine learning community due to their ability to adapt to non-Euclidean domains and instil inductive biases. Despite this, their stability, i.e., their robustness to small perturbations in the input, is not yet well understood. Although there exists some results showing the stability of graph neural networks, most take the form of an upper bound on the magnitude of change due to a perturbation in the graph topology. However, the change in the graph topology captured in existing bounds tend not to be expressed in terms of structural properties, limiting our understanding of the model robustness properties. In this work, we develop an interpretable upper bound elucidating that graph neural networks are stable to rewiring between high degree nodes. This bound and further research in bounds of similar type provide further understanding of the stability properties of graph neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the 46th International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2021)</p></details> |
| **[Improving Graph Neural Networks with Simple Architecture Design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.07634v1)** | 2021-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks have emerged as a useful tool to learn on the data by applying additional constraints based on the graph structure. These graphs are often created with assumed intrinsic relations between the entities. In recent years, there have been tremendous improvements in the architecture design, pushing the performance up in various prediction tasks. In general, these neural architectures combine layer depth and node feature aggregation steps. This makes it challenging to analyze the importance of features at various hops and the expressiveness of the neural network layers. As different graph datasets show varying levels of homophily and heterophily in features and class label distribution, it becomes essential to understand which features are important for the prediction tasks without any prior information. In this work, we decouple the node feature aggregation step and depth of graph neural network and introduce several key design strategies for graph neural networks. More specifically, we propose to use softmax as a regularizer and "Soft-Selector" of features aggregated from neighbors at different hop distances; and "Hop-Normalization" over GNN layers. Combining these techniques, we present a simple and shallow model, Feature Selection Graph Neural Network (FSGNN), and show empirically that the proposed model outperforms other state of the art GNN models and achieves up to 64% improvements in accuracy on node classification tasks. Moreover, analyzing the learned soft-selection parameters of the model provides a simple way to study the importance of features in the prediction tasks. Finally, we demonstrate with experiments that the model is scalable for large graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges.</p></details> |  |

The approach exploits the idea of representing each input graph as a fixed point of a dynamical system (implemented through a recurrent neural network), and leverages a deep architectural organization of the recurrent units. Efficiency is gained by many aspects, including the use of small and very sparse networks, where the weights of the recurrent units are left untrained under the stability condition introduced in this work. This can be viewed as a way to study the intrinsic power of the architecture of a deep GNN, and also to provide insights for the set-up of more complex fully-trained models. Through experimental results, we show that even without training of the recurrent connections, the architecture of small deep GNN is surprisingly able to achieve or improve the state-of-the-art performance on a significant set of tasks in the field of graphs classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print of 'Fast and Deep Graph Neural Networks', accepted for AAAI 2020.

| **[Graph Neural Networks with a Distribution of Parametrized Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16401v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, graph neural networks have been trained using a single observed graph. However, the observed graph represents only one possible realization. In many applications, the graph may encounter uncertainties, such as having erroneous or missing edges, as well as edge weights that provide little informative value. To address these challenges and capture additional information previously absent in the observed graph, we introduce latent variables to parameterize and generate multiple graphs. We obtain the maximum likelihood estimate of the network parameters in an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework based on the multiple graphs. Specifically, we iteratively determine the distribution of the graphs using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, incorporating the principles of PAC-Bayesian theory. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements in performance against baseline models on node classification for heterogeneous graphs and graph regression on chemistry datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Graph Sufficiency Perspective for Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10215v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper analyzes neural networks through graph variables and statistical sufficiency. We interpret neural network layers as graph-based transformations, where neurons act as pairwise functions between inputs and learned anchor points. Within this formulation, we establish conditions under which layer outputs are sufficient for the layer inputs, that is, each layer preserves the conditional distribution of the target variable given the input variable. We explore two theoretical paths under this graph-based view. The first path assumes dense anchor points and shows that asymptotic sufficiency holds in the infinite-width limit and is preserved throughout training. The second path, more aligned with practical architectures, proves exact or approximate sufficiency in finite-width networks by assuming region-separated input distributions and constructing appropriate anchor points. This path can ensure the sufficiency property for an infinite number of layers, and provide error bounds on the optimal loss for both regression and classification tasks using standard neural networks. Our framework covers fully connected layers, general pairwise functions, ReLU and sigmoid activations, and convolutional neural networks. Overall, this work bridges statistical sufficiency, graph-theoretic representations, and deep learning, providing a new statistical understanding of neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages main + 10 pages appendix, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Saliency-Aware Regularized Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00755v1)** | 2024-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The crux of graph classification lies in the effective representation learning for the entire graph. Typical graph neural networks focus on modeling the local dependencies when aggregating features of neighboring nodes, and obtain the representation for the entire graph by aggregating node features. Such methods have two potential limitations: 1) the global node saliency w.r.t. graph classification is not explicitly modeled, which is crucial since different nodes may have different semantic relevance to graph classification; 2) the graph representation directly aggregated from node features may have limited effectiveness to reflect graph-level information. In this work, we propose the Saliency-Aware Regularized Graph Neural Network (SAR-GNN) for graph classification, which consists of two core modules: 1) a traditional graph neural network serving as the backbone for learning node features and 2) the Graph Neural Memory designed to distill a compact graph representation from node features of the backbone. We first estimate the global node saliency by measuring the semantic similarity between the compact graph representation and node features. Then the learned saliency distribution is leveraged to regularize the neighborhood aggregation of the backbone, which facilitates the message passing of features for salient nodes and suppresses the less relevant nodes. Thus, our model can learn more effective graph representation. We demonstrate the merits of SAR-GNN by extensive experiments on seven datasets across various types of graph data. Code will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Artificial Intelligence Journal with minor revision</p></details> |
