| **[Unleashing the Potential of Sparse Attention on Long-term Behaviors for CTR Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17836v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the success of large language models (LLMs) has driven the exploration of scaling laws in recommender systems. However, models that demonstrate scaling laws are actually challenging to deploy in industrial settings for modeling long sequences of user behaviors, due to the high computational complexity of the standard self-attention mechanism. Despite various sparse self-attention mechanisms proposed in other fields, they are not fully suited for recommendation scenarios. This is because user behaviors exhibit personalization and temporal characteristics: different users have distinct behavior patterns, and these patterns change over time, with data from these users differing significantly from data in other fields in terms of distribution. To address these challenges, we propose SparseCTR, an efficient and effective model specifically designed for long-term behaviors of users. To be precise, we first segment behavior sequences into chunks in a personalized manner to avoid separating continuous behaviors and enable parallel processing of sequences. Based on these chunks, we propose a three-branch sparse self-attention mechanism to jointly identify users' global interests, interest transitions, and short-term interests. Furthermore, we design a composite relative temporal encoding via learnable, head-specific bias coefficients, better capturing sequential and periodic relationships among user behaviors. Extensive experimental results show that SparseCTR not only improves efficiency but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, it exhibits an obvious scaling law phenomenon, maintaining performance improvements across three orders of magnitude in FLOPs. In online A/B testing, SparseCTR increased CTR by 1.72\% and CPM by 1.41\%. Our source code is available at https://github.com/laiweijiang/SparseCTR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does LLM Focus on the Right Words? Mitigating Context Bias in LLM-based Recommenders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10978v3)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), owing to their extensive open-domain knowledge and semantic reasoning capabilities, have been increasingly integrated into recommender systems (RS). However, a substantial gap remains between the pre-training objectives of LLMs and the specific requirements of recommendation tasks. To address this gap, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly performed on specially curated recommendation datasets to further enhance their predictive ability. Despite its success, SFT exhibits a critical limitation: it induces Context Bias, whereby the model over-relies on auxiliary tokens, such as task descriptions and prefix-generated tokens, while underutilizing core user interaction tokens that encode user-specific preferences. This bias not only undermines recommendation accuracy but also raises unfairness concerns. To address this issue, we propose Group Distributionally Robust Optimization-based Tuning (GDRT), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that enforces consistent model performance across token groups with varying degrees of relevance to auxiliary tokens. By adaptively upweighting underperforming groups, typically those weakly correlated with auxiliary tokens, GDRT shifts the model's attention from superficial auxiliary cues to informative user interaction tokens, thereby mitigating context bias. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that GDRT effectively mitigates context bias, yielding substantial improvements in recommendation accuracy (with an average NDCG@10 gain of 24.29%) and significantly enhancing recommendation fairness. The code is available at https://github.com/WANGBohaO-jpg/GDRT.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW2026 |
| **[Token-Weighted Multi-Target Learning for Generative Recommenders with Curriculum Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17787v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommender systems have recently attracted attention by formulating next-item prediction as an autoregressive sequence generation task. However, most existing methods optimize standard next-token likelihood and implicitly treat all tokens as equally informative, which is misaligned with semantic-ID-based generation. Accordingly, we propose two complementary information-gain-based token-weighting strategies tailored to generative recommendation with semantic IDs. Front-Greater Weighting captures conditional semantic information gain by prioritizing early tokens that most effectively reduce candidate-item uncertainty given their prefixes and encode coarse semantics. Frequency Weighting models marginal information gain under long-tailed item and token distributions, upweighting rare tokens to counteract popularity bias. Beyond individual strategies, we introduce a multi-target learning framework with curriculum learning that jointly optimizes the two token-weighted objectives alongside standard likelihood, enabling stable optimization and adaptive emphasis across training stages. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines and existing token-weighting approaches, with improved robustness, strong generalization across different semantic-ID constructions, and substantial gains on both head and tail items. Code is available at https://github.com/CHIUWEINING/Token-Weighted-Multi-Target-Learning-for-Generative-Recommenders-with-Curriculum-Learning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MLLMRec: A Preference Reasoning Paradigm with Graph Refinement for Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15304v2)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation combines the user historical behaviors with the modal features of items to capture the tangible user preferences, presenting superior performance compared to the conventional ID-based recommender systems. However, existing methods still encounter two key problems in the representation learning of users and items, respectively: (1) the initialization of multimodal user representations is either agnostic to historical behaviors or contaminated by irrelevant modal noise, and (2) the widely used KNN-based item-item graph contains noisy edges with low similarities and lacks audience co-occurrence relationships. To address such issues, we propose MLLMRec, a novel preference reasoning paradigm with graph refinement for multimodal recommendation. Specifically, on the one hand, the item images are first converted into high-quality semantic descriptions using a multimodal large language model (MLLM), thereby bridging the semantic gap between visual and textual modalities. Then, we construct a behavioral description list for each user and feed it into the MLLM to reason about the purified user preference profiles that contain the latent interaction intents. On the other hand, we develop the threshold-controlled denoising and topology-aware enhancement strategies to refine the suboptimal item-item graph, thereby improving the accuracy of item representation learning. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that MLLMRec achieves the state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of 21.48% over the optimal baselines. The source code is provided at https://github.com/Yuzhuo-Dang/MLLMRec.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fair Large Language Model-based Recommender Systems without Costly Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17492v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Recommender Systems (RS) through advanced generative user modeling. However, LLM-based RS (LLM-RS) often inadvertently perpetuates bias present in the training data, leading to severe fairness issues. Addressing these fairness problems in LLM-RS faces two significant challenges. 1) Existing debiasing methods, designed for specific bias types, lack the generality to handle diverse or emerging biases in real-world applications. 2) Debiasing methods relying on retraining are computationally infeasible given the massive parameter scale of LLMs. To overcome these challenges, we propose FUDLR (Fast Unified Debiasing for LLM-RS). The core idea is to reformulate the debiasing problem as an efficient machine unlearning task with two stages. First, FUDLR identifies bias-inducing samples to unlearn through a novel bias-agnostic mask, optimized to balance fairness improvement with accuracy preservation. Its bias-agnostic design allows adaptability to various or co-existing biases simply by incorporating different fairness metrics. Second, FUDLR performs efficient debiasing by estimating and removing the influence of identified samples on model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FUDLR effectively and efficiently improves fairness while preserving recommendation accuracy, offering a practical path toward socially responsible LLM-RS. The code and data are available at https://github.com/JinLi-i/FUDLR.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW 2026 |
| **[Evaluating Conversational Recommender Systems via Large Language Models: A User-Centric Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09493v4)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) integrate both recommendation and dialogue tasks, making their evaluation uniquely challenging. Existing approaches primarily assess CRS performance by separately evaluating item recommendation and dialogue management using rule-based metrics. However, these methods fail to capture the real human experience, and they cannot draw direct conclusions about the system's overall performance. As conversational recommender systems become increasingly vital in e-commerce, social media, and customer support, the ability to evaluate both recommendation accuracy and dialogue management quality using a single metric, thereby authentically reflecting user experience, has become the principal challenge impeding progress in this field. In this work, we propose a user-centric evaluation framework based on large language models (LLMs) for CRSs, namely Conversational Recommendation Evaluator (CoRE). CoRE consists of two main components: (1) LLM-As-Evaluator. Firstly, we comprehensively summarize 12 key factors influencing user experience in CRSs and directly leverage LLM as an evaluator to assign a score to each factor. (2) Multi-Agent Debater. Secondly, we design a multi-agent debate framework with four distinct roles (common user, domain expert, linguist, and HCI expert) to discuss and synthesize the 12 evaluation factors into a unified overall performance score. Furthermore, we apply the proposed framework to evaluate four CRSs on two benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that CoRE aligns well with human evaluation in most of the 12 factors and the overall assessment. Especially, CoRE's overall evaluation scores demonstrate significantly better alignment with human feedback compared to existing rule-based metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation on Entity Matching in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17218v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entity matching is a crucial component in various recommender systems, including conversational recommender systems (CRS) and knowledge-based recommender systems. However, the lack of rigorous evaluation frameworks for cross-dataset entity matching impedes progress in areas such as LLM-driven conversational recommendations and knowledge-grounded dataset construction. In this paper, we introduce Reddit-Amazon-EM, a novel dataset comprising naturally occurring items from Reddit and the Amazon '23 dataset. Through careful manual annotation, we identify corresponding movies across Reddit-Movies and Amazon'23, two existing recommender system datasets with inherently overlapping catalogs. Leveraging Reddit-Amazon-EM, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art entity matching methods, including rule-based, graph-based, lexical-based, embedding-based, and LLM-based approaches. For reproducible research, we release our manually annotated entity matching gold set and provide the mapping between the two datasets using the best-performing method from our experiments. This serves as a valuable resource for advancing future work on entity matching in recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Reasoning for Cold-Start Item Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18261v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for improving recommendation systems through their inherent reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base. Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on Proceedings of the ACM on Web Conference 2026 (WWW 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Explaining Group Recommendations via Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16882v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group recommender systems help users make collective choices but often lack transparency, leaving group members uncertain about why items are suggested. Existing explanation methods focus on individuals, offering limited support for groups where multiple preferences interact. In this paper, we propose a framework for group counterfactual explanations, which reveal how removing specific past interactions would change a group recommendation. We formalize this concept, introduce utility and fairness measures tailored to groups, and design heuristic algorithms, such as Pareto-based filtering and grow-and-prune strategies, for efficient explanation discovery. Experiments on MovieLens and Amazon datasets show clear trade-offs: low-cost methods produce larger, less fair explanations, while other approaches yield concise and balanced results at higher cost. Furthermore, the Pareto-filtering heuristic demonstrates significant efficiency improvements in sparse settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Atom to Community: Structured and Evolving Agent Memory for User Behavior Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16872v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User behavior modeling lies at the heart of personalized applications like recommender systems. With LLM-based agents, user preference representation has evolved from latent embeddings to semantic memory. While existing memory mechanisms show promise in textual dialogues, modeling non-textual behaviors remains challenging, as preferences must be inferred from implicit signals like clicks without ground truth supervision. Current approaches rely on a single unstructured summary, updated through simple overwriting. However, this is suboptimal: users exhibit multi-faceted interests that get conflated, preferences evolve yet naive overwriting causes forgetting, and sparse individual interactions necessitate collaborative signals. We present STEAM (\textit{\textbf{ST}ructured and \textbf{E}volving \textbf{A}gent \textbf{M}emory}), a novel framework that reimagines how agent memory is organized and updated. STEAM decomposes preferences into atomic memory units, each capturing a distinct interest dimension with explicit links to observed behaviors. To exploit collaborative patterns, STEAM organizes similar memories across users into communities and generates prototype memories for signal propagation. The framework further incorporates adaptive evolution mechanisms, including consolidation for refining memories and formation for capturing emerging interests. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that STEAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation accuracy, simulation fidelity, and diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[PI2I: A Personalized Item-Based Collaborative Filtering Retrieval Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16815v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently selecting relevant content from vast candidate pools is a critical challenge in modern recommender systems. Traditional methods, such as item-to-item collaborative filtering (CF) and two-tower models, often fall short in capturing the complex user-item interactions due to uniform truncation strategies and overdue user-item crossing. To address these limitations, we propose Personalized Item-to-Item (PI2I), a novel two-stage retrieval framework that enhances the personalization capabilities of CF. In the first Indexer Building Stage (IBS), we optimize the retrieval pool by relaxing truncation thresholds to maximize Hit Rate, thereby temporarily retaining more items users might be interested in. In the second Personalized Retrieval Stage (PRS), we introduce an interactive scoring model to overcome the limitations of inner product calculations, allowing for richer modeling of intricate user-item interactions. Additionally, we construct negative samples based on the trigger-target (item-to-item) relationship, ensuring consistency between offline training and online inference. Offline experiments on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that PI2I outperforms traditional CF methods and rivals Two-Tower models. Deployed in the "Guess You Like" section on Taobao, PI2I achieved a 1.05% increase in online transaction rates. In addition, we have released a large-scale recommendation dataset collected from Taobao, containing 130 million real-world user interactions used in the experiments of this paper. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/PI2I/PI2I, which could serve as a valuable benchmark for the research community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on WWW'26: In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2026</p></details> |
| **[Faster and Memory-Efficient Training of Sequential Recommendation Models for Large Catalogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09682v5)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendations (SR) with transformer-based architectures are widely adopted in real-world applications, where SR models require frequent retraining to adapt to ever-changing user preferences. However, training transformer-based SR models often encounters a high computational cost associated with scoring extensive item catalogs, often exceeding thousands of items. This occurs mainly due to the use of cross-entropy loss, where peak memory scales proportionally to catalog size, batch size, and sequence length. Recognizing this, practitioners in the field of recommendation systems typically address memory consumption by integrating the cross-entropy (CE) loss with negative sampling, thereby reducing the explicit memory demands of the final layer. However, a small number of negative samples would degrade model performance, and as we demonstrate in our work, increasing the number of negative samples and the batch size further improves the model's performance, but rapidly starts to exceed industrial GPUs' size (~40Gb). In this work, we introduce the CCE- method, which offers a GPU-efficient implementation of the CE loss with negative sampling. Our method accelerates training by up to two times while reducing memory consumption by more than 10 times. Leveraging the memory savings afforded by using CCE- for model training, it becomes feasible to enhance its accuracy on datasets with a large item catalog compared to those trained with original PyTorch-implemented loss functions. Finally, we perform an analysis of key memory-related hyperparameters and highlight the necessity of a delicate balance among these factors. We demonstrate that scaling both the number of negative samples and batch size leads to better results rather than maximizing only one of them. To facilitate further adoption of CCE-, we release a Triton kernel that efficiently implements the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-powered Real-time Patent Citation Recommendation for Financial Technologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16775v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid financial innovation has been accompanied by a sharp increase in patenting activity, making timely and comprehensive prior-art discovery more difficult. This problem is especially evident in financial technologies, where innovations develop quickly, patent collections grow continuously, and citation recommendation systems must be updated as new applications arrive. Existing patent retrieval and citation recommendation methods typically rely on static indexes or periodic retraining, which limits their ability to operate effectively in such dynamic settings. In this study, we propose a real-time patent citation recommendation framework designed for large and fast-changing financial patent corpora. Using a dataset of 428,843 financial patents granted by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) between 2000 and 2024, we build a three-stage recommendation pipeline. The pipeline uses large language model (LLM) embeddings to represent the semantic content of patent abstracts, applies efficient approximate nearest-neighbor search to construct a manageable candidate set, and ranks candidates by semantic similarity to produce top-k citation recommendations. In addition to improving recommendation accuracy, the proposed framework directly addresses the dynamic nature of patent systems. By using an incremental indexing strategy based on hierarchical navigable small-world (HNSW) graphs, newly issued patents can be added without rebuilding the entire index. A rolling day-by-day update experiment shows that incremental updating improves recall while substantially reducing computational cost compared with rebuild-based indexing. The proposed method also consistently outperforms traditional text-based baselines and alternative nearest-neighbor retrieval approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[SciNUP: Natural Language User Interest Profiles for Scientific Literature Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21352v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of natural language (NL) user profiles in recommender systems offers greater transparency and user control compared to traditional representations. However, there is scarcity of large-scale, publicly available test collections for evaluating NL profile-based recommendation. To address this gap, we introduce SciNUP, a novel synthetic dataset for scholarly recommendation that leverages authors' publication histories to generate NL profiles and corresponding ground truth items. We use this dataset to conduct a comparison of baseline methods, ranging from sparse and dense retrieval approaches to state-of-the-art LLM-based rerankers. Our results show that while baseline methods achieve comparable performance, they often retrieve different items, indicating complementary behaviors. At the same time, considerable headroom for improvement remains, highlighting the need for effective NL-based recommendation approaches. The SciNUP dataset thus serves as a valuable resource for fostering future research and development in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR '26), 2026</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking Scaling Law in Industrial Recommendation Systems with a Three-step Paradigm based Large User Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08309v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant milestones, largely attributed to their scalability, often referred to as the "scaling law". Inspired by these achievements, there has been a growing interest in adapting LLMs for Recommendation Systems (RecSys) by reformulating RecSys tasks into generative problems. However, these End-to-End Generative Recommendation (E2E-GR) methods tend to prioritize idealized goals, often at the expense of the practical advantages offered by traditional Deep Learning based Recommendation Models (DLRMs) in terms of in features, architecture, and practices. This disparity between idealized goals and practical needs introduces several challenges and limitations, locking the scaling law in industrial RecSys. In this paper, we introduce a large user model (LUM) that addresses these limitations through a three-step paradigm, designed to meet the stringent requirements of industrial settings while unlocking the potential for scalable recommendations. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that LUM outperforms both state-of-the-art DLRMs and E2E-GR approaches. Notably, LUM exhibits excellent scalability, with performance improvements observed as the model scales up to 7 billion parameters. Additionally, we have successfully deployed LUM in an industrial application, where it achieved significant gains in an A/B test, further validating its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>WSDM ...</summary><p>WSDM 2026, 10 pages; The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[REG4Rec: Reasoning-Enhanced Generative Model for Large-Scale Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15308v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation aims to predict a user's next action in large-scale recommender systems. While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient information interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially address this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture user intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into generative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance. However, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic representations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning pathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these issues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that constructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a self-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations. Specifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook (MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby constructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance the reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement stage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a Multi-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions tailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA introduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization. During inference, Consistency-Oriented Self-Reflection for Pruning (CORP) is proposed to discard inconsistent reasoning paths, preventing the propagation of erroneous reasoning. Lastly, we develop an efficient offline training strategy for large-scale recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets and online evaluations show that REG4Rec delivers outstanding performance and substantial practical value.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCoTER: Structured Chain-of-Thought Transfer for Enhanced Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19514v4)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Harnessing the reasoning power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommender systems is hindered by two fundamental challenges. First, current approaches lack a mechanism for automated, data-driven discovery of effective reasoning patterns, relying instead on brittle manual templates or unstable zero-shot prompting. Second, they employ structure-collapsing integration: direct prompting incurs prohibitive online inference costs, while feature extraction collapses reasoning chains into single vectors, discarding stepwise logic. To address these challenges, we propose SCoTER (Structured Chain-of-Thought Transfer for Enhanced Recommendation), a unified framework that treats pattern discovery and structure-aware transfer as a jointly optimized problem. Specifically, SCoTER operationalizes this through two synergistic components: a GVM pipeline for automated pattern discovery and a structure-preserving integration architecture that transfers stepwise logic to efficient models. Formally, we provide information-theoretic justification proving that structure-preserving transfer achieves tighter performance bounds than structure-agnostic alternatives. Empirically, experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate improvements of 3.75\%-11.59\% over a strong TIGER backbone. Moreover, in production deployment on the Tencent Advertising Platform, SCoTER achieved a 2.14\% lift in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) while eliminating online LLM inference costs. Overall, SCoTER establishes a principled and production-validated blueprint for transferring structured LLM reasoning to large-scale recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Behavioral Fabric of LLM-Powered GUI Agents: Human Values and Interaction Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16356v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-powered web GUI agents are increasingly automating everyday online tasks. Despite their popularity, little is known about how users' preferences and values impact agents' reasoning and behavior. In this work, we investigate how both explicit and implicit user preferences, as well as the underlying user values, influence agent decision-making and action trajectories. We built a controlled testbed of 14 common interactive web tasks, spanning shopping, travel, dining, and housing, each replicated from real websites and integrated with a low-fidelity LLM-based recommender system. We injected 12 human preferences and values as personas into four state-of-the-art agents and systematically analyzed their task behaviors. Our results show that preference and value-infused prompts consistently guided agents toward outcomes that reflected these preferences and values. While the absence of user preference or value guidance led agents to exhibit a strong efficiency bias and employ shortest-path strategies, their presence steered agents' behavior trajectories through the greater use of corresponding filters and interactive web features. Despite their influence, dominant interface cues, such as discounts and advertisements, frequently overrode these effects, shortening the agents' action trajectories and inducing rationalizations that masked rather than reflected value-consistent reasoning. The contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) an open-source testbed for studying the influence of values in agent behaviors, and (2) an empirical investigation of how user preferences and values shape web agent behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling and Simulating Short-Video Addiction Behaviors via Economic Addiction Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15975v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Short-video applications have attracted substantial user traffic. However, these platforms also foster problematic usage patterns, commonly referred to as short-video addiction, which pose risks to both user health and the sustainable development of platforms. Prior studies on this issue have primarily relied on questionnaires or volunteer-based data collection, which are often limited by small sample sizes and population biases. In contrast, short-video platforms have large-scale behavioral data, offering a valuable foundation for analyzing addictive behaviors. To examine addiction-aware behavior patterns, we combine economic addiction theory with users' implicit behavior captured by recommendation systems. Our analysis shows that short-video addiction follows functional patterns similar to traditional forms of addictive behavior (e.g., substance abuse) and that its intensity is consistent with findings from previous social science studies. To develop a simulator that can learn and model these patterns, we introduce a novel training framework, AddictSim. To consider the personalized addiction patterns, AddictSim uses a mean-to-adapted strategy with group relative policy optimization training. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show that AddictSim consistently outperforms existing training strategies. Our simulation results show that integrating diversity-aware algorithms can mitigate addictive behaviors well.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in TheWebConf 2026</p></details> |

While MM has demonstrated success in domains like computer vision, its role in recommender systems (RSs) remains largely unexplored. Recently, Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in RSs, characterized by rapidly growing model scales and substantial computational costs, making MM particularly appealing for cost-sensitive deployment scenarios. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MM in GR through a contextual lens. We focus on a fundamental yet underexplored challenge in real-world: how to merge generative recommenders specialized to different real-world contexts, arising from temporal evolving user behaviors and heterogeneous application domains. To this end, we propose a unified framework MMGRid, a structured contextual grid of GR checkpoints that organizes models trained under diverse contexts induced by temporal evolution and domain diversity. All checkpoints are derived from a shared base LLM but fine-tuned on context-specific data, forming a realistic and controlled model space for systematically analyzing MM across GR paradigms and merging algorithms. Our investigation reveals several key insights. First, training GR models from LLMs can introduce parameter conflicts during merging due to token distribution shifts and objective disparities; such conflicts can be alleviated by disentangling task-aware and context-specific parameter changes via base model replacement. Second, incremental training across contexts induces recency bias, which can be effectively balanced through weighted contextual merging. Notably, we observe that optimal merging weights correlate with context-dependent interaction characteristics, offering practical guidance for weight selection in real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Joinn99/MMGRid</p></details> |
| **[Cohesive Group Discovery in Interaction Graphs under Explicit Density Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04174v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering cohesive groups is a fundamental primitive in graph-based recommender systems, underpinning tasks such as social recommendation, bundle discovery, and community-aware modeling. In interaction graphs, cohesion is often modeled as the $γ$-quasi-clique, an induced subgraph whose internal edge density meets a user-defined threshold $γ$. This formulation provides explicit control over within-group connectivity while accommodating the sparsity inherent in real-world data. This paper presents EDQC, an effective framework for cohesive group discovery under explicit density constraints. EDQC leverages a lightweight energy diffusion process to rank vertices for localizing promising candidate regions. Guided by this ranking, the framework extracts and refines a candidate subgraph to ensure the output strictly satisfies the target density requirement. Extensive experiments on 75 real-world graphs across varying density thresholds demonstrate that EDQC identifies the largest mean $γ$-quasi-cliques in the vast majority of cases, achieving lower variance than the state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive runtime. Furthermore, statistical analysis confirms that EDQC significantly outperforms the baselines, underscoring its robustness and practical utility for cohesive group discovery in graph-based recommender systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[CoNRec: Context-Discerning Negative Recommendation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15721v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding what users like is relatively straightforward; understanding what users dislike, however, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. Research into users' negative preferences has gained increasing importance in modern recommendation systems. Numerous platforms have introduced explicit negative feedback mechanisms and leverage such signals to refine their recommendation models. Beyond traditional business metrics, user experience-driven metrics, such as negative feedback rates, have become critical indicators for evaluating system performance. However, most existing approaches primarily use negative feedback as an auxiliary signal to enhance positive recommendations, paying little attention to directly modeling negative interests, which can be highly valuable in offline applications. Moreover, due to the inherent sparsity of negative feedback data, models often suffer from context understanding biases induced by positive feedback dominance. To address these challenges, we propose the first large language model framework for negative feedback modeling with special designed context-discerning modules. We use semantic ID Representation to replace text-based item descriptions and introduce an item-level alignment task that enhances the LLM's understanding of the semantic context behind negative feedback. Furthermore, we design a Progressive GRPO training paradigm that enables the model to dynamically balance the positive and negative behavioral context utilization. Besides, our investigation further reveals a fundamental misalignment between the conventional next-negative-item prediction objective and users' true negative preferences, which is heavily influenced by the system's recommendation order. To mitigate this, we propose a novel reward function and evaluation metric grounded in multi-day future negative feedback and their collaborative signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Product Attribute Labeling with Vision-Language Models: A Three-Tier Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15711v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained attribute prediction is essential for fashion retail applications including catalog enrichment, visual search, and recommendation systems. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer zero-shot prediction without task-specific training, yet their systematic evaluation on multi-attribute fashion tasks remains underexplored. A key challenge is that fashion attributes are often conditional. For example, "outer fabric" is undefined when no outer garment is visible. This requires models to detect attribute applicability before attempting classification. We introduce a three-tier evaluation framework that decomposes this challenge: (1) overall task performance across all classes (including NA class: suggesting attribute is not applicable) for all attributes, (2) attribute applicability detection, and (3) fine-grained classification when attributes are determinable. Using DeepFashion-MultiModal, which explicitly defines NA (meaning attribute doesn't exist or is not visible) within attribute label spaces, we benchmark nine VLMs spanning flagship (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), efficient (GPT-5 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash), and ultra-efficient tiers (GPT-5 Nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite) against classifiers trained on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings on 5,000 images across 18 attributes. Our findings reveal that: (1) zero-shot VLMs achieve 64.0% macro-F1, a threefold improvement over logistic regression on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings; (2) VLMs excel at fine-grained classification (Tier 3: 70.8% F1) but struggle with applicability detection (Tier 2: 34.1% NA-F1), identifying a key bottleneck; (3) efficient models achieve over 90% of flagship performance at lower cost, offering practical deployment paths. This diagnostic framework enables practitioners to pinpoint whether errors stem from visibility detection or classification, guiding targeted improvements for production systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026 Workshop on Physical Retail AI (PRAW)</p></details> |
| **[iTIMO: An LLM-empowered Synthesis Dataset for Travel Itinerary Modification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10609v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Addressing itinerary modification is crucial for enhancing the travel experience as it is a frequent requirement during traveling. However, existing research mainly focuses on fixed itinerary planning, leaving modification underexplored due to the scarcity of need-to-modify itinerary data. To bridge this gap, we formally define the itinerary modification task and propose a general pipeline to construct the corresponding dataset, namely iTIMO. This pipeline frames the generation of need-to-modify itinerary data as an intent-driven perturbation task. It instructs large language models to perturb real-world itineraries using three operations: REPLACE, ADD, and DELETE. Each perturbation is grounded in three intents: disruptions of popularity, spatial distance, and category diversity. Furthermore, hybrid evaluation metrics are introduced to ensure perturbation effectiveness. We conduct comprehensive benchmarking on iTIMO to analyze the capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs. Overall, iTIMO provides a comprehensive testbed for the modification task, and empowers the evolution of traditional travel recommender systems into adaptive frameworks capable of handling dynamic travel needs. Dataset, code and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/zelo2/iTIMO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Bayesian Personalized Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11067v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pairwise learning underpins implicit collaborative filtering, yet its effectiveness is often hindered by sparse supervision, noisy interactions, and popularity-driven exposure bias. In this paper, we propose Variational Bayesian Personalized Ranking (VarBPR), a tractable variational framework for implicit-feedback pairwise learning that offers principled exposure controllability and theoretical interpretability. VarBPR reformulates pairwise learning as variational inference over discrete latent indexing variables, explicitly modeling noise and indexing uncertainty, and divides training into two stages: variational inference and variational learning. In the variational inference stage, we develop a variational formulation that integrates preference alignment, denoising, and popularity debiasing under a unified ELBO/regularization objective, deriving closed-form posteriors with clear control semantics: the prior encodes a target exposure pattern, while temperature/regularization strength controls posterior-prior adherence. As a result, exposure controllability becomes an endogenous and interpretable outcome of variational inference. In the variational learning stage, we propose a posterior-compression objective that reduces the ideal ELBO's computational complexity from polynomial to linear, with the approximation justified by an explicit Jensen-gap upper bound. Theoretically, we provide interpretable generalization guarantees by identifying a structural error component and revealing the opportunity cost of prioritizing certain exposure patterns (e.g., long-tail), offering a concrete analytical lens for designing controllable recommender systems. Empirically, we validate VarBPR across popular backbones; it demonstrates consistent gains in ranking accuracy, enables controlled long-tail exposure, and preserves the linear-time complexity of BPR.</p></details> | 16 pages |

To address this, we propose RecLM, a unified framework that bridges the gap between retrieval and generation by instantiating three grounding paradigms under a single architecture: embedding-based retrieval, constrained generation over rewritten item titles, and discrete item-tokenizer generation. Using the same backbone LLM and prompts, we systematically compare these three views on public benchmarks. RecLM strictly eradicates OOD recommendations (OOD@10 = 0) across all variants, and the constrained generation variants RecLM-cgen and RecLM-token achieve overall state-of-the-art accuracy compared to both strong ID-based and LLM-based baselines. Our unified view provides a systematic basis for comparing three distinct paradigms to reduce item hallucinations, offering a practical framework to facilitate the application of LLMs to recommendation tasks.

It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, encompassing implicit feedback such as clicked items and explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed by novel privacy attacks. However, no study has been conducted on this important issue. We design several membership inference attacks (MIAs) aimed to revealing whether system prompts include victims' historical interactions. The attacks are \emph{Similarity, Memorization, Inquiry, and Poisoning attacks}, each utilizing unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on five of the latest open-source LLMs and three well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat to LLM RecSys is realistic: inquiry and poisoning attacks show significantly high attack advantages. We also discussed possible methods to mitigate such MIA threats. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts, the position of the victim in the shots, the number of poisoning items in the prompt,etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is paper is under review ACL 2026</p></details> |

We introduce prompt recommender systems (PRS) as an interaction approach that supports exploration, suggesting contextually relevant follow-up prompts. We present PromptHelper, a PRS prototype integrated into an AI chatbot that surfaces semantically diverse prompt suggestions while users work on real writing tasks. We evaluate PromptHelper in a 2x2 fully within-subjects study (N=32) across creative and academic writing tasks. Results show that PromptHelper significantly increases users' perceived exploration and expressiveness without increasing cognitive workload. Qualitative findings illustrate how prompt recommendations help users branch into new directions, overcome uncertainty about what to ask next, and better articulate their intent. We discuss implications for designing AI interfaces that scaffold exploratory interaction while preserving user agency, and release open-source resources to support research on prompt recommendation.</p></details> |  |

The system clusters behavior windows into behavioral archetypes and uses binary confidence gating to activate archetype-based scoring only when confidence exceeds a threshold, falling back to baseline predictions when uncertain. We validate Lattice on recommendation systems (MovieLens), scientific time-series (LIGO), and financial markets, using LSTM and transformer backbones. On MovieLens with LSTM, Lattice achieves +31.9% improvement over LSTM baseline in HR@10 (p < 3.29 x 10^-25, 30 seeds), outperforming transformer baselines by 109.4% over SASRec and 218.6% over BERT4Rec. On LIGO and financial data, the system correctly refuses archetype activation when distribution shift occurs - a successful outcome demonstrating confidence gating prevents false activation. On transformer backbones, Lattice provides 0.0% improvement (neutral, no degradation), gracefully deferring when structure is already present. This bidirectional validation - activating when patterns apply, refusing when they don't, and deferring when redundant - supports confidence gating as a promising architectural principle for managing epistemic uncertainty in safety-critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 figure, uses tikz.sty</p></details> |
| **[From Insight to Intervention: Interpretable Neuron Steering for Controlling Popularity Bias in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15122v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popularity bias is a pervasive challenge in recommender systems, where a few popular items dominate attention while the majority of less popular items remain underexposed. This imbalance can reduce recommendation quality and lead to unfair item exposure. Although existing mitigation methods address this issue to some extent, they often lack transparency in how they operate. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc approach, PopSteer, that leverages a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to both interpret and mitigate popularity bias in recommendation models. The SAE is trained to replicate a trained model's behavior while enabling neuron-level interpretability. By introducing synthetic users with strong preferences for either popular or unpopular items, we identify neurons encoding popularity signals through their activation patterns. We then steer recommendations by adjusting the activations of the most biased neurons. Experiments on three public datasets with a sequential recommendation model demonstrate that PopSteer significantly enhances fairness with minimal impact on accuracy, while providing interpretable insights and fine-grained control over the fairness-accuracy trade-off.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAQ: Pushing the Limits of Vector Quantization through Code Adjustment and Dimension Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12086v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays a critical role in applications such as search engines, recommender systems, and RAG for LLMs. Vector quantization (VQ), a crucial technique for ANNS, is commonly used to reduce space overhead and accelerate distance computations. However, despite significant research advances, state-of-the-art VQ methods still face challenges in balancing encoding efficiency and quantization accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VQ method called SAQ. To improve accuracy, SAQ employs a new dimension segmentation technique to strategically partition PCA-projected vectors into segments along their dimensions. By prioritizing leading dimension segments with larger magnitudes, SAQ allocates more bits to high-impact segments, optimizing the use of the available space quota. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed to optimize dimension segmentation and bit allocation, ensuring minimal quantization error. To speed up vector encoding, SAQ devises a code adjustment technique to first quantize each dimension independently and then progressively refine quantized vectors using a coordinate-descent-like approach to avoid exhaustive enumeration. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAQ's superiority over classical methods (e.g., PQ, PCA) and recent state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., LVQ, Extended RabitQ). SAQ achieves up to 80% reduction in quantization error and accelerates encoding speed by over 80x compared to Extended RabitQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, accepted by SIGMOD</p></details> |

However, current AI-based TCM formula recommendation models and methods mainly focus on data-based textual associations between symptoms and herbs, and have not fully utilized their features and relations at different scales, especially at the molecular scale. To address these limitations, we propose the Fusion of Multiscale Associations of Symptoms and Herbs (FMASH), an novel framework that effectively combines molecular-scale features and macroscopic properties of herbs with clinical symptoms, and provides the refined representation of their multiscale associations, enhancing the effectiveness of TCM formula recommendation. This framework can integrate molecular-scale chemical features and macroscopic properties of herbs, and capture complex local and global relations in the heterogeneous graph of symptoms and herbs, providing the effective embedding representation of their multiscale features and associations in a unified semantic space. Based on the refined feature representation, the framework is not only compatible with both traditional unordered formula recommendation task and the ordered herb sequence generation task, but also improves model's performance in both tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate FMASH's superior performance on the TCM formula recommendation over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline, achieving relative improvements of 9.45\% in Precision@5, 12.11% in Recall@5, and 11.01% in F1@5 compared to the SOTA model on benchmark datasets. This work facilitates the practical application of AI-based TCM formula recommendation system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Fairness and High Match Rates in Reciprocal Recommender Systems: A Nash Social Welfare Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13609v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matching platforms, such as online dating services and job recommendations, have become increasingly prevalent. For the success of these platforms, it is crucial to design reciprocal recommender systems (RRSs) that not only increase the total number of matches but also avoid creating unfairness among users. In this paper, we investigate the fairness of RRSs on matching platforms. From the perspective of fair division, we define the users' opportunities to be recommended and establish the fairness concept of envy-freeness in the allocation of these opportunities. We first introduce the Social Welfare (SW) method, which approximately maximizes the number of matches, and show that it leads to significant unfairness in recommendation opportunities, illustrating the trade-off between fairness and match rates. To address this challenge, we propose the Nash Social Welfare (NSW) method, which alternately optimizes two NSW functions and achieves nearly envy-free recommendations. We further generalize the SW and NSW method to the $α$-SW method, which balances the trade-off between fairness and high match rates. Additionally, we develop a computationally efficient approximation algorithm for the SW/NSW/$α$-SW methods based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.00720</p></details> |
| **[Integrating Vision-Centric Text Understanding for Conversational Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13505v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have attracted growing attention for their ability to deliver personalized recommendations through natural language interactions. To more accurately infer user preferences from multi-turn conversations, recent works increasingly expand conversational context (e.g., by incorporating diverse entity information or retrieving related dialogues). While such context enrichment can assist preference modeling, it also introduces longer and more heterogeneous inputs, leading to practical issues such as input length constraints, text style inconsistency, and irrelevant textual noise, thereby raising the demand for stronger language understanding ability. In this paper, we propose STARCRS, a Screen-Text-AwaRe Conversational Recommender System that integrates two complementary text understanding modes: (1) a screen-reading pathway that encodes auxiliary textual information as visual tokens, mimicking skim reading on a screen, and (2) an LLM-based textual pathway that focuses on a limited set of critical content for fine-grained reasoning. We design a knowledge-anchored fusion framework that combines contrastive alignment, cross-attention interaction, and adaptive gating to integrate the two modes for improved preference modeling and response generation. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that STARCRS consistently improves both recommendation accuracy and generated response quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling and Mitigating Bias in Large Language Model Recommendations: A Path to Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10825v4)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommendation systems excel in delivering comprehensive suggestions by deeply analyzing content and user behavior. However, they often inherit biases from skewed training data, favoring mainstream content while underrepresenting diverse or non-traditional options. This study explores the interplay between bias and LLM-based recommendation systems, focusing on music, song, and book recommendations across diverse demographic and cultural groups. This paper analyzes bias in LLM-based recommendation systems across multiple models (GPT, LLaMA, and Gemini), revealing its deep and pervasive impact on outcomes. Intersecting identities and contextual factors, like socioeconomic status, further amplify biases, complicating fair recommendations across diverse groups. Our findings reveal that bias in these systems is deeply ingrained, yet even simple interventions like prompt engineering can significantly reduce it. We further propose a retrieval-augmented generation strategy to mitigate bias more effectively. Numerical experiments validate these strategies, demonstrating both the pervasive nature of bias and the impact of the proposed solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Unfairness of Multifactorial Bias in Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12828v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popularity bias and positivity bias are two prominent sources of bias in recommender systems. Both arise from input data, propagate through recommendation models, and lead to unfair or suboptimal outcomes. Popularity bias occurs when a small subset of items receives most interactions, while positivity bias stems from the over-representation of high rating values. Although each bias has been studied independently, their combined effect, to which we refer to as multifactorial bias, remains underexplored. In this work, we examine how multifactorial bias influences item-side fairness, focusing on exposure bias, which reflects the unequal visibility of items in recommendation outputs. Through simulation studies, we find that positivity bias is disproportionately concentrated on popular items, further amplifying their over-exposure. Motivated by this insight, we adapt a percentile-based rating transformation as a pre-processing strategy to mitigate multifactorial bias. Experiments using six recommendation algorithms across four public datasets show that this approach improves exposure fairness with negligible accuracy loss. We also demonstrate that integrating this pre-processing step into post-processing fairness pipelines enhances their effectiveness and efficiency, enabling comparable or better fairness with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance of addressing multifactorial bias and demonstrate the practical value of simple, data-driven pre-processing methods for improving fairness in recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

Yet existing approaches remain fragmented across methodological paradigms, and it remains unclear which methods best capture community-specific notions of value. We introduce VASTU (Value-Aligned Social Toolkit for Online Content Curation), a benchmark and evaluation framework for systematically comparing approaches to detecting community-valued content. VASTU includes a dataset of 75,000 comments from 15 diverse Reddit communities, annotated with community approval labels and rich linguistic features. Using VASTU, we evaluate feature-based models, transformers, prompted and fine-tuned language models under global versus community-specific training regimes. We find that community-specific models consistently outperform global approaches, with fine-tuned transformers achieving the strongest performance (0.72 AUROC). Notably, fine-tuned SLMs (0.65 AUROC) substantially outperform prompted LLMs (0.60 AUROC) despite being 100 times smaller. Counterintuitively, chain-of-thought prompting provides no benefit, and reasoning models perform the worst (0.53 AUROC), suggesting this task requires learning community norms rather than test-time reasoning. By releasing VASTU, we provide a standardized benchmark to advance research on value-aligned sociotechnical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint: 15 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Semantic Understanding and Popularity Bias with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09478v3)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic understanding of popularity bias is a crucial yet underexplored challenge in recommender systems, where popular items are often favored at the expense of niche content. Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as "diversity" or "debiasing", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias. The implementation is available at https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairLRM.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figs, WWW 2026 accepted</p></details> |

However, existing LLM-based simulators for RSs face two major limitations: (1) static and single-step prompt-based inference that leads to inaccurate and incomplete user profile construction; (2) unrealistic and single-round recommendation-feedback interaction pattern that fails to capture real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DGDPO (Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization), a novel framework that constructs user profile through a dynamic and iterative optimization process to enhance the simulation fidelity. Specifically, DGDPO incorporates two core modules within each optimization loop: firstly, a specialized LLM-based diagnostic module, calibrated through our novel training strategy, accurately identifies specific defects in the user profile. Subsequently, a generalized LLM-based treatment module analyzes the diagnosed defect and generates targeted suggestions to refine the profile. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM-based user simulators that are limited to single-round interactions, we are the first to integrate DGDPO with sequential recommenders, enabling a bidirectional evolution where user profiles and recommendation strategies adapt to each other over multi-round interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

While their capabilities are well-documented, their robustness against adversarial manipulation in competitive ranking scenarios remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we uncover a critical vulnerability in VLM-based product search: multimodal ranking attacks. We present Multimodal Generative Engine Optimization (MGEO), a novel adversarial framework that enables a malicious actor to unfairly promote a target product by jointly optimizing imperceptible image perturbations and fluent textual suffixes. Unlike existing attacks that treat modalities in isolation, MGEO employs an alternating gradient-based optimization strategy to exploit the deep cross-modal coupling within the VLM. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets using state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our coordinated attack significantly outperforms text-only and image-only baselines. These findings reveal that multimodal synergy, typically a strength of VLMs, can be weaponized to compromise the integrity of search rankings without triggering conventional content filters.</p></details> |  |

While promising, transformers' computational cost scales quadratically with the user sequence length and linearly with the number of candidates. This trade-off makes it prohibitively expensive to expand candidate sets or increase sequence length at inference, despite the significant performance improvements. We introduce \textbf{LIME}, a novel architecture that resolves this trade-off. Through two key innovations, LIME fundamentally reduces computational complexity. First, low-rank ``link embeddings" enable pre-computation of attention weights by decoupling user and candidate interactions, making the inference cost nearly independent of candidate set size. Second, a linear attention mechanism, \textbf{LIME-XOR}, reduces the complexity with respect to user sequence length from quadratic ($O(N^2)$) to linear ($O(N)$). Experiments on public and industrial datasets show LIME achieves near-parity with state-of-the-art transformers but with a 10$\times$ inference speedup on large candidate sets or long sequence lengths. When tested on a major recommendation platform, LIME improved user engagement while maintaining minimal inference costs with respect to candidate set size and user history length, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and expressive recommendation systems.</p></details> | 19 pages |

To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison aligned with the evolving demands of modern recommendation systems, we adopt a Requirement-Oriented Benchmarking (ROB) framework that structures evaluation around predictive accuracy, recommendation diversity, relational awareness, temporal dynamics, and computational efficiency. Under a unified evaluation protocol, models are assessed using standard accuracy-oriented metrics alongside diversity and efficiency indicators. Experimental results show that different architectures exhibit complementary strengths across requirements, motivating the use of hybrid and ensemble designs. The findings provide practical guidance for selecting and combining neural architectures to better satisfy multi-objective recommendation system requirements.</p></details> |  |

To address this problem, we propose a context-aware user profiling framework with two trainable components: a query generator that generates optimal queries to retrieve persuasion-relevant records from a user's history, and a profiler that summarizes these records into a profile to effectively inform the persuasiveness prediction model. Our evaluation on the ChangeMyView Reddit dataset shows consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple predictor models, with gains of up to +13.77%p in F1 score. Further analysis shows that effective user profiles are context-dependent and predictor-specific, rather than relying on static attributes or surface-level similarity. Together, these results highlight the importance of task-oriented, context-dependent user profiling for personalized persuasiveness prediction.</p></details> |  |

Yet existing agents rely on isolated memory, overlooking crucial collaborative signals. Bridging this gap is hindered by the dual challenges of distilling vast graph contexts without overwhelming reasoning agents with cognitive load, and evolving the collaborative memory efficiently without incurring prohibitive computational costs. To address this, we propose MemRec, a framework that architecturally decouples reasoning from memory management to enable efficient collaborative augmentation. MemRec introduces a dedicated, cost-effective LM_Mem to manage a dynamic collaborative memory graph, serving synthesized, high-signal context to a downstream LLM_Rec. The framework operates via a practical pipeline featuring efficient retrieval and cost-effective asynchronous graph propagation that evolves memory in the background. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that MemRec achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, architectural analysis confirms its flexibility, establishing a new Pareto frontier that balances reasoning quality, cost, and privacy through support for diverse deployments, including local open-source models.

Each user maintains a local social network centered around themselves, resulting in a naturally distributed social structure. Recent research on distributed modeling for social recommender systems has gained increasing attention, as it naturally aligns with the user-centric structure of user interactions. Current distributed social recommender systems rely on automatically combining predictions from multiple models, often overlooking the user's active role in validating whether suggested connections are appropriate. Moreover, recommendation decisions are validated by individual users rather than derived from a single global ordering of candidates. As a result, standard ranking-based evaluation metrics make it difficult to evaluate whether a user-confirmed recommendation decision is actually correct. To address these limitations, we propose DeSocial, a distributed social recommendation framework with user-validation. DeSocial enables users to select recommendation algorithms to validate their potential connections, and the verification is processed through majority consensus among multiple independent user validators. To evaluate the distributed recommender system with user validator, we formulate this setting as a link prediction and verification task and introduce Acc@K, a consensus-based evaluation metric that measures whether user-approved recommendations are correct. Experiments on 4 real-world social networks shows that DeSocial improves decision correctness and robustness compared to single-point and distributed baselines. These findings highlight the potential of user-validated distributed recommender systems as a practical approach to social recommendation, with broader applicability to distributed and decentralized recommendations.

Traditional BERT embeddings suffer from anisotropic representation spaces, where course descriptions exhibit high cosine similarities regardless of semantic relevance. To address this limitation, we propose a contrastive learning framework with data augmentation and isotropy regularization that produces more discriminative embeddings. Our system processes student text queries and recommends Top-N relevant courses from a curated dataset of over 500 engineering courses across multiple faculties. Experimental results demonstrate that our fine-tuned model achieves improved embedding separation and more accurate course recommendations compared to vanilla BERT baselines.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

Despite notable advancements, existing approaches still face two critical limitations: first, shallow modality fusion often relies on simple concatenation, failing to exploit rich synergic intra- and inter-modal relationships; second, asymmetric feature treatment-where users are only characterized by interaction IDs while items benefit from rich multimodal content-hinders the learning of a shared semantic space. To address these issues, we propose a Cross-modal Recursive Attention Network with dual graph Embedding (CRANE). To tackle shallow fusion, we design a core Recursive Cross-Modal Attention (RCA) mechanism that iteratively refines modality features based on cross-correlations in a joint latent space, effectively capturing high-order intra- and inter-modal dependencies. For symmetric multimodal learning, we explicitly construct users' multimodal profiles by aggregating features of their interacted items. Furthermore, CRANE integrates a symmetric dual-graph framework-comprising a heterogeneous user-item interaction graph and a homogeneous item-item semantic graph-unified by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to fuse behavioral and semantic signals. Despite these complex modeling capabilities, CRANE maintains high computational efficiency. Theoretical and empirical analyses confirm its scalability and high practical efficiency, achieving faster convergence on small datasets and superior performance ceilings on large-scale ones. Comprehensive experiments on four public real-world datasets validate an average 5% improvement in key metrics over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM)</p></details> |
| **[Bid Farewell to Seesaw: Towards Accurate Long-tail Session-based Recommendation via Dual Constraints of Hybrid Intents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08378v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict anonymous users' next interaction based on their interaction sessions. In the practical recommendation scenario, low-exposure items constitute the majority of interactions, creating a long-tail distribution that severely compromises recommendation diversity. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by promoting tail items but incur accuracy degradation, exhibiting a "see-saw" effect between long-tail and accuracy performance. We attribute such conflict to session-irrelevant noise within the tail items, which existing long-tail approaches fail to identify and constrain effectively. To resolve this fundamental conflict, we propose \textbf{HID} (\textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{I}ntent-based \textbf{D}ual Constraint Framework), a plug-and-play framework that transforms the conventional "see-saw" into "win-win" through introducing the hybrid intent-based dual constraints for both long-tail and accuracy. Two key innovations are incorporated in this framework: (i) \textit{Hybrid Intent Learning}, where we reformulate the intent extraction strategies by employing attribute-aware spectral clustering to reconstruct the item-to-intent mapping. Furthermore, discrimination of session-irrelevant noise is achieved through the assignment of the target and noise intents to each session. (ii) \textit{Intent Constraint Loss}, which incorporates two novel constraint paradigms regarding the \textit{diversity} and \textit{accuracy} to regulate the representation learning process of both items and sessions. These two objectives are unified into a single training loss through rigorous theoretical derivation. Extensive experiments across multiple SBR models and datasets demonstrate that HID can enhance both long-tail performance and recommendation accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in long-tail recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI 2026 Oral</p></details> |

However, existing graph unlearning methods often modify nodes or edges indiscriminately, overlooking their impact on fairness. For instance, forgetting links between users of different genders may inadvertently exacerbate group disparities. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that jointly optimizes both the graph structure and the model to achieve fair unlearning. Our method rewires the graph by removing redundant edges that hinder forgetting while preserving fairness through targeted edge augmentation. We further introduce a worst-case evaluation mechanism to assess robustness under challenging scenarios. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach achieves more effective and fair unlearning than existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>CIKM ...</summary><p>CIKM 2025; v2 fixes author list</p></details> |
| **[EncodeRec: An Embedding Backbone for Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10837v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent recommender systems increasingly leverage embeddings from large pre-trained language models (PLMs). However, such embeddings exhibit two key limitations: (1) PLMs are not explicitly optimized to produce structured and discriminative embedding spaces, and (2) their representations remain overly generic, often failing to capture the domain-specific semantics crucial for recommendation tasks. We present EncodeRec, an approach designed to align textual representations with recommendation objectives while learning compact, informative embeddings directly from item descriptions. EncodeRec keeps the language model parameters frozen during recommender system training, making it computationally efficient without sacrificing semantic fidelity. Experiments across core recommendation benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness both as a backbone for sequential recommendation models and for semantic ID tokenization, showing substantial gains over PLM-based and embedding model baselines. These results underscore the pivotal role of embedding adaptation in bridging the gap between general-purpose language models and practical recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PADER: Paillier-based Secure Decentralized Social Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10212v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevalence of recommendation systems also brings privacy concerns to both the users and the sellers, as centralized platforms collect as much data as possible from them. To keep the data private, we propose PADER: a Paillier-based secure decentralized social recommendation system. In this system, the users and the sellers are nodes in a decentralized network. The training and inference of the recommendation model are carried out securely in a decentralized manner, without the involvement of a centralized platform. To this end, we apply the Paillier cryptosystem to the SoReg (Social Regularization) model, which exploits both user's ratings and social relations. We view the SoReg model as a two-party secure polynomial evaluation problem and observe that the simple bipartite computation may result in poor efficiency. To improve efficiency, we design secure addition and multiplication protocols to support secure computation on any arithmetic circuit, along with an optimal data packing scheme that is suitable for the polynomial computations of real values. Experiment results show that our method only takes about one second to iterate through one user with hundreds of ratings, and training with ~500K ratings for one epoch only takes <3 hours, which shows that the method is practical in real applications.

| **[ShuffleGate: Scalable Feature Optimization for Recommender Systems via Batch-wise Sensitivity Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09315v4)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature optimization, specifically Feature Selection (FS) and Dimension Selection (DS), is critical for the efficiency and generalization of large-scale recommender systems. While conceptually related, these tasks are typically tackled with isolated solutions that often suffer from ambiguous importance scores or prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we propose ShuffleGate, a unified and interpretable mechanism that estimates component importance by measuring the model's sensitivity to information loss. Unlike conventional gating that learns relative weights, ShuffleGate introduces a batch-wise shuffling strategy to effectively erase information in an end-to-end differentiable manner. This paradigm shift yields naturally polarized importance distributions, bridging the long-standing "search-retrain gap" and distinguishing essential signals from noise without complex threshold tuning. ShuffleGate provides a unified solution across granularities. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on feature and dimension selection tasks. Furthermore, to demonstrate its extreme scalability and precision, we extend ShuffleGate to evaluate fine-grained embedding entries. Experiments show it can identify and prune 99.9% of redundant embedding parameters on the Criteo dataset while maintaining competitive AUC, verifying its robustness in massive search spaces. Finally, the method has been successfully deployed in a top-tier industrial video recommendation platform. By compressing the concatenated input dimension from over 10,000 to 1,000+, it achieved a 91% increase in training throughput while serving billions of daily requests without performance degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Content-based Recommendation Model Training via Noise-aware Coreset Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10067v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Content-based recommendation systems (CRSs) utilize content features to predict user-item interactions, serving as essential tools for helping users navigate information-rich web services. However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions. Through extensive experiments, we show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques. Notably, NaCS recovers 93-95\% of full-dataset training performance using merely 1\% of the training data.

To better respond real-time user feedback, we have deployed an interactive recommender system (IRS) alongside our core homepage recommender system. This IRS is triggered by user click on homepage, and generates a series of highly relevant recommendations based on the clicked item to meet focused browsing demands. Different from traditional e-commerce RecSys, the full-screen UI and immersive swiping down functionality present two distinct challenges for regular ranking system. First, there exists explicit interference (overlap or conflicts) between ranking objectives, i.e., conversion, view and swipe down. This is because there are intrinsic behavioral co-occurrences under the premise of immersive browsing and swiping down functionality. Second, the ranking system is prone to temporal greedy traps in sequential recommendation slot transitions, which is caused by full-screen UI design. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a novel Spatio-temporal collaborative ranking (STCRank) framework to achieve collaboration between multi-objectives within one slot (spatial) and between multiple sequential recommondation slots. In multi-objective collaboration (MOC) module, we push Pareto frontier by mitigating the objective overlaps and conflicts. In multi-slot collaboration (MSC) module, we achieve global optima on overall sequential slots by dual-stage look-ahead ranking mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed method brings about purchase and DAU co-growth. The proposed system has been already deployed at Kuaishou E-shop since 2025.6.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an oral paper by WWW26 Human-centered recommender systems (HCRS) workshop (https://hcrec.github.io/)</p></details> |
| **[Why not Collaborative Filtering in Dual View? Bridging Sparse and Dense Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09286v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative Filtering (CF) remains the cornerstone of modern recommender systems, with dense embedding--based methods dominating current practice. However, these approaches suffer from a critical limitation: our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ceiling when modeling unpopular items, where parameter-based dense models experience diminishing SNR under severe data sparsity. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SaD (Sparse and Dense), a unified framework that integrates the semantic expressiveness of dense embeddings with the structural reliability of sparse interaction patterns. We theoretically show that aligning these dual views yields a strictly superior global SNR. Concretely, SaD introduces a lightweight bidirectional alignment mechanism: the dense view enriches the sparse view by injecting semantic correlations, while the sparse view regularizes the dense model through explicit structural signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under this dual-view alignment, even a simple matrix factorization--style dense model can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, SaD is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of existing recommender models, highlighting the enduring power of collaborative filtering when leveraged from dual perspectives. Further evaluations on real-world benchmarks show that SaD consistently outperforms strong baselines, ranking first on the BarsMatch leaderboard.

This multi-page architecture inherently establishes a two-stage interaction paradigm between the user and the platform: (1) Stage I: page navigation, navigating users to a specific page and (2) Stage II: in-page interaction, where users engage with customized content within the specific page. While the majority of research has been focusing on the sequential recommendation task that improves users' feedback in Stage II, there has been little investigation on how to achieve better page navigation in Stage I. To fill this gap, we formally define the task of Personalized Landing Page Modeling (PLPM) into the field of recommender systems: Given a user upon app entry, the goal of PLPM is to proactively select the most suitable landing page from a set of candidates (e.g., functional tabs, content channels, or aggregation pages) to optimize the short-term PDR metric and the long-term user engagement and satisfaction metrics, while adhering to industrial constraints. Additionally, we propose KLAN (Kuaishou Landing-page Adaptive Navigator), a hierarchical solution framework designed to provide personalized landing pages under the formulation of PLPM. KLAN comprises three key components: (1) KLAN-ISP captures inter-day static page preference; (2) KLAN-IIT captures intra-day dynamic interest transitions and (3) KLAN-AM adaptively integrates both components for optimal navigation decisions. Extensive online experiments conducted on the Kuaishou platform demonstrate the effectiveness of KLAN, obtaining +0.205% and +0.192% improvements on in Daily Active Users (DAU) and user Lifetime (LT). Our KLAN is ultimately deployed on the online platform at full traffic, serving hundreds of millions of users. To promote further research in this important area, we will release our dataset and code upon paper acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>We pr...</summary><p>We propose PLPM, a new task for selecting optimal landing pages upon user entry.

We introduce FastLane, a novel retrieval framework that dynamically routes queries to their most informative representations, eliminating redundant token comparisons. FastLane employs a learnable routing mechanism optimized alongside the embedding model, leveraging self-attention and differentiable selection to maximize efficiency. Our approach reduces computational complexity by up to 30x while maintaining competitive retrieval performance. By bridging late-interaction models with ANNS, FastLane enables scalable, low-latency retrieval, making it feasible for large-scale applications such as search engines, recommendation systems, and question-answering platforms. This work opens pathways for multi-lingual, multi-modal, and long-context retrieval, pushing the frontier of efficient and adaptive information retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[FusID: Modality-Fused Semantic IDs for Generative Music Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08764v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation systems have achieved significant advances by leveraging semantic IDs to represent items. However, existing approaches that tokenize each modality independently face two critical limitations: (1) redundancy across modalities that reduces efficiency, and (2) failure to capture inter-modal interactions that limits item representation. We introduce FusID, a modality-fused semantic ID framework that addresses these limitations through three key components: (i) multimodal fusion that learns unified representations by jointly encoding information across modalities, (ii) representation learning that brings frequently co-occurring item embeddings closer while maintaining distinctiveness and preventing feature redundancy, and (iii) product quantization that converts the fused continuous embeddings into multiple discrete tokens to mitigate ID conflict. Evaluated on a multimodal next-song recommendation (i.e., playlist continuation) benchmark, FusID achieves zero ID conflicts, ensuring that each token sequence maps to exactly one song, mitigates codebook underutilization, and outperforms baselines in terms of MRR and Recall@k (k = 1, 5, 10, 20).</p></details> |  |

However, existing models suffer from issues such as item interaction dominance and noisy sessions. We propose a multi-channel recommendation model, including a knowledge graph channel, a session hypergraph channel, and a session line graph channel, to capture information from multiple sources. Our model adaptively removes redundant edges in the knowledge graph channel to reduce noise. Knowledge graph representations cooperate with hypergraph representations for prediction to alleviate item dominance. We also generate in-session attention for denoising. Finally, we maximize mutual information between the hypergraph and line graph channels as an auxiliary task. Experiments demonstrate that our method enhances the accuracy of various recommendations, including e-commerce and multimedia recommendations. We release the code on GitHub for reproducibility.\footnote{https://github.com/hohehohe0509/DSR-HK}</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Sequential Recommendation under Latency and Memory Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08360v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommender systems must model long-range user behavior while operating under strict memory and latency constraints. Transformer-based approaches achieve strong accuracy but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, forcing aggressive truncation of user histories and limiting their practicality for long-horizon modeling. This paper presents HoloMambaRec, a lightweight sequential recommendation architecture that combines holographic reduced representations for attribute-aware embedding with a selective state space encoder for linear-time sequence processing. Item and attribute information are bound using circular convolution, preserving embedding dimensionality while encoding structured metadata. A shallow selective state space backbone, inspired by recent Mamba-style models, enables efficient training and constant-time recurrent inference. Experiments on Amazon Beauty and MovieLens-1M datasets demonstrate that HoloMambaRec consistently outperforms SASRec and achieves competitive performance with GRU4Rec under a constrained 10-epoch training budget, while maintaining substantially lower memory complexity. The design further incorporates forward-compatible mechanisms for temporal bundling and inference-time compression, positioning HoloMambaRec as a practical and extensible alternative for scalable, metadata-aware sequential recommendation.</p></details> |  |

However, there is still no consensus on how best to construct and utilize such profiles. To address this, we revisit recent profiling-based approaches in recommender systems along four dimensions: 1) knowledge base, 2) preference indicator, 3) impact range, and 4) subject. We argue that large language models (LLMs) are effective at extracting compressed rationales from diverse knowledge sources, while knowledge graphs (KGs) are better suited for propagating these profiles to extend their reach. Building on this insight, we propose a new recommendation model, called SPiKE. SPiKE consists of three core components: i) Entity profile generation, which uses LLMs to generate semantic profiles for all KG entities; ii) Profile-aware KG aggregation, which integrates these profiles into the KG; and iii) Pairwise profile preference matching, which aligns LLM- and KG-based representations during training. In experiments, we demonstrate that SPiKE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art KG- and LLM-based recommenders in real-world settings.</p></details> | Accepted at KDD 2026 |
| **[Nonparametric Kernel Clustering with Bandit Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07535v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering with bandit feedback refers to the problem of partitioning a set of items, where the clustering algorithm can sequentially query the items to receive noisy observations. The problem is formally posed as the task of partitioning the arms of an N-armed stochastic bandit according to their underlying distributions, grouping two arms together if and only if they share the same distribution, using samples collected sequentially and adaptively. This setting has gained attention in recent years due to its applicability in recommendation systems and crowdsourcing. Existing works on clustering with bandit feedback rely on a strong assumption that the underlying distributions are sub-Gaussian. As a consequence, the existing methods mainly cover settings with linearly-separable clusters, which has little practical relevance. We introduce a framework of ``nonparametric clustering with bandit feedback'', where the underlying arm distributions are not constrained to any parametric, and hence, it is applicable for active clustering of real-world datasets. We adopt a kernel-based approach, which allows us to reformulate the nonparametric problem as the task of clustering the arms according to their kernel mean embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Building on this formulation, we introduce the KABC algorithm with theoretical correctness guarantees and analyze its sampling budget. We introduce a notion of signal-to-noise ratio for this problem that depends on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between the arm distributions and on their variance in the RKHS. Our algorithm is adaptive to this unknown quantity: it does not require it as an input yet achieves instance-dependent guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recommendation-as-Experience: A framework for context-sensitive adaptation in conversational recommender systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07401v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) have matured technically, they frequently lack principled methods for encoding latent experiential aims as adaptive state variables. Consequently, contemporary architectures often prioritise ranking accuracy at the expense of nuanced, context-sensitive interaction behaviours. This paper addresses this gap through a comprehensive multi-domain study ($N = 168$) that quantifies the joint prioritisation of three critical interaction aims: educative (to inform and justify), explorative (to diversify and inspire), and affective (to align emotionally and socially). Utilising Bayesian hierarchical ordinal regression, we establish domain profiles and perceived item value as systematic modulators of these priorities. Furthermore, we identify stable user-level preferences for autonomy that persist across distinct interactional goals, suggesting that agency is a fundamental requirement of the conversational experience. Drawing on these empirical foundations, we formalise the Recommendation-as-Experience (RAE) adaptation framework. RAE systematically encodes contextual and individual signals into structured state representations, mapping them to experience-aligned dialogue policies realised through retrieval diversification, heuristic logic, or Large Language Model based controllable generation. As an architecture-agnostic blueprint, RAE facilitates the design of context-sensitive CRS that effectively balance experiential quality with predictive performance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face bottlenecks in constructing item identifiers. Text-based methods introduce LLMs' vast output space, leading to hallucination, while methods based on Semantic IDs (SIDs) encounter a semantic gap between SIDs and LLMs' native vocabulary, requiring costly vocabulary expansion and alignment training. To address this, this paper introduces Term IDs (TIDs), defined as a set of semantically rich and standardized textual keywords, to serve as robust item identifiers. We propose GRLM, a novel framework centered on TIDs, employs Context-aware Term Generation to convert item's metadata into standardized TIDs and utilizes Integrative Instruction Fine-tuning to collaboratively optimize term internalization and sequential recommendation. Additionally, Elastic Identifier Grounding is designed for robust item mapping. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GRLM significantly outperforms baselines across multiple scenarios, pointing a promising direction for generalizable and high-performance generative recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |

We first analyze planning-related job postings to revisit the evolving roles of planners in the era of AI. We then examine climate equity plans across the U.S. and apply ChatGPT to conduct semantic analysis, extracting policy, strategy, and action items related to transportation and energy. The methodological framework relied on a LangChain-native retrieval-augmented generation pipeline. Based on these extracted elements and their evaluated presence, we develop a content-based recommendation system to support cross-city policy comparison. The results indicate that, despite growing attention to AI, planning jobs largely retain their traditional domain emphases in transportation, environmental planning, housing, and land use. Communicative responsibilities remain central to planning practice. Climate equity plans commonly address transportation, environmental, and energy-related measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and predominantly employ affirmative language. The demonstration of the recommendation system illustrates how planners can efficiently identify cities with similar policy practices, revealing patterns of geographic similarity in policy adoption. The study concludes by envisioning localized yet personalized AI-assisted systems that can be adapted within urban systems.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Pragya, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for semantic recommendation of Subhasitas. We curate a dataset of 200 verses annotated with thematic tags such as motivation, friendship, and compassion. Using sentence embeddings (IndicBERT), the system retrieves top-k verses relevant to user queries. The retrieved results are then passed to a generative model (Mistral LLM) to produce transliterations, translations, and contextual explanations. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that semantic retrieval significantly outperforms keyword matching in precision and relevance, while user studies highlight improved accessibility through generated summaries. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating retrieval and generation for Sanskrit Subhasitas, bridging cultural heritage with modern applied AI.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[A Causal Information-Flow Framework for Unbiased Learning-to-Rank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05590v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In web search and recommendation systems, user clicks are widely used to train ranking models. However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation. Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show that our method consistently reduces measured bias leakage and improves ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases-such as position and trust bias-interact strongly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Macro Graph of Experts for Billion-Scale Multi-Task Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10520v4)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs. Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures, relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Experts (MGOE) framework, the first approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts. Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering multi-task learning for a leading billion-scale recommender system, Alibaba. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE in billion-scale recommender systems.</p></details> | Accepted to KDD2026 |
| **[Do LLMs Benefit from User and Item Embeddings in Recommendation Tasks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04690v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising recommendation systems, offering novel ways to model user preferences through generative approaches. However, many existing methods often rely solely on text semantics or incorporate collaborative signals in a limited manner, typically using only user or item embeddings. These methods struggle to handle multiple item embeddings representing user history, reverting to textual semantics and neglecting richer collaborative information. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective solution that projects user and item embeddings, learned from collaborative filtering, into the LLM token space via separate lightweight projector modules. A finetuned LLM then conditions on these projected embeddings alongside textual tokens to generate recommendations. Preliminary results show that this design effectively leverages structured user-item interaction data, improves recommendation performance over text-only LLM baselines, and offers a practical path for bridging traditional recommendation systems with modern LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Workshop at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods suffer from a critical issue we term Semantic Drift, where errors in early, high-level tokens irreversibly divert the generation trajectory into irrelevant semantic subspaces. Inspired by Process Reward Models (PRMs) that enhance reasoning in Large Language Models, we propose Promise, a novel framework that integrates dense, step-by-step verification into generative models. Promise features a lightweight PRM to assess the quality of intermediate inference steps, coupled with a PRM-guided Beam Search strategy that leverages dense feedback to dynamically prune erroneous branches. Crucially, our approach unlocks Test-Time Scaling Laws for recommender systems: by increasing inference compute, smaller models can match or surpass larger models. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests on a large-scale platform demonstrate that Promise effectively mitigates Semantic Drift, significantly improving recommendation accuracy while enabling efficient deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneVision: An End-to-End Generative Framework for Multi-view E-commerce Vision Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05759v4)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems, follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation. In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and +3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric, generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while simplifying the serving pathway.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Recommender System Evaluation: A Multi-Modal User Agent Framework for A/B Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04554v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recommender systems, online A/B testing is a crucial method for evaluating the performance of different models. However, conducting online A/B testing often presents significant challenges, including substantial economic costs, user experience degradation, and considerable time requirements. With the Large Language Models' powerful capacity, LLM-based agent shows great potential to replace traditional online A/B testing. Nonetheless, current agents fail to simulate the perception process and interaction patterns, due to the lack of real environments and visual perception capability. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-modal user agent for A/B testing (A/B Agent). Specifically, we construct a recommendation sandbox environment for A/B testing, enabling multimodal and multi-page interactions that align with real user behavior on online platforms. The designed agent leverages multimodal information perception, fine-grained user preferences, and integrates profiles, action memory retrieval, and a fatigue system to simulate complex human decision-making. We validated the potential of the agent as an alternative to traditional A/B testing from three perspectives: model, data, and features. Furthermore, we found that the data generated by A/B Agent can effectively enhance the capabilities of recommendation models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/ABAgent.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have shown that RecSys are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether user interaction record was used to train a target model or not. MIAs on RecSys models can directly lead to a privacy breach. For example, via identifying the fact that a purchase record that has been used to train a RecSys associated with a specific user, an attacker can infer that user's special quirks. In recent years, MIAs have been shown to be effective on other ML tasks, e.g., classification models and natural language processing. However, traditional MIAs are ill-suited for RecSys due to the unseen posterior probability. Although MIAs on RecSys form a newly emerging and rapidly growing research area, there has been no systematic survey on this topic yet. In this article, we conduct the first comprehensive survey on RecSys MIAs. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in RecSys MIAs, exploring the design principles, challenges, attack and defense associated with this emerging field. We provide a unified taxonomy that categorizes different RecSys MIAs based on their characterizations and discuss their pros and cons. Based on the limitations and gaps identified in this survey, we point out several promising future research directions to inspire the researchers who wish to follow this area. This survey not only serves as a reference for the research community but also provides a clear description for researchers outside this research domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review in ACM Survey</p></details> |

A query specifies an admissible subset -- called a slate -- and the model chooses one item from that slate with probability proportional to its weight. This query model is also known as the Plackett-Luce model or conditional sampling oracle in the literature. Although MNLs have been studied extensively, a basic computational question remains open: given query access to slates, how efficiently can we learn weights so that, for every slate, the induced choice distribution is within total variation distance $\varepsilon$ of the ground truth? This question is central to MNL learning and has direct implications for modern recommender system interfaces. We provide two algorithms for this task, one with adaptive queries and one with non-adaptive queries. Each algorithm outputs an MNL $M'$ that induces, for each slate $S$, a distribution $M'_S$ on $S$ that is within $\varepsilon$ total variation distance of the true distribution. Our adaptive algorithm makes $O\left(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^{3}}\log n\right)$ queries, while our non-adaptive algorithm makes $O\left(\frac{n^{2}}{\varepsilon^{3}}\log n \log\frac{n}{\varepsilon}\right)$ queries. Both algorithms query only slates of size two and run in time proportional to their query complexity. We complement these upper bounds with lower bounds of $Ω\left(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^{2}}\log n\right)$ for adaptive queries and $Ω\left(\frac{n^{2}}{\varepsilon^{2}}\log n\right)$ for non-adaptive queries, thus proving that our adaptive algorithm is optimal in its dependence on the support size $n$, while the non-adaptive one is tight within a $\log n$ factor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Integrated Transformers for Community Detection in Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04367v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Community detection is crucial for applications like targeted marketing and recommendation systems. Traditional methods rely on network structure, and embedding-based models integrate semantic information. However, there is a challenge when a model leverages local and global information from complex structures like social networks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers have shown superior performance in capturing local and global relationships. In this paper, We propose Graph Integrated Transformer for Community Detection (GIT-CD), a hybrid model combining GNNs and Transformer-based attention mechanisms to enhance community detection in social networks. Specifically, the GNN module captures local graph structures, while the Transformer module models long-range dependencies. A self-optimizing clustering module refines community assignments using K-Means, silhouette loss, and KL divergence minimization. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that GIT-CD outperforms state-of-the-art models, making it a robust approach for detecting meaningful communities in complex social networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at IEEE GLOBECOM 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce a transparent recommender system that uses fuzzy neural networks to learn human-readable rules from behavioral data for predicting article clicks. By extracting the rules at configurable thresholds, we can control rule complexity and thus, the level of interpretability. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available news datasets (i.e., MIND and EB-NeRD) and show that we can accurately predict click behavior compared to several established baselines, while learning human-readable rules. Furthermore, we show that the learned rules reveal news consumption patterns, enabling editors to align content curation goals with target audience behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the IR for Good track at ECIR'26</p></details> |

However, this setting is fraught with the persistent challenge of false negatives, where unobserved user-item interactions are not necessarily indicative of negative preference. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel and principled loss function, named Corrected and Weighted (CW) loss, that systematically corrects for the impact of false negatives within the training objective. Our approach integrates two key techniques. First, inspired by Positive-Unlabeled learning, we debias the negative sampling process by re-calibrating the assumed negative distribution. By theoretically approximating the true negative distribution (p-) using the observable general data distribution (p) and the positive interaction distribution (p^+), our method provides a more accurate estimate of the likelihood that a sampled unlabeled item is truly negative. Second, we introduce a dynamic re-weighting mechanism that modulates the importance of each negative instance based on the model's current prediction. This scheme encourages the model to enforce a larger ranking margin between positive items and confidently predicted (i.e., easy) negative items, while simultaneously down-weighting the penalty on uncertain negatives that have a higher probability of being false negatives. A key advantage of our approach is its elegance and efficiency; it requires no complex modifications to the data sampling process or significant computational overhead, making it readily applicable to a wide array of existing recommendation models. Extensive experiments conducted on four large-scale, sparse benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed loss. The results show that our method consistently and significantly outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art loss functions across multiple ranking-oriented metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2508.05673 by other authors</p></details> |

We leverage a new capability on emerging decentralized social media platforms: the ability for anyone to build and deploy feeds for other users, to use just as they would a native platform-built feed. To our knowledge, Paper Skygest is the first and largest such continuously deployed personalized social media feed by academics, with over 50,000 weekly uses by over 1,000 daily active users, all organically acquired.

Second, we share our full code and describe our system architecture, to support other academics in building and deploying such feeds sustainably. Third, we overview the potential of custom feeds such as Paper Skygest for studying algorithm designs, building for user agency, and running recommender system experiments with organic users without partnering with a centralized platform.</p></details> |  |

While extended user-engagement histories can improve the prediction of user interests, it is equally important to embed activity sequences from multiple sources to ensure freshness of user and ad-representations, following scaling law principles. In this paper, we present a novel three-dimensional framework for enhancing user-ad representations without increasing model inference or serving complexity. The first dimension examines the impact of incorporating diverse event sources, the second considers the benefits of longer user histories, and the third focuses on enriching data with additional event attributes and multi-modal embeddings. We assess the return on investment (ROI) of our source enrichment framework by comparing organic user engagement sources, such as content viewing, with ad-impression sources. The proposed method can boost the area under curve (AUC) and the slope of scaling curves for ad-impression sources by 1.56 to 2 times compared to organic usage sources even for short online-sequence lengths of 100 to 10K. Additionally, click-through rate (CTR) prediction improves by 0.56% AUC over the baseline production ad-recommendation system when using enriched ad-impression event sources, leading to improved sequence scaling resolutions for longer and offline user-ad representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Graph-Structured Driven Dual Adaptation for Mitigating Popularity Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23358v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popularity bias is a common challenge in recommender systems. It often causes unbalanced item recommendation performance and intensifies the Matthew effect. Due to limited user-item interactions, unpopular items are frequently constrained to the embedding neighborhoods of only a few users, leading to representation collapse and weakening the model's generalization. Although existing supervised alignment and reweighting methods can help mitigate this problem, they still face two major limitations: (1) they overlook the inherent variability among different Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) layers, which can result in negative gains in deeper layers; (2) they rely heavily on fixed hyperparameters to balance popular and unpopular items, limiting adaptability to diverse data distributions and increasing model complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-Structured Dual Adaptation Framework (GSDA), a dual adaptive framework for mitigating popularity bias in recommendation. Our theoretical analysis shows that supervised alignment in GCNs is hindered by the over-smoothing effect, where the distinction between popular and unpopular items diminishes as layers deepen, reducing the effectiveness of alignment at deeper levels. To overcome this limitation, GSDA integrates a hierarchical adaptive alignment mechanism that counteracts entropy decay across layers together with a distribution-aware contrastive weighting strategy based on the Gini coefficient, enabling the model to adapt its debiasing strength dynamically without relying on fixed hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GSDA effectively alleviates popularity bias while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods in recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |

A fundamental challenge in deploying sophisticated ML models for sequential decision-making is the lack of tractable concentration inequalities required for principled exploration. We overcome this limitation by directly modeling the learning curve behavior of the underlying estimator. Specifically, assuming the Mean Squared Error decreases as a power law in the number of training samples, we derive a generalized concentration inequality and prove that ML-UCB achieves sublinear regret. This framework enables the principled integration of any ML model whose learning curve can be empirically characterized, eliminating the need for model-specific theoretical analysis. We validate our approach through experiments on a collaborative filtering recommendation system using online matrix factorization with synthetic data designed to simulate a simplified two-tower model, demonstrating substantial improvements over LinUCB</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, Multi-Arm bandit, psi-UCB, generalized estimators</p></details> |

However, they are trained on vast corpora whose contents are not publicly disclosed, raising concerns about data leakage. Recent work has shown that the MovieLens-1M dataset is memorized by both the LLaMA and OpenAI model families, but the extraction of such memorized data has so far relied exclusively on manual prompt engineering. In this paper, we pose three main questions: Is it possible to enhance manual prompting? Can LLM memorization be detected through methods beyond manual prompting? And can the detection of data leakage be automated? To address these questions, we evaluate three approaches: (i) jailbreak prompt engineering; (ii) unsupervised latent knowledge discovery, probing internal activations via Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) and Cluster-Norm; and (iii) Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE), which frames prompt discovery as a meta-learning process that iteratively refines candidate instructions. Experiments on MovieLens-1M using LLaMA models show that jailbreak prompting does not improve the retrieval of memorized items and remains inconsistent; CCS reliably distinguishes genuine from fabricated movie titles but fails on numerical user and rating data; and APE retrieves item-level information with moderate success yet struggles to recover numerical interactions. These findings suggest that automatically optimizing prompts is the most promising strategy for extracting memorized samples.</p></details> |  |

Given these successes, the Recommender Systems (RSs) community has begun investigating its applications within recommendation scenarios primarily focusing on accuracy. While the integration of ChatGPT into RSs has garnered significant attention, a comprehensive analysis of its performance across various dimensions remains largely unexplored. Specifically, the capabilities of providing diverse and novel recommendations or exploring potential biases such as popularity bias have not been thoroughly examined. As the use of these models continues to expand, understanding these aspects is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and achieving long-term personalization. This study investigates the recommendations provided by ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 by assessing ChatGPT's capabilities in terms of diversity, novelty, and popularity bias. We evaluate these models on three distinct datasets and assess their performance in Top-N recommendation and cold-start scenarios. The findings reveal that ChatGPT-4 matches or surpasses traditional recommenders, demonstrating the ability to balance novelty and diversity in recommendations. Furthermore, in the cold-start scenario, ChatGPT models exhibit superior performance in both accuracy and novelty, suggesting they can be particularly beneficial for new users. This research highlights the strengths and limitations of ChatGPT's recommendations, offering new perspectives on the capacity of these models to provide recommendations beyond accuracy-focused metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mem-Rec: Memory Efficient Recommendation System using Alternative Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07205v3)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based recommendation systems (e.g., DLRMs) are widely used AI models to provide high-quality personalized recommendations. Training data used for modern recommendation systems commonly includes categorical features taking on tens-of-millions of possible distinct values. These categorical tokens are typically assigned learned vector representations, that are stored in large embedding tables, on the order of 100s of GB. Storing and accessing these tables represent a substantial burden in commercial deployments. Our work proposes MEM-REC, a novel alternative representation approach for embedding tables. MEM-REC leverages bloom filters and hashing methods to encode categorical features using two cache-friendly embedding tables. The first table (token embedding) contains raw embeddings (i.e. learned vector representation), and the second table (weight embedding), which is much smaller, contains weights to scale these raw embeddings to provide better discriminative capability to each data point. We provide a detailed architecture, design and analysis of MEM-REC addressing trade-offs in accuracy and computation requirements, in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques. We show that MEM-REC can not only maintain the recommendation quality and significantly reduce the memory footprint for commercial scale recommendation models but can also improve the embedding latency. In particular, based on our results, MEM-REC compresses the MLPerf CriteoTB benchmark DLRM model size by 2900x and performs up to 3.4x faster embeddings while achieving the same AUC as that of the full uncompressed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[MergeRec: Model Merging for Data-Isolated Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01753v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern recommender systems trained on domain-specific data often struggle to generalize across multiple domains. Cross-domain sequential recommendation has emerged as a promising research direction to address this challenge; however, existing approaches face fundamental limitations, such as reliance on overlapping users or items across domains, or unrealistic assumptions that ignore privacy constraints. In this work, we propose a new framework, MergeRec, based on model merging under a new and realistic problem setting termed data-isolated cross-domain sequential recommendation, where raw user interaction data cannot be shared across domains. MergeRec consists of three key components: (1) merging initialization, (2) pseudo-user data construction, and (3) collaborative merging optimization. First, we initialize a merged model using training-free merging techniques. Next, we construct pseudo-user data by treating each item as a virtual sequence in each domain, enabling the synthesis of meaningful training samples without relying on real user interactions. Finally, we optimize domain-specific merging weights through a joint objective that combines a recommendation loss, which encourages the merged model to identify relevant items, and a distillation loss, which transfers collaborative filtering signals from the fine-tuned source models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MergeRec not only preserves the strengths of the original models but also significantly enhances generalizability to unseen domains. Compared to conventional model merging methods, MergeRec consistently achieves superior performance, with average improvements of up to 17.21% in Recall@10, highlighting the potential of model merging as a scalable and effective approach for building universal recommender systems.

| **[RelayGR: Scaling Long-Sequence Generative Recommendation via Cross-Stage Relay-Race Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01712v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time recommender systems execute multi-stage cascades (retrieval, pre-processing, fine-grained ranking) under strict tail-latency SLOs, leaving only tens of milliseconds for ranking. Generative recommendation (GR) models can improve quality by consuming long user-behavior sequences, but in production their online sequence length is tightly capped by the ranking-stage P99 budget. We observe that the majority of GR tokens encode user behaviors that are independent of the item candidates, suggesting an opportunity to pre-infer a user-behavior prefix once and reuse it during ranking rather than recomputing it on the critical path. Realizing this idea at industrial scale is non-trivial: the prefix cache must survive across multiple pipeline stages before the final ranking instance is determined, the user population implies cache footprints far beyond a single device, and indiscriminate pre-inference would overload shared resources under high QPS. We present RelayGR, a production system that enables in-HBM relay-race inference for GR. RelayGR selectively pre-infers long-term user prefixes, keeps their KV caches resident in HBM over the request lifecycle, and ensures the subsequent ranking can consume them without remote fetches. RelayGR combines three techniques: 1) a sequence-aware trigger that admits only at-risk requests under a bounded cache footprint and pre-inference load, 2) an affinity-aware router that co-locates cache production and consumption by routing both the auxiliary pre-infer signal and the ranking request to the same instance, and 3) a memory-aware expander that uses server-local DRAM to capture short-term cross-request reuse while avoiding redundant reloads. We implement RelayGR on Huawei Ascend NPUs and evaluate it with real queries. Under a fixed P99 SLO, RelayGR supports up to 1.5$\times$ longer sequences and improves SLO-compliant throughput by up to 3.6$\times$.</p></details> |  |

Elections have been the canonical way by which modern democracy has operated since the 17th century. Nowadays, they regulate markets, provide an engine for modern recommender systems or peer-to-peer networks, and remain the main approach to represent democracy. However, a desirable universal voting rule that satisfies all hypothetical scenarios is still a challenging topic, and the design of these systems is at the forefront of mechanism design research. Automated mechanism design is a promising approach, and recent works have demonstrated that set-invariant architectures are uniquely suited to modelling electoral systems. However, various concerns prevent the direct application to real-world settings, such as robustness to strategic voting. In this paper, we generalise the expressive capability of learned voting rules, and combine improvements in neural network architecture with adversarial training to improve the resilience of voting rules while maximizing social welfare. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our method resolves critical limitations of prior work regarding learning voting rules by representing elections using bipartite graphs, and learning such voting rules using graph neural networks. We believe this opens new frontiers for applying machine learning to real-world elections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Diffusion-based Augmentation for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01448v1)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems often rely on implicit feedback, where only positive user-item interactions can be observed. Negative sampling is therefore crucial to provide proper negative training signals. However, existing methods tend to mislabel potentially positive but unobserved items as negatives and lack precise control over negative sample selection. We aim to address these by generating controllable negative samples, rather than sampling from the existing item pool. In this context, we propose Adaptive Diffusion-based Augmentation for Recommendation (ADAR), a novel and model-agnostic module that leverages diffusion to synthesize informative negatives. Inspired by the progressive corruption process in diffusion, ADAR simulates a continuous transition from positive to negative, allowing for fine-grained control over sample hardness. To mine suitable negative samples, we theoretically identify the transition point at which a positive sample turns negative and derive a score-aware function to adaptively determine the optimal sampling timestep. By identifying this transition point, ADAR generates challenging negative samples that effectively refine the model's decision boundary. Experiments confirm that ADAR is broadly compatible and boosts the performance of existing recommendation models substantially, including collaborative filtering and sequential recommendation, without architectural modifications.</p></details> |  |

These systems leverage user preferences to provide personalized recommendations, thereby helping users navigate through the paradox of choice. This work focuses on personalized sequential recommendation, where the system considers not only a user's immediate, evolving session context, but also their cumulative historical behavior to provide highly relevant and timely recommendations. Through an empirical study conducted on diverse real-world datasets, we have observed and quantified the existence and impact of both short-term (immediate and transient) and long-term (enduring and stable) preferences on users' historical interactions. Building on these insights, we propose a framework that combines short- and long-term preferences to enhance recommendation performance, namely Compositions of Variant Experts (CoVE). This novel framework dynamically integrates short- and long-term preferences through the use of different specialized recommendation models (i.e., experts). Extensive experiments showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methods and ablation studies further investigate the impact of variant expert types.</p></details> |  |

Despite this progress, efficiently promoting dataset sharing and utilization for scientific research remains challenging. Scientific datasets contain intricate domain-specific knowledge and contexts, rendering traditional collaborative filtering-based recommenders inadequate. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to build conversational agents capable of deep semantic understanding and personalized recommendations. In response, we present ScienceDB AI, a novel LLM-driven agentic recommender system developed on Science Data Bank (ScienceDB), one of the largest global scientific data-sharing platforms. ScienceDB AI leverages natural language conversations and deep reasoning to accurately recommend datasets aligned with researchers' scientific intents and evolving requirements. The system introduces several innovations: a Scientific Intention Perceptor to extract structured experimental elements from complicated queries, a Structured Memory Compressor to manage multi-turn dialogues effectively, and a Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Trustworthy RAG) framework. The Trustworthy RAG employs a two-stage retrieval mechanism and provides citable dataset references via Citable Scientific Task Record (CSTR) identifiers, enhancing recommendation trustworthiness and reproducibility. Through extensive offline and online experiments using over 10 million real-world datasets, ScienceDB AI has demonstrated significant effectiveness. To our knowledge, ScienceDB AI is the first LLM-driven conversational recommender tailored explicitly for large-scale scientific dataset sharing services. The platform is publicly accessible at: https://ai.scidb.cn/en.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Creators, in turn, adapt their content to align with users preferences and enhance their popularity. At the same time, users preferences evolve under the influence of both suggested content from the recommender system and content shared within their social circles. This feedback loop generates a complex interplay between users, creators, and recommender algorithms, which is the key cause of filter bubbles and opinion polarization. We develop a social network-aware recommender system that explicitly accounts for this user-creators feedback interaction and strategically exploits the topology of the user's own social network to promote diversification. Our approach highlights how accounting for and exploiting user's social network in the recommender system design is crucial to mediate filter bubble effects while balancing content diversity with personalization. Provably, opinion clusterization is positively correlated with the influence of recommended content on user opinions. Ultimately, the proposed approach shows the power of socially-aware recommender systems in combating opinion polarization and clusterization phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[AlignUSER: Human-Aligned LLM Agents via World Models for Recommender System Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00930v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating recommender systems remains challenging due to the gap between offline metrics and real user behavior, as well as the scarcity of interaction data. Recent work explores large language model (LLM) agents as synthetic users, yet they typically rely on few-shot prompting, which yields a shallow understanding of the environment and limits their ability to faithfully reproduce user actions. We introduce AlignUSER, a framework that learns world-model-driven agents from human interactions. Given rollout sequences of actions and states, we formalize world modeling as a next state prediction task that helps the agent internalize the environment. To align actions with human personas, we generate counterfactual trajectories around demonstrations and prompt the LLM to compare its decisions with human choices, identify suboptimal actions, and extract lessons. The learned policy is then used to drive agent interactions with the recommender system. We evaluate AlignUSER across multiple datasets and demonstrate closer alignment with genuine humans than prior work, both at the micro and macro levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[OxygenREC: An Instruction-Following Generative Framework for E-commerce Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22386v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommendation systems suffer from inconsistency in multi-stage optimization objectives. Generative Recommendation (GR) mitigates them through an end-to-end framework; however, existing methods still rely on matching mechanisms based on inductive patterns. Although responsive, they lack the ability to uncover complex user intents that require deductive reasoning based on world knowledge. Meanwhile, LLMs show strong deep reasoning capabilities, but their latency and computational costs remain challenging for industrial applications. More critically, there are performance bottlenecks in multi-scenario scalability: as shown in Figure 1, existing solutions require independent training and deployment for each scenario, leading to low resource utilization and high maintenance costs-a challenge unaddressed in GR literature. To address these, we present OxygenREC, an industrial recommendation system that leverages Fast-Slow Thinking to deliver deep reasoning with strict latency and multi-scenario requirements of real-world environments. First, we adopt a Fast-Slow Thinking architecture. Slow thinking uses a near-line LLM pipeline to synthesize Contextual Reasoning Instructions, while fast thinking employs a high-efficiency encoder-decoder backbone for real-time generation. Second, to ensure reasoning instructions effectively enhance recommendation generation, we introduce a semantic alignment mechanism with Instruction-Guided Retrieval (IGR) to filter intent-relevant historical behaviors and use a Query-to-Item (Q2I) loss for instruction-item consistency. Finally, to resolve multi-scenario scalability, we transform scenario information into controllable instructions, using unified reward mapping and Soft Adaptive Group Clip Policy Optimization (SA-GCPO) to align policies with diverse business objectives, realizing a train-once-deploy-everywhere paradigm.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |
| **[OpenOneRec Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24762v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the OneRec series has successfully unified the fragmented recommendation pipeline into an end-to-end generative framework, a significant gap remains between recommendation systems and general intelligence. Constrained by isolated data, they operate as domain specialists-proficient in pattern matching but lacking world knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and instruction following. This limitation is further compounded by the lack of a holistic benchmark to evaluate such integrated capabilities. To address this, our contributions are: 1) RecIF Bench & Open Data: We propose RecIF-Bench, a holistic benchmark covering 8 diverse tasks that thoroughly evaluate capabilities from fundamental prediction to complex reasoning. Concurrently, we release a massive training dataset comprising 96 million interactions from 160,000 users to facilitate reproducible research. 2) Framework & Scaling: To ensure full reproducibility, we open-source our comprehensive training pipeline, encompassing data processing, co-pretraining, and post-training. Leveraging this framework, we demonstrate that recommendation capabilities can scale predictably while mitigating catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge. 3) OneRec-Foundation: We release OneRec Foundation (1.7B and 8B), a family of models establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across all tasks in RecIF-Bench. Furthermore, when transferred to the Amazon benchmark, our models surpass the strongest baselines with an average 26.8% improvement in Recall@10 across 10 diverse datasets (Figure 1). This work marks a step towards building truly intelligent recommender systems. Nonetheless, realizing this vision presents significant technical and theoretical challenges, highlighting the need for broader research engagement in this promising direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reveal Hidden Pitfalls and Navigate Next Generation of Vector Similarity Search from Task-Centric Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12980v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector Similarity Search (VSS) in high-dimensional spaces is rapidly emerging as core functionality in next-generation database systems for numerous data-intensive services -- from embedding lookups in large language models (LLMs), to semantic information retrieval and recommendation engines. Current benchmarks, however, evaluate VSS primarily on the recall-latency trade-off against a ground truth defined solely by distance metrics, neglecting how retrieval quality ultimately impacts downstream tasks. This disconnect can mislead both academic research and industrial practice. We present Iceberg, a holistic benchmark suite for end-to-end evaluation of VSS methods in realistic application contexts. From a task-centric view, Iceberg uncovers the Information Loss Funnel, which identifies three principal sources of end-to-end performance degradation: (1) Embedding Loss during feature extraction; (2) Metric Misuse, where distances poorly reflect task relevance; (3) Data Distribution Sensitivity, highlighting index robustness across skews and modalities. For a more comprehensive assessment, Iceberg spans eight diverse datasets across key domains such as image classification, face recognition, text retrieval, and recommendation systems. Each dataset, ranging from 1M to 100M vectors, includes rich, task-specific labels and evaluation metrics, enabling assessment of retrieval algorithms within the full application pipeline rather than in isolation. Iceberg benchmarks 13 state-of-the-art VSS methods and re-ranks them based on application-level metrics, revealing substantial deviations from traditional rankings derived purely from recall-latency evaluations. Building on these insights, we define a set of task-centric meta-features and derive an interpretable decision tree to guide practitioners in selecting and tuning VSS methods for their specific workloads.</p></details> | SIGMOD2026 |

We ask whether homepage exposure changes who join r/conspiracy, how long they stay, and how they adapt linguistically, compared with users who arrive through organic discovery. Using a computational framework that combines toxicity scores, survival analysis, and lexical and semantic measures, the study shows that homepage visibility acts as a selection mechanism rather than a simple amplifier. Users who discover the community organically integrate more quickly into its linguistic and thematic norms and show more stable engagement over time. By contrast, users who arrive through visibility on the homepage remain semantically distant from core discourse and participate more briefly. Overall, algorithmic visibility reshapes audience size, community composition, and linguistic cohesion: newcomers who do not join organically have different incentives, integrate weakly, and leave quickly, which limits organic growth. In this high-risk setting, the observed behavioral and linguistic trajectories over five months do not match standard narratives in which incidental exposure to conspiracy content produces durable radicalization. These findings can inform the design of web platforms and recommendation systems that seek to curb harmful conspiracy exposure while supporting more responsible, transparent, and socially beneficial uses of algorithmic recommendations.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present Convexified Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks (CGNNs), a novel and general framework that combines the power of message-passing GNNs with the tractability of convex optimization. By mapping their nonlinear filters into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, CGNNs transform training into a convex optimization problem, which projected gradient methods can solve both efficiently and optimally. Convexity further allows CGNNs' statistical properties to be analyzed accurately and rigorously. For two-layer CGNNs, we establish rigorous generalization guarantees, showing convergence to the performance of an optimal GNN. To scale to deeper architectures, we adopt a principled layer-wise training strategy. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CGNNs significantly exceed the performance of leading GNN models, obtaining 10-40% higher accuracy in most cases, underscoring their promise as a powerful and principled method with strong theoretical foundations. In rare cases where improvements are not quantitatively substantial, the convex models either slightly exceed or match the baselines, stressing their robustness and wide applicability. Though over-parameterization is often used to enhance performance in non-convex models, we show that our CGNNs yield shallow convex models that can surpass non-convex ones in accuracy and model compactness.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in 29th Annual Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), 2026</p></details> |

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a powerful reasoning engine for this task but struggle to natively process these heterogeneous, non-textual data types. To address this, we propose UniPACT (Unified Prognostic Question Answering for Clinical Time-series), a unified framework for prognostic question answering that bridges this modality gap. UniPACT's core contribution is a structured prompting mechanism that converts numerical EHR data into semantically rich text. This textualized patient context is then fused with representations learned directly from raw ECG waveforms, enabling an LLM to reason over both modalities holistically. We evaluate UniPACT on the comprehensive MDS-ED benchmark, it achieves a state-of-the-art mean AUROC of 89.37% across a diverse set of prognostic tasks including diagnosis, deterioration, ICU admission, and mortality, outperforming specialized baselines. Further analysis demonstrates that our multimodal, multi-task approach is critical for performance and provides robustness in missing data scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Trajectory Representation Learning for Travel Time Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05840v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, traditional approaches typically convert trajectory data into fixed-length representations. This overlooks the inherent variability of real-world motion patterns, often resulting in information loss and redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance the performance of TTE. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a multimodal fusion module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics, while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/City-Computing/MDTI.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deepfake attribution (DFA) works primarily focus on the interaction among various domains in vision modality, and other modalities such as texts and face parsing are not fully explored. Besides, they tend to fail to assess the generalization performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion in a fine-grained manner. In this paper, we propose a novel parsing-aware vision language model with a dynamic contrastive learning (PVLM) method for zero-shot deepfake attribution (ZSDFA), which facilitates effective and fine-grained traceability to unseen advanced generators. Specifically, we conduct a novel and fine-grained ZS-DFA benchmark to evaluate the attribution performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion. Besides, we propose an innovative PVLM attributor based on the vision-language model to capture general and diverse attribution features. We are motivated by the observation that the preservation of source face attributes in facial images generated by GAN and diffusion models varies significantly. We propose to employ the inherent facial attributes preservation differences to capture face parsing-aware forgery representations. Therefore, we devise a novel parsing encoder to focus on global face attribute embeddings, enabling parsing-guided DFA representation learning via dynamic vision-parsing matching. Additionally, we present a novel deepfake attribution contrastive center loss to pull relevant generators closer and push irrelevant ones away, which can be introduced into DFA models to enhance traceability. Experimental results show that our model exceeds the state-of-the-art on the ZS-DFA benchmark via various protocol evaluations.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often fail to fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI).

When these systems fail, the problem is often not the language model itself, but that the nearest neighbors in the embedding space correspond to the wrong cases. Modern machine learning systems increasingly rely on fixed, high-dimensional embeddings produced by large pretrained models and sentence encoders. In real-world deployments, labels are scarce, domains shift over time, and retraining the base encoder is expensive or infeasible. As a result, downstream performance depends heavily on embedding geometry. Yet raw embeddings are often poorly aligned with the local neighborhood structure required by nearest-neighbor retrieval, similarity search, and lightweight classifiers that operate directly on embeddings. We propose PEARL (Prototype-Enhanced Aligned Representation Learning), a label-efficient approach that uses limited supervision to softly align embeddings toward class prototypes. The method reshapes local neighborhood geometry while preserving dimensionality and avoiding aggressive projection or collapse. Its aim is to bridge the gap between purely unsupervised post-processing, which offers limited and inconsistent gains, and fully supervised projections that require substantial labeled data. We evaluate PEARL under controlled label regimes ranging from extreme label scarcity to higher-label settings. In the label-scarce condition, PEARL substantially improves local neighborhood quality, yielding 25.7% gains over raw embeddings and more than 21.1% gains relative to strong unsupervised post-processing, precisely in the regime where similarity-based systems are most brittle.</p></details> | 15 pages, 1 figure |
| **[MLLMRec: A Preference Reasoning Paradigm with Graph Refinement for Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15304v2)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation combines the user historical behaviors with the modal features of items to capture the tangible user preferences, presenting superior performance compared to the conventional ID-based recommender systems. However, existing methods still encounter two key problems in the representation learning of users and items, respectively: (1) the initialization of multimodal user representations is either agnostic to historical behaviors or contaminated by irrelevant modal noise, and (2) the widely used KNN-based item-item graph contains noisy edges with low similarities and lacks audience co-occurrence relationships. To address such issues, we propose MLLMRec, a novel preference reasoning paradigm with graph refinement for multimodal recommendation. Specifically, on the one hand, the item images are first converted into high-quality semantic descriptions using a multimodal large language model (MLLM), thereby bridging the semantic gap between visual and textual modalities. Then, we construct a behavioral description list for each user and feed it into the MLLM to reason about the purified user preference profiles that contain the latent interaction intents. On the other hand, we develop the threshold-controlled denoising and topology-aware enhancement strategies to refine the suboptimal item-item graph, thereby improving the accuracy of item representation learning. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that MLLMRec achieves the state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of 21.48% over the optimal baselines.

We directly evaluate it in a fully tabular predator-prey gridworld by comparing independent and centralized Q-learning under explicit embodiment constraints on agent speed and stamina. Across multiple kinematic regimes and asymmetric agent roles, centralized learning fails to provide a consistent advantage and is frequently outperformed by fully independent learning, even under full observability and exact value estimation. Moreover, asymmetric centralized-independent configurations induce persistent coordination breakdowns rather than transient learning instability. By eliminating confounding effects from function approximation and representation learning, our tabular analysis isolates coordination structure as the primary driver of these effects. The results show that increased coordination can become a liability under embodiment constraints, and that the effectiveness of centralized learning is fundamentally regime and role dependent rather than universal.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Perspectival Biases in Cross-Modal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26861v3)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval systems are expected to operate in a semantic space, agnostic to the language or cultural origin of the query. In practice, however, retrieval outcomes systematically reflect perspectival biases: deviations shaped by linguistic prevalence and cultural associations. We introduce the Cross-Cultural, Cross-Modal, Cross-lingual Multimodal (3XCM) benchmark to isolate these effects. Results from our studies indicate that, for image-to-text retrieval, models tend to favor entries from prevalent languages over those that are semantically faithful. For text-to-image retrieval, we observe a consistent "tugging effect" in the joint embedding space between semantic alignment and language-conditioned cultural association. When semantic representations are insufficiently resolved, particularly in low-resource languages, similarity is increasingly governed by culturally familiar visual patterns, leading to systematic association bias in retrieval. Our findings suggest that achieving equitable multimodal retrieval necessitates targeted strategies that explicitly decouple language from culture, rather than relying solely on broader data exposure. This work highlights the need to treat linguistic and cultural biases as distinct, measurable challenges in multimodal representation learning.</p></details> |  |

We propose a two-stage training framework combining contrastive learning and conditional decoding to enable flexible style control. The first stage aligns code style representations with semantic and structural features. In the second stage, we fine-tune a language model (e.g., Flan-T5) conditioned on the learned style vector to guide generation. Our method supports style interpolation and user personalization via lightweight mixing. Compared to prior work, our unified framework offers improved stylistic control without sacrificing code correctness. This is among the first approaches to combine contrastive alignment with conditional decoding for style-guided code generation.</p></details> |  |

In this regime, classical energy-based diagnostics and unconstrained learned representations are structurally insensitive, leading to delayed or unstable detection. We introduce GO-OSC, a geometry-aware representation learning framework for oscillatory time series that enforces a canonical and identifiable latent parameterization, enabling stable comparison and aggregation across short, unlabeled windows. Building on this representation, we define a family of invariant linear geometric probes that target degradation-relevant directions in latent space. We provide theoretical results showing that under early phase-only degradation, energy-based statistics have zero first-order detection power, whereas geometric probes achieve strictly positive sensitivity. Our analysis characterizes when and why linear probing fails under non-identifiable representations and shows how canonicalization restores statistical detectability. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real vibration datasets validate the theory, demonstrating earlier detection, improved data efficiency, and robustness to operating condition changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures.

Existing spatiotemporal multi-view representation learning (SMVRL) methods for event-based object recognition (EOR) offer promising solutions by projecting H-W-T events along spatial axis H and W, yet are limited by its translation-variant spatial binning representation and naive early concatenation fusion architecture. This paper reexamines the key SMVRL design stages for EAR and propose: (i) a principled spatiotemporal multi-view representation through translation-invariant dense conversion of sparse events, (ii) a dual-branch, dynamic fusion architecture that models sample-wise complementarity between motion features from different views, and (iii) a bio-inspired temporal warping augmentation that mimics speed variability of real-world human actions. On three challenging EAR datasets of HARDVS, DailyDVS-200 and THU-EACT-50-CHL, we show +7.0%, +10.7%, and +10.2% Top-1 accuracy gains over existing SMVRL EOR method with surprising 30.1% reduced parameters and 35.7% lower computations, establishing our framework as a novel and powerful EAR paradigm.</p></details> |  |

Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding.Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups,achieving superior segmentation transfer and strong downstream performance on clinically relevant tasks such as LVEF prediction.

While the continuous influx of new, unlabeled audio presents an opportunity to enrich these static representations, a naive approach is to retrain the model from scratch using all available data. However, this method is computationally prohibitive and discards the valuable knowledge embedded in the previously trained model weights. To address this inefficiency, we propose SONAR (Self-distilled cONtinual pre-training for domain adaptive Audio Representation), a continual pre-training framework built upon BEATs. SONAR effectively adapts to new domains while mitigating catastrophic forgetting by tackling three key challenges: implementing a joint sampling strategy for new and prior data, applying regularization to balance specificity and generality, and dynamically expanding the tokenizer codebook for novel acoustic patterns. Experiments across four distinct domains demonstrate that our method achieves both high adaptability and robust resistance to forgetting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others. In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[VOCAL: Visual Odometry via ContrAstive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00243v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Breakthroughs in visual odometry (VO) have fundamentally reshaped the landscape of robotics, enabling ultra-precise camera state estimation that is crucial for modern autonomous systems. Despite these advances, many learning-based VO techniques rely on rigid geometric assumptions, which often fall short in interpretability and lack a solid theoretical basis within fully data-driven frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VOCAL (Visual Odometry via ContrAstive Learning), a novel framework that reimagines VO as a label ranking challenge. By integrating Bayesian inference with a representation learning framework, VOCAL organizes visual features to mirror camera states. The ranking mechanism compels similar camera states to converge into consistent and spatially coherent representations within the latent space. This strategic alignment not only bolsters the interpretability of the learned features but also ensures compatibility with multimodal data sources. Extensive evaluations on the KITTI dataset highlight VOCAL's enhanced interpretability and flexibility, pushing VO toward more general and explainable spatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[Training-Free Geospatial Place Representation Learning from Large-Scale Point-of-Interest Graph Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02921v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning effective representations of urban environments requires capturing spatial structure beyond fixed administrative boundaries. Existing geospatial representation learning approaches typically aggregate Points of Interest(POI) into pre-defined administrative regions such as census units or ZIP code areas, assigning a single embedding to each region. However, POIs often form semantically meaningful groups that extend across, within, or beyond these boundaries, defining places that better reflect human activity and urban function. To address this limitation, we propose PlaceRep, a training-free geospatial representation learning method that constructs place-level representations by clustering spatially and semantically related POIs. PlaceRep summarizes large-scale POI graphs from U.S. Foursquare data to produce general-purpose urban region embeddings while automatically identifying places across multiple spatial scales. By eliminating model pre-training, PlaceRep provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-granular geospatial analysis. Experiments using the tasks of population density estimation and housing price prediction as downstream tasks show that PlaceRep outperforms most state-of-the-art graph-based geospatial representation learning methods and achieves up to a 100x speedup in generating region-level representations on large-scale POI graphs. The implementation of PlaceRep is available at https://github.com/mohammadhashemii/PlaceRep.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Predictive Uncertainty: Reliable Representation Learning with Structural Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16174v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty estimation in machine learning has traditionally focused on the prediction stage, aiming to quantify confidence in model outputs while treating learned representations as deterministic and reliable by default. In this work, we challenge this implicit assumption and argue that reliability should be regarded as a first-class property of learned representations themselves. We propose a principled framework for reliable representation learning that explicitly models representation-level uncertainty and leverages structural constraints as inductive biases to regularize the space of feasible representations. Our approach introduces uncertainty-aware regularization directly in the representation space, encouraging representations that are not only predictive but also stable, well-calibrated, and robust to noise and structural perturbations. Structural constraints, such as sparsity, relational structure, or feature-group dependencies, are incorporated to define meaningful geometry and reduce spurious variability in learned representations, without assuming fully correct or noise-free structure. Importantly, the proposed framework is independent of specific model architectures and can be integrated with a wide range of representation learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, 5 propositions</p></details> |

However, current methods often suffer from "blind" feature interaction, where the model struggles to discern key visual information from background noise due to the sparsity of textual queries. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from human cognitive behavior and propose the Human Vision-Driven (HVD) model. Our framework establishes a coarse-to-fine alignment mechanism comprising two key components: the Frame Features Selection Module (FFSM) and the Patch Features Compression Module (PFCM). FFSM mimics the human macro-perception ability by selecting key frames to eliminate temporal redundancy. Subsequently, PFCM simulates micro-perception by aggregating patch features into salient visual entities through an advanced attention mechanism, enabling precise entity-level matching. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that HVD not only captures human-like visual focus but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Nonetheless, this same philosophy increases the complexity of performing discovery tasks to find relevant data for subsequent processing. As a response to these growing challenges, we present FREYJA, a modern data discovery system capable of effectively exploring data lakes, aimed at finding candidates to perform joins and increase the number of attributes for downstream tasks. More precisely, we want to compute rankings that sort potential joins by their relevance. Modern mechanisms apply advanced table representation learning (TRL) techniques to yield accurate joins. Yet, this incurs high computational costs when dealing with elevated volumes of data. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, we adopt a novel notion of join quality tailored to data lakes, which leverages syntactic measurements while achieving accuracy comparable to that of TRL approaches. To obtain this metric in a scalable manner we train a general purpose predictive model. Predictions are based, rather than on large-scale datasets, on data profiles, succinct representations that capture the underlying characteristics of the data. Our experiments show that our system, FREYJA, matches the results of the state-of-the-art whilst reducing the execution times by several orders of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript was originally accepted for publication in the TKDE journal in January 2026.

In the first stage, a denoising autoencoder is trained to suppress artifacts and stabilize temporal dynamics, providing robust signal representations. In the second stage, a multitask architecture processes these denoised signals to achieve three objectives: motor imagery classification, chaotic versus non-chaotic regime discrimination using Lyapunov exponent-based labels, and self-supervised contrastive representation learning with NT-Xent loss. A convolutional backbone combined with a Transformer encoder captures spatial-temporal structure, while the dynamical task encourages sensitivity to nonlinear brain dynamics. This staged design mitigates interference between reconstruction and discriminative goals, improves stability across datasets, and supports reproducible training by clearly separating noise reduction from higher-level feature learning. Empirical studies show that our framework not only enhances robustness and generalization but also surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods in EEG decoding, highlighting the effectiveness of combining denoising, dynamical features, and self-supervised learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Generative Image Modeling via Joint Image-Feature Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16064v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models (LDMs) dominate high-quality image generation, yet integrating representation learning with generative modeling remains a challenge. We introduce a novel generative image modeling framework that seamlessly bridges this gap by leveraging a diffusion model to jointly model low-level image latents (from a variational autoencoder) and high-level semantic features (from a pretrained self-supervised encoder like DINO). Our latent-semantic diffusion approach learns to generate coherent image-feature pairs from pure noise, significantly enhancing both generative quality and training efficiency, all while requiring only minimal modifications to standard Diffusion Transformer architectures. By eliminating the need for complex distillation objectives, our unified design simplifies training and unlocks a powerful new inference strategy: Representation Guidance, which leverages learned semantics to steer and refine image generation. Evaluated in both conditional and unconditional settings, our method delivers substantial improvements in image quality and training convergence speed, establishing a new direction for representation-aware generative modeling.

A promising strategy involves synthesizing a large dataset with a generative adversarial network (GAN), pre-training a model via self-supervised learning (SSL), and then fine-tuning on the few labeled samples. However, this approach faces a fundamental paradox: conventional GANs themselves require abundant data for stable training, contradicting the premise of few-shot learning. To resolve this, we propose the consistency-regularized generative adversarial network (Cr-GAN), a novel framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples even when trained under these severe data limitations. Cr-GAN introduces a dual-branch discriminator that decouples adversarial training from representation learning. This architecture enables a channel-wise feature interpolation strategy to create novel latent features, complemented by a dual-domain cycle consistency mechanism that ensures semantic integrity. Our Cr-GAN framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures, and its synthesized data effectively boosts multiple SSL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR and SRSDD datasets validate our approach, with Cr-GAN achieving a highly competitive accuracy of 71.21% and 51.64%, respectively, in the 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming leading baselines, while requiring only ~5 of the parameters of state-of-the-art diffusion models.

| **[Divide, Conquer and Unite: Hierarchical Style-Recalibrated Prototype Alignment for Federated Medical Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10945v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.</p></details> | Accepted at AAAI-26 |

Although existing methods employ event data to address this issue, they ignore the sensor-physics mismatches between the camera output and physical world radiance, resulting in suboptimal HDR and deblurring results. To cope with this problem, we propose a unified sensor-physics grounded NeRF framework for sharp HDR novel view synthesis from single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events. We employ NeRF to directly represent the actual radiance of the 3D scene in the HDR domain and model raw HDR scene rays hitting the sensor pixels as in the physical world. A pixel-wise RGB mapping field is introduced to align the above rendered pixel values with the sensor-recorded LDR pixel values of the input images. A novel event mapping field is also designed to bridge the physical scene dynamics and actual event sensor output. The two mapping fields are jointly optimized with the NeRF network, leveraging the spatial and temporal dynamic information in events to enhance the sharp HDR 3D representation learning. Experiments on the collected and public datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art deblurring HDR novel view synthesis results with single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a methodological framework that combines spectral representation learning with transparent statistical modeling to construct a mixture of generalized additive models (GAMs). The approach utilizes random Fourier feature embeddings to uncover locally adaptive structures within the data. High-dimensional random feature representations are compressed via principal component analysis to derive a latent space that informs a Gaussian mixture model, which performs soft clustering to partition the input space into distinct regimes. Within each cluster, a local GAM captures nonlinear univariate effects through interpretable spline-based smoothers. Numerical experiments across diverse regression benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves upon classical global interpretable models by effectively modeling data heterogeneity. Furthermore, the mixture-of-GAMs framework achieves performance comparable to explainable boosting machine, random forest, and multilayer perceptron on certain tasks. Overall, this construction provides a principled approach for integrating representation learning with transparent statistical modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 13 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data, particularly as sequence length and data scale increase. This paper proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the proposed approach, a convolutional neural network operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings, after which a Transformer encoder models inter-patch temporal dependencies to generate forecasts. The method is evaluated on a synthetic multivariate time-series dataset with controlled static and dynamic factors, using an extended sequence length and a larger number of samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms a convolutional baseline under increased temporal context and remains competitive with a strong patch-based Transformer model. These findings indicate that structured patch-level tokenization provides a scalable and effective representation for multivariate time-series forecasting, particularly when longer input sequences are considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, prior research has demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the training set. To address this, previous works have shown that adding self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VB-DemandEx, a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, MambAttention significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art discriminative LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020 without reverberation and EARS-WHAM_v2. MambAttention also matches or outperforms generative diffusion models in generalization performance while being competitive with language model baselines. Ablation studies highlight the importance of weight sharing between time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. Yet, MambAttention remains superior for cross-corpus generalization across all reported evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing</p></details> |

Despite this progress, current LLM-based approaches typically address each task independently, training separate models that raise computational and deployment resource use while missing potential cross-task synergies. They also rely on fixed-rate token compression, which restricts flexibility in balancing accuracy with efficiency. These limitations highlight the need for a unified framework that can support ASR, VSR, and AVSR while enabling elastic inference. To this end, we present Omni-AVSR, a unified audio-visual LLM that combines efficient multi-granularity training with parameter-efficient adaptation. Specifically, we adapt the matryoshka representation learning paradigm to efficiently train across multiple audio and visual granularities, reducing its inherent training resource use. Furthermore, we explore three LoRA-based strategies for adapting the backbone LLM, balancing shared and task-specific specialization. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 show that Omni-AVSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art baselines while training a single model at substantially lower training and deployment resource use. The model also remains robust under acoustic noise, and we analyze its scaling behavior as LLM size increases, providing insights into the trade-off between performance and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICASSP 2026 (camera-ready version).

Existing watermarking methods primarily operate on graph structures or entangled graph representations, which compromise the transparency and robustness of watermarks due to the information coupling in representing graphs and uncontrollable discretization in transforming continuous numerical representations into graph structures. This motivates us to propose DRGW, the first graph watermarking framework that addresses these issues through disentangled representation learning. Specifically, we design an adversarially trained encoder that learns an invariant structural representation against diverse perturbations and derives a statistically independent watermark carrier, ensuring both robustness and transparency of watermarks. Meanwhile, we devise a graph-aware invertible neural network to provide a lossless channel for watermark embedding and extraction, guaranteeing high detectability and transparency of watermarks. Additionally, we develop a structure-aware editor that resolves the issue of latent modifications into discrete graph edits, ensuring robustness against structural perturbations. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness of DRGW.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at The Web Conference 2026 (WWW '26)</p></details> |

However, existing methods still struggle to capture robust depression-related speech characteristics, which are sparse and heterogeneous. Although pretrained self-supervised learning (SSL) models provide rich representations, most recent SDD studies extract features from a single layer of the pretrained SSL model for the downstream classifier. This practice overlooks the complementary roles of low-level acoustic features and high-level semantic information inherently encoded in different SSL model layers. To explicitly model interactions between acoustic and semantic representations within an utterance, we propose a hierarchical adaptive representation encoder with prior knowledge that disengages and re-aligns acoustic and semantic information through asymmetric cross-attention, enabling fine-grained acoustic patterns to be interpreted in semantic context. In addition, a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) objective is applied as auxiliary supervision to handle the irregular temporal distribution of depressive characteristics without requiring frame-level annotations. Experiments on DAIC-WOZ and MODMA demonstrate that HAREN-CTC consistently outperforms existing methods under both performance upper-bound evaluation and generalization evaluation settings, achieving Macro F1 scores of 0.81 and 0.82 respectively in upper-bound evaluation, and maintaining superior performance with statistically significant improvements in precision and AUC under rigorous cross-validation. These findings suggest that modeling hierarchical acoustic-semantic interactions better reflects how depressive characteristics manifest in natural speech, enabling scalable and objective depression assessment.</p></details> |  |

These methods enrich user representations by incorporating social network information into GCF, thereby integrating additional collaborative signals from social relations. However, existing GCF and graph-based SocialRec approaches face significant challenges: they incur high computational costs and suffer from limited scalability due to the large number of parameters required to assign explicit embeddings to all users and items. In this work, we propose PULSE (Parameter-efficient User representation Learning with Social Knowledge), a framework that addresses this limitation by constructing user representations from socially meaningful signals without creating an explicit learnable embedding for each user. PULSE reduces the parameter size by up to 50% compared to the most lightweight GCF baseline. Beyond parameter efficiency, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming 13 GCF and graph-based social recommendation baselines across varying levels of interaction sparsity, from cold-start to highly active users, through a time- and memory-efficient modeling process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WWW 2026, 12pages</p></details> |

However, such methods encounter issues regarding parameter efficiency, interpretability, and robustness. Thus, Quantized Graph Representation (QGR) learning has recently gained increasing interest, which represents the graph structure with discrete codes instead of conventional continuous embeddings. Given its analogous representation form to natural language, QGR also possesses the capability to seamlessly integrate graph structures with large language models (LLMs). As this emerging paradigm is still in its infancy yet holds significant promise, we undertake this thorough survey to promote its rapid future prosperity. We first present the background of the general quantization methods and their merits. Moreover, we provide an in-depth demonstration of current QGR studies from the perspectives of quantized strategies, training objectives, distinctive designs, knowledge graph quantization, and applications. We further explore the strategies for code dependence learning and integration with LLMs. At last, we give discussions and conclude future directions, aiming to provide a comprehensive picture of QGR and inspire future research.</p></details> |  |

Although this paradigm is promising for utilizing unlabeled data, static or random augmentation strategies often fail to preserve intrinsic information due to the non-stationarity of EEG signals where statistical properties change over time. To address this, we propose RL-BioAug, a framework that leverages a label-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) agent to autonomously determine optimal augmentation policies. While utilizing only a minimal fraction (10%) of labeled data to guide the agent's policy, our method enables the encoder to learn robust representations in a strictly self-supervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-BioAug significantly outperforms the random selection strategy, achieving substantial improvements of 9.69% and 8.80% in Macro-F1 score on the Sleep-EDFX and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively. Notably, this agent mainly chose optimal strategies for each task--for example, Time Masking with a 62% probability for sleep stage classification and Crop & Resize with a 77% probability for seizure detection. Our framework suggests its potential to replace conventional heuristic-based augmentations and establish a new autonomous paradigm for data augmentation.

Various forms of contrastive learning help models learn to convert images to embeddings that are useful for classification, detection, and segmentation. On the other hand, models can be trained to reconstruct images with pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial losses in order to learn a latent space that is useful for image generation. We seek to unify these two directions with a first-of-its-kind model that learns representations which are simultaneously useful for recognition and generation. We train our model as a hyper-network for implicit neural representation, which learns to map images to model weights for fast, accurate reconstruction. We further integrate our INR hyper-network with knowledge distillation to improve its generalization and performance. Beyond the novel training design, the model also learns an unprecedented compressed embedding space with outstanding performance for various visual tasks.

However, existing formulations rely on \textit{deterministic} regression objectives, which mask probabilistic semantics and limit its applicability in stochastic control. In this work, we introduce \emph{Variational JEPA (VJEPA)}, a \textit{probabilistic} generalization that learns a predictive distribution over future latent states via a variational objective. We show that VJEPA unifies representation learning with Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and Bayesian filtering, establishing that sequential modeling does not require autoregressive observation likelihoods. Theoretically, we prove that VJEPA representations can serve as sufficient information states for optimal control without pixel reconstruction, while providing formal guarantees for collapse avoidance. We further propose \emph{Bayesian JEPA (BJEPA)}, an extension that factorizes the predictive belief into a learned dynamics expert and a modular prior expert, enabling zero-shot task transfer and constraint (e.g. goal, physics) satisfaction via a Product of Experts. Empirically, through a noisy environment experiment, we demonstrate that VJEPA and BJEPA successfully filter out high-variance nuisance distractors that cause representation collapse in generative baselines. By enabling principled uncertainty estimation (e.g. constructing credible intervals via sampling) while remaining likelihood-free regarding observations, VJEPA provides a foundational framework for scalable, robust, uncertainty-aware planning in high-dimensional, noisy environments.</p></details> | 77 pages |

However, most existing deep learning approaches treat chemical and transcriptomic modalities independently or combine them only at late stages, limiting their ability to model fine-grained, context-dependent mechanisms of drug action. In addition, standard attention mechanisms are often sensitive to noise and sparsity in high-dimensional biological networks, hindering both generalization and interpretability. We present DiSPA, a representation learning framework that explicitly disentangles structure-driven and context-driven mechanisms of drug response through bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression. DiSPA introduces a differential cross-attention module that suppresses spurious pathway-substructure associations while amplifying contextually relevant interactions. Across multiple evaluation settings on the GDSC benchmark, DiSPA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with particularly strong improvements in the disjoint-set setting, which assesses generalization to unseen drug-cell combinations. Beyond predictive accuracy, DiSPA yields mechanistically informative representations: learned attention patterns recover known pharmacophores, distinguish structure-driven from context-dependent compounds, and exhibit coherent organization across biological pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DiSPA trained solely on bulk RNA-seq data enables zero-shot transfer to spatial transcriptomics, revealing region-specific drug sensitivity patterns without retraining. Together, these results establish DiSPA as a robust and interpretable framework for integrative pharmacogenomic modeling, enabling principled analysis of drug response mechanisms beyond post hoc interpretation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fast Coarse-graining and Equation Discovery with Foundation Inference Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12618v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g., the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple, simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relational Database Distillation: From Structured Tables to Condensed Graph Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06980v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational databases (RDBs) underpin the majority of global data management systems, where information is structured into multiple interdependent tables. To effectively use the knowledge within RDBs for predictive tasks, recent advances leverage graph representation learning to capture complex inter-table relations as multi-hop dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance, these methods remain hindered by the prohibitive storage overhead and excessive training time, due to the massive scale of the database and the computational burden of intensive message passing across interconnected tables. To alleviate these concerns, we propose and study the problem of Relational Database Distillation (RDD). Specifically, we aim to distill large-scale RDBs into compact heterogeneous graphs while retaining the predictive power (i.e., utility) required for training graph-based models. Multi-modal column information is preserved through node features, and primary-foreign key relations are encoded via heterogeneous edges, thereby maintaining both data fidelity and relational structure. To ensure adaptability across diverse downstream tasks without engaging the traditional, inefficient bi-level distillation framework, we further design a kernel ridge regression-guided objective with pseudo-labels, which produces quality features for the distilled graph. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world RDBs demonstrate that our solution substantially reduces the data size while maintaining competitive performance on classification and regression tasks, creating an effective pathway for scalable learning with RDBs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Multi-Task Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13886v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current visual representation learning remains bifurcated: vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) excel at global semantic alignment but lack spatial precision, while self-supervised methods (e.g., MAE, DINO) capture intricate local structures yet struggle with high-level semantic context. We argue that these paradigms are fundamentally complementary and can be integrated into a principled multi-task framework, further enhanced by dense spatial supervision. We introduce MTV, a multi-task visual pretraining framework that jointly optimizes a shared backbone across vision-language contrastive, self-supervised, and dense spatial objectives. To mitigate the need for manual annotations, we leverage high-capacity "expert" models -- such as Depth Anything V2 and OWLv2 -- to synthesize dense, structured pseudo-labels at scale. Beyond the framework, we provide a systematic investigation into the mechanics of multi-task visual learning, analyzing: (i) the marginal gain of each objective, (ii) task synergies versus interference, and (iii) scaling behavior across varying data and model scales. Our results demonstrate that MTV achieves "best-of-both-worlds" performance, significantly enhancing fine-grained spatial reasoning without compromising global semantic understanding. Our findings suggest that multi-task learning, fueled by high-quality pseudo-supervision, is a scalable path toward more general visual encoders.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/Becomebright/MTV</p></details> |

However, in existing designs, tight coupling between "membership matrix" and "subspace matrix U" in MCR2 causes redundant coding under incorrect token projection. To this end, we decouple the functional relationship between the "membership matrix" and "subspaces U" in the MCR2 objective and derive an interpretable sparse linear attention operator from unrolled gradient descent of the optimized objective. Specifically, we propose to directly learn the membership matrix from inputs and subsequently derive sparse subspaces from the fullspace S. Consequently, gradient unrolling of the optimized MCR2 objective yields an interpretable sparse linear attention operator: Decoupled Membership-Subspace Attention (DMSA). Experimental results on visual tasks show that simply replacing the attention module in Token Statistics Transformer (ToST) with DMSA (we refer to as DMST) not only achieves a faster coding reduction rate but also outperforms ToST by 1.08%-1.45% in top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Compared with vanilla Transformer architectures, DMST exhibits significantly higher computational efficiency and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages with 6 figures</p></details> |

However, current methods face critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally. To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned, and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2 by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and +5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text retrieval R@5 by +3.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at \url{https://github.com/xiaojieli0903/GenViewPlusPlus}</p></details> |

Despite the potential of recent vision-based methods, they encounter challenges under adverse conditions. Thus, integrating cameras with next-generation 4D imaging radar to achieve unified multi-task perception is highly significant, though research in this domain remains limited. In this paper, we propose Doracamom, the first framework that fuses multi-view cameras and 4D radar for joint 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction, enabling comprehensive environmental perception. Specifically, we introduce a novel Coarse Voxel Queries Generator that integrates geometric priors from 4D radar with semantic features from images to initialize voxel queries, establishing a robust foundation for subsequent Transformer-based refinement. To leverage temporal information, we design a Dual-Branch Temporal Encoder that processes multi-modal temporal features in parallel across BEV and voxel spaces, enabling comprehensive spatio-temporal representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal BEV-Voxel Fusion module that adaptively fuses complementary features through attention mechanisms while employing auxiliary tasks to enhance feature quality. Extensive experiments on the OmniHD-Scenes, View-of-Delft (VoD), and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that Doracamom achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks, establishing new benchmarks for multi-modal 3D perception.

However, this approaches mainly capture dependencies within subsequences but neglect inter-subsequence and inter-channel interactions, which limits forecasting accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose CTPNet, a novel framework that explicitly learns representations from three perspectives: i) inter-channel dependencies, captured by a temporal query-based multi-head attention mechanism; ii) intra-subsequence dependencies, modeled via a Transformer to characterize trend variations; and iii) inter-subsequence dependencies, extracted by reusing the encoder with residual connections to capture global periodic patterns. By jointly integrating these levels, proposed method provides a more holistic representation of temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Mainstream approaches based on modality-invariant and modality-specific factorization or on complex fusion still rely on spatiotemporal mixed modeling. This ignores spatiotemporal heterogeneity, leading to spatiotemporal information asymmetry and thus limited performance. Hence, we propose TSDA, Temporal-Spatial Decouple before Act, which explicitly decouples each modality into temporal dynamics and spatial structural context before any interaction. For every modality, a temporal encoder and a spatial encoder project signals into separate temporal and spatial body. Factor-Consistent Cross-Modal Alignment then aligns temporal features only with their temporal counterparts across modalities, and spatial features only with their spatial counterparts. Factor specific supervision and decorrelation regularization reduce cross factor leakage while preserving complementarity. A Gated Recouple module subsequently recouples the aligned streams for task. Extensive experiments show that TSDA outperforms baselines. Ablation analysis studies confirm the necessity and interpretability of the design.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This study has been accepted by IEEE ICASSP2026</p></details> |

While recent graph-based methods modeling cell-cell interactions have improved clustering accuracy, they remain limited in two key aspects: (i) reliance on local aggregation in static graphs often fails to capture robust global topological structures (e.g., loops and voids) and is vulnerable to noisy edges; and (ii) dimensionality reduction techniques frequently neglect spatial coherence, causing physically adjacent spots to be erroneously separated in the latent space. To overcome these challenges, we propose SPHENIC, a Spatial Persistent Homology-Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, it explicitly incorporates topology-invariant features into the clustering network to ensure robust representation learning against noise. Furthermore, we design a dual-regularized optimization module that imposes spatial constraints alongside distributional optimization, ensuring that the embedding space preserves the physical proximity of cells. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPHENIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.19%-9.14%, validating its superiority in characterizing complex tissue architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

With the emergence of large-scale unlabeled human image datasets, there is an increasing need for a general unsupervised pre-training model capable of supporting diverse human-centric downstream tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose CLASP (CLIP-guided Adaptable Self-suPervised learning), a novel framework designed for unsupervised pre-training in human-centric visual tasks. CLASP leverages the powerful vision-language model CLIP to generate both low-level (e.g., body parts) and high-level (e.g., attributes) semantic pseudo-labels. These multi-level semantic cues are then integrated into the learned visual representations, enriching their expressiveness and generalizability. Recognizing that different downstream tasks demand varying levels of semantic granularity, CLASP incorporates a Prompt-Controlled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module. MoE dynamically adapts feature extraction based on task-specific prompts, mitigating potential feature conflicts and enhancing transferability. Furthermore, CLASP employs a multi-task pre-training strategy, where part- and attribute-level pseudo-labels derived from CLIP guide the representation learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CLASP consistently outperforms existing unsupervised pre-training methods, advancing the field of human-centric visual analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMM (IEEE Transactions on Multimedia), 16 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

Pixel-level annotation of low-light crack images is extremely time-consuming, yet most deep learning methods require large, well-illuminated datasets. We propose a dual-branch prototype learning network integrating Retinex theory with few-shot learning for low-light crack segmentation. Retinex-based reflectance components guide illumination-invariant global representation learning, while metric learning reduces dependence on large annotated datasets. We introduce a cross-similarity prior mask generation module that computes high-dimensional similarities between query and support features to capture crack location and structure, and a multi-scale feature enhancement module that fuses multi-scale features with the prior mask to alleviate spatial inconsistency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance under low-light conditions. Code: https://github.com/YulunGuo/CrackFSS.</p></details> |  |

Triple Classification~(TC) aims to determine the validity of triples from KGs. Recently, text-based methods learn entity and relation representations from natural language descriptions, significantly improving the generalization capabilities of TC models and setting new benchmarks in performance. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing methods often ignore the effective semantic interaction among different KG components. Second, most approaches adopt single binary classification training objective, leading to insufficient semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{SASA}, a novel framework designed to enhance TC models via separated attention mechanism and semantic-aware contrastive learning~(CL). Specifically, we first propose separated attention mechanism to encode triples into decoupled contextual representations and then fuse them through a more effective interactive way. Then, we introduce semantic-aware hierarchical CL as auxiliary training objective to guide models in improving their discriminative capabilities and achieving sufficient semantic learning, considering both local level and global level CL. Experimental results across two benchmark datasets demonstrate that SASA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In terms of accuracy, we advance the state-of-the-art by +5.9\% on FB15k-237 and +3.4\% on YAGO3-10.</p></details> | in progress |

However, it remains highly vulnerable to cyberattacks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data. Developing effective intrusion detection systems (IDS) for IoFT networks faces key challenges, including data imbalance, privacy concerns, and the limited capability of traditional models to detect rare but potentially damaging cyber threats. In this work, we propose PrivFly, a privacy-preserving IDS framework that integrates self-supervised representation learning and differential privacy (DP) to enhance detection performance in imbalanced IoFT network traffic. We propose a masked feature reconstruction module for self-supervised pretraining, improving feature representations and boosting rare-class detection. Differential privacy is applied during training to protect sensitive information without significantly compromising model performance. In addition, we conduct a SHapley additive explanations (SHAP)-based analysis to evaluate the impact of DP on feature importance and model behavior. Experimental results on the ECU-IoFT dataset show that PrivFly achieves up to 98% accuracy and 99% F1-score, effectively balancing privacy and detection performance for secure IoFT systems.</p></details> |  |

We test the spatial affinity component on two self-supervised learning frameworks and show that it outperforms models pretrained on HR or MR images alone.</p></details> |  |

This paper analyzes a comprehensive analysis of YOLO26, an architecture that fundamentally redefines this paradigm by eliminating NMS in favor of a native end-to-end learning strategy. This study examines the critical innovations that enable this transition, specifically the introduction of the MuSGD optimizer for stabilizing lightweight backbones, STAL for small-target-aware assignment, and ProgLoss for dynamic supervision. Through a systematic review of official performance benchmarks, the results demonstrate that YOLO26 establishes a new Pareto front, outperforming a comprehensive suite of predecessors and state-of-the-art competitors (including RTMDet and DAMO-YOLO) in both inference speed and detection accuracy. The analysis confirms that by decoupling representation learning from heuristic post-processing, YOLOv26 successfully resolves the historical trade-off between latency and precision, signaling the next evolutionary step in edge-based computer vision.</p></details> |  |

Together, they provide an end-to-end pipeline for high-precision multimodal search by mapping diverse modalities, including text, images, document images, and video, into a unified representation space. The Qwen3-VL-Embedding model employs a multi-stage training paradigm, progressing from large-scale contrastive pre-training to reranking model distillation, to generate semantically rich high-dimensional vectors. It supports Matryoshka Representation Learning, enabling flexible embedding dimensions, and handles inputs up to 32k tokens. Complementing this, Qwen3-VL-Reranker performs fine-grained relevance estimation for query-document pairs using a cross-encoder architecture with cross-attention mechanisms. Both model series inherit the multilingual capabilities of Qwen3-VL, supporting more than 30 languages, and are released in $\textbf{2B}$ and $\textbf{8B}$ parameter sizes to accommodate diverse deployment requirements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3-VL-Embedding series achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse multimodal embedding evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, Qwen3-VL-Embedding-8B attains an overall score of $\textbf{77.8}$ on MMEB-V2, ranking first among all models (as of January 8, 2025). This report presents the architecture, training methodology, and practical capabilities of the series, demonstrating their effectiveness on various multimodal retrieval tasks, including image-text retrieval, visual question answering, and video-text matching.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they struggle to internalize multi hop, logic driven motifs such as fund dispersal and layering that characterize sophisticated money laundering, limiting their forensic accountability under regulations like the FATF Travel Rule. To address this limitation, we propose Relational Domain Logic Integration (RDLI), a framework that embeds expert derived heuristics as differentiable, logic aware latent signals within representation learning. Unlike static rule based approaches, RDLI enables the detection of complex transactional flows that evade standard message passing. To further account for market volatility, we incorporate a Retrieval Grounded Context (RGC) module that conditions anomaly scoring on regulatory and macroeconomic context, mitigating false positives caused by benign regime shifts. Under extreme label scarcity (0.01%), RDLI outperforms state of the art GNN baselines by 28.9% in F1 score. A micro expert user study further confirms that RDLI path level explanations significantly improve trustworthiness, perceived usefulness, and clarity compared to existing methods, highlighting the importance of integrating domain logic with contextual grounding for both accuracy and explainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Gyuye...</summary><p>Gyuyeon Na, Minjung Park, Soyoun Kim contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

We introduce SDF-HOLO (Systemic Dual-stream Fusion Holo Model), a multimodal foundation model for holistic total-body PET/CT, pre-trained on more than 10,000 patients. SDF-HOLO decouples CT and PET representation learning with dual-stream encoders and couples them through a cross-modal interaction module, allowing anatomical context to refine PET aggregation while metabolic saliency guides subtle morphological reasoning. To model long-range dependencies across the body, hierarchical context modeling combines efficient local windows with global attention. To bridge voxels and clinical language, we use anatomical segmentation masks as explicit semantic anchors and perform voxel-mask-text alignment during pre-training. Across tumor segmentation, low-dose lesion detection, and multilingual diagnostic report generation, SDF-HOLO outperforms strong task-specific and clinical-reference baselines while reducing localization errors and hallucinated findings. Beyond focal interpretation, the model enables system-wide metabolic profiling and reveals tumor-associated fingerprints of inter-organ metabolic network interactions, providing a scalable computational foundation for total-body PET/CT diagnostics and system-level precision oncology.</p></details> |  |
| **[We Think, Therefore We Align LLMs to Helpful, Harmless and Honest Before They Go Wrong](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22510v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) along multiple objectives-helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH)-is critical for safe and reliable deployment. Prior work has used steering vector-small control signals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via one-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single alignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for other objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches extend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While this alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize each objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs across HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch Steering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient multi-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the Transformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage II, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a policy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while maintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca, BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment across multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared to a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, directly transferring it to magnetic resonance images faces two key challenges: the inability to adapt to the specificity of medical anatomical structures and the limitations brought about by the privacy and scarcity of medical data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Self-Supervised Pretrained Transformer (SSPFormer) for MRI images, which effectively learns domain-specific feature representations of medical images by leveraging unlabeled raw imaging data. To tackle the domain gap and data scarcity, we introduce inverse frequency projection masking, which prioritizes the reconstruction of high-frequency anatomical regions to enforce structure-aware representation learning. Simultaneously, to enhance robustness against real-world MRI artifacts, we employ frequency-weighted FFT noise enhancement that injects physiologically realistic noise into the Fourier domain. Together, these strategies enable the model to learn domain-invariant and artifact-robust features directly from raw scans. Through extensive experiments on segmentation, super-resolution, and denoising tasks, the proposed SSPFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, fully verifying its ability to capture fine-grained MRI image fidelity and adapt to clinical application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Undergraduate student as first author submitted to IJCAI</p></details> |

In parallel, submodular and combinatorial information measures (SIMs) have recently been proposed as a principled framework for extending entropy, mutual information, and conditional mutual information to general submodular functions, and have been used extensively in data subset selection, active learning, domain adaptation, and representation learning. This raises a natural and fundamental question: are the monotone submodular functions most commonly used in practice entropic? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for a broad class of widely used polymatroid functions. We provide explicit entropic constructions for set cover and coverage functions, facility location, saturated coverage, concave-over-modular functions via truncations, and monotone graph-cut-type objectives. Our results show that these functions can be realized exactly as Shannon entropies of appropriately constructed random variables. As a consequence, for these functions, submodular mutual information coincides with classical mutual information, conditional gain specializes to conditional entropy, and submodular conditional mutual information reduces to standard conditional mutual information in the entropic sense. These results establish a direct bridge between combinatorial information measures and classical information theory for many of the most common submodular objectives used in applications.</p></details> |  |

Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.</p></details> | Accepted By AAAI2026 |

Although some recent methods achieve identifiability in the instantaneous causality case, they require either interventions on the latent variables or grouping of the observations, which are in general difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose an \textbf{ID}entification framework for instantane\textbf{O}us \textbf{L}atent dynamics (\textbf{IDOL}) by imposing a sparse influence constraint that the latent causal processes have sparse time-delayed and instantaneous relations. Specifically, we establish identifiability results of the latent causal process based on sufficient variability and the sparse influence constraint by employing contextual information of time series data. Based on these theories, we incorporate a temporally variational inference architecture to estimate the latent variables and a gradient-based sparsity regularization to identify the latent causal process. Experimental results on simulation datasets illustrate that our method can identify the latent causal process. Furthermore, evaluations on multiple human motion forecasting benchmarks with instantaneous dependencies indicate the effectiveness of our method in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved cystic hygroma detection from prenatal imaging using ultrasound-specific self-supervised representation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22730v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cystic hygroma is a high-risk prenatal ultrasound finding that portends high rates of chromosomal abnormalities, structural malformations, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases. Paired statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that performance improvements achieved by USF-MAE were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[REF-VLM: Triplet-Based Referring Paradigm for Unified Visual Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07413v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate robust zero-shot capabilities across diverse vision-language tasks after training on mega-scale datasets. However, dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and keypoint detection, pose significant challenges for MLLMs when represented solely as text outputs. Simultaneously, current MLLMs utilizing latent embeddings for visual task decoding generally demonstrate limited adaptability to both multi-task learning and multi-granularity scenarios. In this work, we present \textbf{REF-VLM}, an end-to-end framework for unified training of various visual decoding tasks. To address complex visual decoding scenarios, we introduce the \textbf{Triplet-Based Referring Paradigm (TRP)}, which explicitly decouples three critical dimensions in visual decoding tasks through a triplet structure: concepts, decoding types, and targets. TRP employs symbolic delimiters to enforce structured representation learning, enhancing the parsability and interpretability of model outputs. Additionally, we construct \textbf{Visual-Task Instruction Following Dataset (VT-Instruct)}, a large-scale multi-task dataset containing over 100 million multimodal dialogue samples across 25 task types. Beyond text inputs and outputs, VT-Instruct incorporates various visual prompts such as point, box, scribble, and mask, and generates outputs composed of text and visual units like box, keypoint, depth and mask. The combination of different visual prompts and visual units generates a wide variety of task types, expanding the applicability of REF-VLM significantly. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our REF-VLM outperforms other MLLMs across a variety of standard benchmarks. The code, dataset, and demo will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[HCFT: Hierarchical Convolutional Fusion Transformer for EEG Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12279v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) decoding requires models that can effectively extract and integrate complex temporal, spectral, and spatial features from multichannel signals. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight and generalizable decoding framework named Hierarchical Convolutional Fusion Transformer (HCFT), which combines dual-branch convolutional encoders and hierarchical Transformer blocks for multi-scale EEG representation learning. Specifically, the model first captures local temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics through time-domain and time-space convolutional branches, and then aligns these features via a cross-attention mechanism that enables interaction between branches at each stage. Subsequently, a hierarchical Transformer fusion structure is employed to encode global dependencies across all feature stages, while a customized Dynamic Tanh normalization module is introduced to replace traditional Layer Normalization in order to enhance training stability and reduce redundancy. Extensive experiments are conducted on two representative benchmark datasets, BCI Competition IV-2b and CHB-MIT, covering both event-related cross-subject classification and continuous seizure prediction tasks. Results show that HCFT achieves 80.83% average accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.6165 on BCI IV-2b, as well as 99.10% sensitivity, 0.0236 false positives per hour, and 98.82% specificity on CHB-MIT, consistently outperforming over ten state-of-the-art baseline methods. Ablation studies confirm that each core component of the proposed framework contributes significantly to the overall decoding performance, demonstrating HCFT's effectiveness in capturing EEG dynamics and its potential for real-world BCI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journals</p></details> |
| **[A Stage-Wise Learning Strategy with Fixed Anchors for Robust Speaker Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18530v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robust speaker representations under noisy conditions presents significant challenges, which requires careful handling of both discriminative and noise-invariant properties. In this work, we proposed an anchor-based stage-wise learning strategy for robust speaker representation learning. Specifically, our approach begins by training a base model to establish discriminative speaker boundaries, and then extract anchor embeddings from this model as stable references. Finally, a copy of the base model is fine-tuned on noisy inputs, regularized by enforcing proximity to their corresponding fixed anchor embeddings to preserve speaker identity under distortion. Experimental results suggest that this strategy offers advantages over conventional joint optimization, particularly in maintaining discrimination while improving noise robustness. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements across various noise conditions, potentially due to its ability to handle boundary stabilization and variation suppression separately.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Wavelet-Driven Masked Multiscale Reconstruction for PPG Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12215v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable foundation models have the potential to transform digital health by learning transferable representations from large-scale biosignals collected in everyday settings. While recent progress has been made in large-scale pretraining, most approaches overlook the spectral structure of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, wherein physiological rhythms unfold across multiple frequency bands. Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data. The pretraining task is designed to reconstruct randomly masked out coefficients obtained from a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition of PPG signals, forcing the transformer encoder to integrate information across temporal and spectral scales. We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines. Extensive analysis of our learned embeddings and systematic ablations underscores the value of wavelet-based representations, showing that they capture robust and physiologically-grounded features. Together, these results highlight the potential of MMR as a step toward generalizable PPG foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dimensionality Reduction for Remote Sensing Data Analysis: A Systematic Review of Methods and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18935v2)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an ever-growing mass of data. This planetary data is crucial for addressing relevant societal, economic, and environmental challenges, ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, its high dimensionality entails significant feature redundancy and computational overhead limiting the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by preserving essential data properties while reducing redundancy and enhancing tasks in Remote Sensing (RS). The landscape of DR for RS is a diverse, disorganized, and rapidly evolving field. We offer a practical guide for this landscape by introducing a framework of DR. Using this framework, we trace the evolution of DR across the data value chain in RS. Finally, we synthesize these trends and offer perspectives for the future of DR in RS by first characterizing this shift from single-task models to unified representations, then identifying two perspectives in the foundation model era: the need for robust and interpretable DR and the potential of bridging classical DR with modern representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Language-Driven Sequence-Level Modal-Invariant Representations for Video-Based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12062v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The core of video-based visible-infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) lies in learning sequence-level modal-invariant representations across different modalities. Recent research tends to use modality-shared language prompts generated by CLIP to guide the learning of modal-invariant representations. Despite achieving optimal performance, such methods still face limitations in efficient spatial-temporal modeling, sufficient cross-modal interaction, and explicit modality-level loss guidance. To address these issues, we propose the language-driven sequence-level modal-invariant representation learning (LSMRL) method, which includes spatial-temporal feature learning (STFL) module, semantic diffusion (SD) module and cross-modal interaction (CMI) module. To enable parameter- and computation-efficient spatial-temporal modeling, the STFL module is built upon CLIP with minimal modifications. To achieve sufficient cross-modal interaction and enhance the learning of modal-invariant features, the SD module is proposed to diffuse modality-shared language prompts into visible and infrared features to establish preliminary modal consistency. The CMI module is further developed to leverage bidirectional cross-modal self-attention to eliminate residual modality gaps and refine modal-invariant representations. To explicitly enhance the learning of modal-invariant representations, two modality-level losses are introduced to improve the features' discriminative ability and their generalization to unseen categories. Extensive experiments on large-scale VVI-ReID datasets demonstrate the superiority of LSMRL over AOTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Driven Prompt Learning: A Joint Framework for Multi-modal Cloud Removal and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12052v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical remote sensing imagery is indispensable for Earth observation, yet persistent cloud occlusion limits its downstream utility. Most cloud removal (CR) methods are optimized for low-level fidelity and can over-smooth textures and boundaries that are critical for analysis-ready data (ARD), leading to a mismatch between visually plausible restoration and semantic utility. To bridge this gap, we propose TDP-CR, a task-driven multimodal framework that jointly performs cloud removal and land-cover segmentation. Central to our approach is a Prompt-Guided Fusion (PGF) mechanism, which utilizes a learnable degradation prompt to encode cloud thickness and spatial uncertainty. By combining global channel context with local prompt-conditioned spatial bias, PGF adaptively integrates Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) information only where optical data is corrupted. We further introduce a parameter-efficient two-phase training strategy that decouples reconstruction and semantic representation learning. Experiments on the LuojiaSET-OSFCR dataset demonstrate the superiority of our framework: TDP-CR surpasses heavy state-of-the-art baselines by 0.18 dB in PSNR while using only 15\% of the parameters, and achieves a 1.4\% improvement in mIoU consistently against multi-task competitors, effectively delivering analysis-ready data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IGARSS 2026 Conference</p></details> |
| **[LLMs Meet Isolation Kernel: Lightweight, Learning-free Binary Embeddings for Fast Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09159v2)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled remarkable progress in text representation. However, their embeddings are typically high-dimensional, leading to substantial storage and retrieval overhead. Although recent approaches such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) alleviate these issues to some extent, they still suffer from retrieval accuracy degradation. This paper proposes \emph{Isolation Kernel Embedding} or IKE, a learning-free method that transforms an LLM embedding into a binary embedding using Isolation Kernel (IK). IKE is an ensemble of diverse (random) partitions, enabling robust estimation of ideal kernel in the LLM embedding space, thus reducing retrieval accuracy loss as the ensemble grows. Lightweight and based on binary encoding, it offers low memory footprint and fast bitwise computation, lowering retrieval latency. Experiments on multiple text retrieval datasets demonstrate that IKE offers up to 16.7x faster retrieval and 16x lower memory usage than LLM embeddings, while maintaining comparable or better accuracy. Compared to CSR and other compression methods, IKE consistently achieves the best balance between retrieval efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Semantic-Geometric Task Graph-Representations from Human Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11460v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning structured task representations from human demonstrations is essential for understanding long-horizon manipulation behaviors, particularly in bimanual settings where action ordering, object involvement, and interaction geometry can vary significantly. A key challenge lies in jointly capturing the discrete semantic structure of tasks and the temporal evolution of object-centric geometric relations in a form that supports reasoning over task progression. In this work, we introduce a semantic-geometric task graph-representation that encodes object identities, inter-object relations, and their temporal geometric evolution from human demonstrations. Building on this formulation, we propose a learning framework that combines a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) encoder with a Transformer-based decoder, decoupling scene representation learning from action-conditioned reasoning about task progression. The encoder operates solely on temporal scene graphs to learn structured representations, while the decoder conditions on action-context to predict future action sequences, associated objects, and object motions over extended time horizons. Through extensive evaluation on human demonstration datasets, we show that semantic-geometric task graph-representations are particularly beneficial for tasks with high action and object variability, where simpler sequence-based models struggle to capture task progression. Finally, we demonstrate that task graph representations can be transferred to a physical bimanual robot and used for online action selection, highlighting their potential as reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making in manipulation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, preprint</p></details> |

Using a neural encoder trained exclusively on non-Gaussian instrumental glitches, we perform strict zero-shot anomaly analysis on rolling-element bearings without retraining, fine-tuning, or target-domain labels. On the IMS-NASA run-to-failure dataset, the operator yields a monotonic health index HI(t) = s0.99(t)/tau normalized to an early-life reference distribution, enabling fixed false-alarm monitoring at 1-q = 1e-3 with tau = Q0.999(P0). In discrete fault regimes (CWRU), it achieves strong window-level discrimination (AUC_win about 0.90) and file-level separability approaching unity (AUC_file about 0.99). Electrically dominated vibration signals (VSB) show weak, non-selective behavior, delineating a physical boundary for transfer. Under a matched IMS controlled-split protocol, a generic EfficientNet-B0 encoder pretrained on ImageNet collapses in the intermittent regime (Lambda_tail about 2), while the interferometric operator retains strong extreme-event selectivity (Lambda_tail about 860), indicating that the effect is not a generic property of CNN features. Controlled morphology-destruction transformations selectively degrade performance despite per-window normalization, consistent with sensitivity to coherent time-frequency organization rather than marginal amplitude statistics.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures.

Classical Beer-Lambert (BL) color deconvolution is well-established for two- or three-stain settings, but becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC (mIHC) with K>3 chromogens. We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with a perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms that discourage unnecessary stain mixing. On a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8) we show excellent RGB reconstruction, and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution. Code and model are available at https://github.com/measty/StainQuant.git.</p></details> |  |

We derive the achievable capacity, the achievable representation-rate, and their converse. Finally, we combine the results in a unified setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Representation Learning for Alignment of Tactile, Language, and Vision Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11512v4)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tactile sensing offers rich and complementary information to vision and language, enabling robots to perceive fine-grained object properties. However, existing tactile sensors lack standardization, leading to redundant features that hinder cross-sensor generalization. Moreover, existing methods fail to fully integrate the intermediate communication among tactile, language, and vision modalities. To address this, we propose TLV-CoRe, a CLIP-based Tactile-Language-Vision Collaborative Representation learning method. TLV-CoRe introduces a Sensor-Aware Modulator to unify tactile features across different sensors and employs tactile-irrelevant decoupled learning to disentangle irrelevant tactile features. Additionally, a Unified Bridging Adapter is introduced to enhance tri-modal interaction within the shared representation space. To fairly evaluate the effectiveness of tactile models, we further propose the RSS evaluation framework, focusing on Robustness, Synergy, and Stability across different methods. Experimental results demonstrate that TLV-CoRe significantly improves sensor-agnostic representation learning and cross-modal alignment, offering a new direction for multimodal tactile representation.</p></details> |  |

SAEs can uncover high-quality, interpretable features at different levels of granularity and enable targeted steering of the generation process by selectively activating specific neurons in their latent activations. Our paper is the first to apply this approach to collaborative filtering, aiming to extract similarly interpretable features from representations learned purely from interaction signals. In particular, we focus on a widely adopted class of collaborative autoencoders (CFAEs) and augment them by inserting an SAE between their encoder and decoder networks. We demonstrate that such representation is largely monosemantic and propose suitable mapping functions between semantic concepts and individual neurons. We also evaluate a simple yet effective method that utilizes this representation to steer the recommendations in a desired direction.</p></details> |  |

Linear attention reduces the cost to O(N), yet its compressed state representations can impair modeling capacity and accuracy. We present an analytical study that contrasts linear and softmax attention for visual representation learning from a layer-stacking perspective. We further conduct systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns of linear and softmax attention. Our results show that, compared with rigid intra-block hybrid designs, fine-grained layer-wise hybridization can match or surpass performance while requiring fewer softmax layers. Building on these findings, we propose SoLA-Vision (Softmax-Linear Attention Vision), a flexible layer-wise hybrid attention backbone that enables fine-grained control over how linear and softmax attention are integrated. By strategically inserting a small number of global softmax layers, SoLA-Vision achieves a strong trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. On ImageNet-1K, SoLA-Vision outperforms purely linear and other hybrid attention models. On dense prediction tasks, it consistently surpasses strong baselines by a considerable margin. Code will be released.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Clustering High-dimensional Data: Balancing Abstraction and Representation Tutorial at AAAI 2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11160v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to find a natural grouping of a large real data set? Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects. Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data. The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning. So, there is still much room for improvement.</p></details> |  |

This work identifies a core bottleneck: the prevailing ``LLM+CL'' paradigm focuses on semantic alignment but cannot perform knowledge acquisition, leading to failures on specialized terminology. To bridge this gap, we propose Learn Before Represent (LBR), a novel two-stage framework. LBR first injects domain knowledge via an Information Bottleneck-Constrained Generative Learning stage, preserving the LLM's causal attention to maximize knowledge acquisition while compressing semantics. It then performs Generative-Refined Contrastive Learning on the compressed representations for alignment. This approach maintains architectural consistency and resolves the objective conflict between generative and contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on medical, chemistry, and code retrieval tasks show that LBR significantly outperforms strong baselines. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building accurate and robust representations in vertical domains.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

In the practical recommendation scenario, low-exposure items constitute the majority of interactions, creating a long-tail distribution that severely compromises recommendation diversity. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by promoting tail items but incur accuracy degradation, exhibiting a "see-saw" effect between long-tail and accuracy performance. We attribute such conflict to session-irrelevant noise within the tail items, which existing long-tail approaches fail to identify and constrain effectively. To resolve this fundamental conflict, we propose \textbf{HID} (\textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{I}ntent-based \textbf{D}ual Constraint Framework), a plug-and-play framework that transforms the conventional "see-saw" into "win-win" through introducing the hybrid intent-based dual constraints for both long-tail and accuracy. Two key innovations are incorporated in this framework: (i) \textit{Hybrid Intent Learning}, where we reformulate the intent extraction strategies by employing attribute-aware spectral clustering to reconstruct the item-to-intent mapping. Furthermore, discrimination of session-irrelevant noise is achieved through the assignment of the target and noise intents to each session. (ii) \textit{Intent Constraint Loss}, which incorporates two novel constraint paradigms regarding the \textit{diversity} and \textit{accuracy} to regulate the representation learning process of both items and sessions. These two objectives are unified into a single training loss through rigorous theoretical derivation. Extensive experiments across multiple SBR models and datasets demonstrate that HID can enhance both long-tail performance and recommendation accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in long-tail recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI 2026 Oral</p></details> |

In these attacks, adversaries can manipulate pretraining data or model updates to insert hidden malicious behavior. This paper offers a thorough and comparative review of backdoor attacks in contrastive learning. It analyzes threat models, attack methods, target domains, and available defenses. We summarize recent advancements in this area, underline the specific vulnerabilities inherent to contrastive learning, and discuss the challenges and future research directions. Our findings have significant implications for the secure deployment of systems in industrial and distributed environments.</p></details> |  |

Early methods primarily relied on shallow fusion techniques to capture correlations between text and images, but they struggled with high-level semantic understanding and complex cross-modal interactions. The emergence of LVLMs has fundamentally changed this landscape by enabling joint modeling of vision and language with powerful representation learning, thereby enhancing the ability to detect misinformation that leverages both textual narratives and visual content. Despite these advances, the field lacks a systematic survey that traces this transition and consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of MFND through the lens of LVLMs. We first present a historical perspective, mapping the evolution from conventional multimodal detection pipelines to foundation model-driven paradigms. Next, we establish a structured taxonomy covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining technical challenges, including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the next stage of this paradigm shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to systematically document and analyze the transformative role of LVLMs in combating multimodal fake news.

However, existing deep learning approaches often overlook the brain's intrinsic spatial organization, failing to simultaneously capture local topological relations and global dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose Neuro-HGLN, a Neurologically-informed Hierarchical Graph-Transformer Learning Network that integrates biologically grounded priors with hierarchical representation learning. Neuro-HGLN first constructs a spatial Euclidean prior graph based on physical electrode distances to serve as an anatomically grounded inductive bias. A learnable global dynamic graph is then introduced to model functional connectivity across the entire brain. In parallel, to capture fine-grained regional dependencies, Neuro-HGLN builds region-level local graphs using a multi-head self-attention mechanism. These graphs are processed synchronously through local-constrained parallel GCN layers to produce region-specific representations. Subsequently, an iTransformer encoder aggregates these features to capture cross-region dependencies under a dimension-as-token formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neuro-HGLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, providing enhanced interpretability grounded in neurophysiological structure. These results highlight the efficacy of unifying local topological learning with cross-region dependency modeling for robust EEG emotion recognition.</p></details> |  |

RL requires large-scale simulation and can still cause long training times, slowing research and innovation. This issue is particularly pronounced in vision-based control tasks where reliable state estimates are not accessible. Differentiable simulation offers an alternative by enabling gradient back-propagation through the dynamics model, providing low-variance analytical policy gradients and, hence, higher sample efficiency. However, its usage for real-world robotic tasks has yet been limited. This work demonstrates the great potential of differentiable simulation for learning quadrotor control. We show that training in differentiable simulation significantly outperforms model-free RL in terms of both sample efficiency and training time, allowing a policy to learn to recover a quadrotor in seconds when providing vehicle states and in minutes when relying solely on visual features. The key to our success is two-fold. First, the use of a simple surrogate model for gradient computation greatly accelerates training without sacrificing control performance.

| **[Learning Without Augmenting: Unsupervised Time Series Representation Learning via Frame Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22655v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning representations without labeled data. Most SSL approaches rely on strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches.

| **[MMPG: MoE-based Adaptive Multi-Perspective Graph Fusion for Protein Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10157v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted for Protein Representation Learning (PRL), as residue interaction networks can be naturally represented as graphs. Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric and Dynamic Scaling in Deep Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01014v3)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their empirical success, pushing Transformer architectures to extreme depth often leads to a paradoxical failure: representations become increasingly redundant, lose rank, and ultimately collapse. Existing explanations largely attribute this phenomenon to optimization instability or vanishing gradients, yet such accounts fail to explain why collapse persists even under modern normalization and initialization schemes. In this paper, we argue that the collapse of deep Transformers is fundamentally a geometric problem. Standard residual updates implicitly assume that feature accumulation is always beneficial, but offer no mechanism to constrain update directions or to erase outdated information. As depth increases, this leads to systematic drift off the semantic manifold and monotonic feature accumulation, causing representational degeneracy. We propose a unified geometric framework that addresses these failures through two orthogonal principles. First, manifold-constrained hyper-connections restrict residual updates to valid local tangent directions, preventing uncontrolled manifold drift. Second, deep delta learning introduces data-dependent, non-monotonic updates that enable reflection and erasure of redundant features rather than their unconditional accumulation. Together, these mechanisms decouple the direction and sign of feature updates, yielding a stable geometric evolution across depth. We term the resulting architecture the Manifold-Geometric Transformer (MGT). Our analysis predicts that enforcing geometric validity while allowing dynamic erasure is essential for avoiding rank collapse in ultra-deep networks. We outline an evaluation protocol for Transformers exceeding 100 layers to test the hypothesis that geometry, rather than depth itself, is the key limiting factor in deep representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Resea...</summary><p>Research Proposal Only</p></details> |

We ask a different question: Can we improve the performance of open-weight CLIP models across various downstream tasks using only existing self-supervised datasets? Unlike supervised fine-tuning, which adapts a pretrained model to a single downstream task, our setting seeks to improve general performance across various tasks. However, as both our experiments and prior studies reveal, simply applying standard training protocols starting from an open-weight CLIP model often fails, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce TuneCLIP, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes the performance degradation. TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage of recovering optimization statistics to reduce cold-start bias, inspired by theoretical analysis, and (2) a fine-tuning stage of optimizing a new contrastive loss to mitigate the penalization on false negative pairs. Our extensive experiments show that TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales. Notably, it elevates leading open-weight models like SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving gains of up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the highly competitive DataComp benchmark, setting a new strong baseline for efficient post-pretraining adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

It has been shown that hidden representations learned by deep models can encode sensitive information from the input, making it possible for adversaries to recover the input data with considerable accuracy. This problem is exacerbated in transformer embeddings because they consist of multiple vectors, one per token. To mitigate this risk, we propose Nonparametric Variational Differential Privacy (NVDP), which ensures both useful data sharing and strong privacy protection. We take a differential privacy (DP) approach, integrating a nonparametric variational information bottleneck (NVIB) layer into the transformer architecture to inject noise into its multivector embeddings and thereby hide information, and measuring privacy protection with Rényi Divergence (RD) and its corresponding Bayesian Differential Privacy (BDP) guarantee. Training the NVIB layer calibrates the noise level according to the utility of the downstream task. We test NVDP on the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark and show that varying the noise level gives us a useful trade-off between privacy and accuracy. With lower noise levels, our model maintains high accuracy while offering strong privacy guarantees, effectively balancing privacy and utility.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

Leveraging large volumes of unlabeled brain MRI data, such models can learn anatomical priors that improve few-shot performance in diverse neuroimaging tasks. However, most SSL frameworks are tailored to natural images, and their adaptation to capture multi-modal MRI information remains underexplored. This work proposes a modality-invariant representation learning setup and evaluates its effectiveness in stroke and epilepsy lesion segmentation, following large-scale pre-training. Experimental results suggest that despite successful cross-modality alignment, lesion segmentation primarily benefits from preserving fine-grained modality-specific features.

However, most existing AMP classification methods rely primarily on sequence-based representations and fail to capture the spatial structural information critical for accurate identification. Although recent graph-based approaches attempt to incorporate structural information, they typically construct residue- or atom-level graphs that introduce redundant atomic details and increase structural complexity. Furthermore, the class imbalance between the small number of known AMPs and the abundant non-AMPs significantly hinders predictive performance. To address these challenges, we employ lightweight OmegaFold to predict the three-dimensional structures of peptides and construct peptide graphs using C α atoms to capture their backbone geometry and spatial topology. Building on this representation, we propose the Spatial GNN-based AMP Classifier (SGAC), a novel framework that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract structural features and generate discriminative graph representations. To handle class imbalance, SGAC incorporates Weight-enhanced Contrastive Learning to cluster structurally similar peptides and separate dissimilar ones through adaptive weighting, and applies Weight-enhanced Pseudo-label Distillation to generate high-confidence pseudo labels for unlabeled samples, achieving balanced and consistent representation learning. Experiments on publicly available AMP and non-AMP datasets demonstrate that SGAC significantly achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangle Object and Non-object Infrared Features via Language Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09228v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared object detection focuses on identifying and locating objects in complex environments (\eg, dark, snow, and rain) where visible imaging cameras are disabled by poor illumination. However, due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, it is challenging to extract discriminative object features for robust detection. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection. An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on two benchmarks: M\textsuperscript{3}FD (83.7\% mAP), FLIR (86.1\% mAP). Our code will be publicly available once the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |

While datasets with natural images are abundant, medical image datasets can not afford the same luxury. To enable representation learning for medical images at scale, we turn to YouTube, a platform with a large reservoir of open-source medical pedagogical videos. We curate MedicalNarratives, a dataset 4.7M medical image-text pairs, with 1M samples containing dense annotations in the form of spatial traces (and bounding boxes), and 118K videos centered on the trace event (with aligned text), enabling spatiotemporal grounding beyond single frames. Similar to $\textit{think-aloud}$ studies where instructors speak while hovering their mouse cursor movements over relevant image regions, 1M images in MedicalNarratives contains localized mouse traces in image pixels, creating a spatial and temporal association between the text and pixels. To evaluate the utility of MedicalNarratives, we train GenMedClip with a CLIP-like objective using our dataset spanning 12 medical domains. GenMedClip outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on all 12 domains on a newly constructed medical imaging benchmark. $\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/wisdomik/MedicalNarratives}{[Data]}$</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Latent Homeomorphic Manifolds: Cross-Domain Representation Learning via Homeomorphism Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09025v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the Universal Latent Homeomorphic Manifold (ULHM), a framework that unifies semantic representations (e.g., human descriptions, diagnostic labels) and observation-driven machine representations (e.g., pixel intensities, sensor readings) into a single latent structure. Despite originating from fundamentally different pathways, both modalities capture the same underlying reality. We establish \emph{homeomorphism}, a continuous bijection preserving topological structure, as the mathematical criterion for determining when latent manifolds induced by different semantic-observation pairs can be rigorously unified. This criterion provides theoretical guarantees for three critical applications: (1) semantic-guided sparse recovery from incomplete observations, (2) cross-domain transfer learning with verified structural compatibility, and (3) zero-shot compositional learning via valid transfer from semantic to observation space. Our framework learns continuous manifold-to-manifold transformations through conditional variational inference, avoiding brittle point-to-point mappings. We develop practical verification algorithms, including trust, continuity, and Wasserstein distance metrics, that empirically validate homeomorphic structure from finite samples. Experiments demonstrate: (1) sparse image recovery from 5\% of CelebA pixels and MNIST digit reconstruction at multiple sparsity levels, (2) cross-domain classifier transfer achieving 86.73\% accuracy from MNIST to Fashion-MNIST without retraining, and (3) zero-shot classification on unseen classes achieving 89.47\% on MNIST, 84.70\% on Fashion-MNIST, and 78.76\% on CIFAR-10. Critically, the homeomorphism criterion correctly rejects incompatible datasets, preventing invalid unification and providing a feasible way to principled decomposition of general foundation models into verified domain-specific components.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aggregating Diverse Cue Experts for AI-Generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08790v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid emergence of image synthesis models poses challenges to the generalization of AI-generated image detectors. However, existing methods often rely on model-specific features, leading to overfitting and poor generalization. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Cue Aggregation Network (MCAN), a novel framework that integrates different yet complementary cues in a unified network. MCAN employs a mixture-of-encoders adapter to dynamically process these cues, enabling more adaptive and robust feature representation. Our cues include the input image itself, which represents the overall content, and high-frequency components that emphasize edge details. Additionally, we introduce a Chromatic Inconsistency (CI) cue, which normalizes intensity values and captures noise information introduced during the image acquisition process in real images, making these noise patterns more distinguishable from those in AI-generated content. Unlike prior methods, MCAN's novelty lies in its unified multi-cue aggregation framework, which integrates spatial, frequency-domain, and chromaticity-based information for enhanced representation learning. These cues are intrinsically more indicative of real images, enhancing cross-model generalization. Extensive experiments on the GenImage, Chameleon, and UniversalFakeDetect benchmark validate the state-of-the-art performance of MCAN. In the GenImage dataset, MCAN outperforms the best state-of-the-art method by up to 7.4% in average ACC across eight different image generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, existing approaches that tokenize each modality independently face two critical limitations: (1) redundancy across modalities that reduces efficiency, and (2) failure to capture inter-modal interactions that limits item representation. We introduce FusID, a modality-fused semantic ID framework that addresses these limitations through three key components: (i) multimodal fusion that learns unified representations by jointly encoding information across modalities, (ii) representation learning that brings frequently co-occurring item embeddings closer while maintaining distinctiveness and preventing feature redundancy, and (iii) product quantization that converts the fused continuous embeddings into multiple discrete tokens to mitigate ID conflict. Evaluated on a multimodal next-song recommendation (i.e., playlist continuation) benchmark, FusID achieves zero ID conflicts, ensuring that each token sequence maps to exactly one song, mitigates codebook underutilization, and outperforms baselines in terms of MRR and Recall@k (k = 1, 5, 10, 20).</p></details> |  |

Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size, enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks, demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for the broader AI community.

Geometric Analysis of Emotion Representations via Hyperspherical Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06575v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Psychological research has long utilized circumplex models to structure emotions, placing similar emotions adjacently and opposing ones diagonally. Although frequently used to interpret deep learning representations, these models are rarely directly incorporated into the representation learning of language models, leaving their geometric validity unexplored. This paper proposes a method to induce circular emotion representations within language model embeddings via contrastive learning on a hypersphere. We show that while this circular alignment offers superior interpretability and robustness against dimensionality reduction, it underperforms compared to conventional designs in high-dimensional settings and fine-grained classification. Our findings elucidate the trade-offs involved in applying psychological circumplex models to deep learning architectures.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches typically employ contrastive learning, treating paired image-report samples as positives and unpaired ones as negatives. However, in medical datasets, there can be substantial similarities between images or reports from different patients. Rigidly treating all unpaired samples as negatives, can disrupt the underlying semantic structure and negatively impact the quality of the learned representations. In this paper, we propose a multi-level alignment framework, Representation Learning with Semantic-aware Instance and Sparse Token Alignments (SISTA) by exploiting the semantic correspondence between medical image and radiology reports at two levels, i.e., image-report and patch-word levels. Specifically, we improve the conventional contrastive learning by incorporating inter-report similarity to eliminate the false negatives and introduce a method to effectively align image patches with relevant word tokens. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving transfer performance across different datasets on three downstream tasks: image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. Notably, our framework achieves significant improvements in fine-grained tasks even with limited labeled data. Codes and pre-trained models will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review, 8 pages</p></details> |

Following this trend, we propose a novel approach that empowers off-the-shelf LMs to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNNs on node classification tasks, without requiring any architectural modification. By preserving the LM's original architecture, our approach retains a key benefit of LM instruction tuning: the ability to jointly train on diverse datasets, fostering greater flexibility and efficiency. To achieve this, we introduce two key augmentation strategies: (1) Enriching LMs' input using topological and semantic retrieval methods, which provide richer contextual information, and (2) guiding the LMs' classification process through a lightweight GNN classifier that effectively prunes class candidates. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that backbone Flan-T5 LMs equipped with these augmentation strategies outperform SOTA text-output node classifiers and are comparable to top-performing vector-output node classifiers. By bridging the gap between specialized node classifiers and general LMs, this work paves the way for more versatile and widely applicable graph learning models. We will open-source the code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods fail to consider all types of spatial and temporal interactions among agents and obstacles, leading to unsafe and inefficient robot paths. In this article, we leverage a graph-based representation of crowded and constrained scenarios and propose a structured framework to learn robot navigation policies with deep reinforcement learning. We first split the representations of different inputs and propose a heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph to model distinct interactions among humans, robots, and obstacles. Based on the heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph, we propose HEIGHT, a novel navigation policy network architecture with different components to capture heterogeneous interactions through space and time. HEIGHT utilizes attention mechanisms to prioritize important interactions and a recurrent network to track changes in the dynamic scene over time, encouraging the robot to avoid collisions adaptively. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that HEIGHT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of success, navigation time, and generalization to domain shifts in challenging navigation scenarios.

While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages with 3 figures and 2 tables, submitted to IEEE for a possible publication</p></details> |

However, this can cause overreliance on surface-level labels and impede cross-type knowledge transfer. We explore integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into HGNNs--a direction underexplored despite MoE's success in homogeneous settings. Crucially, we question the need for type-specific experts. We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics. Our work demonstrates that regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations--a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has been withdrawn by the authors due to significant revisions in preparation for conference submission.

Text2Structure3D is designed to support new intuitive ways of design exploration and iteration in the conceptual structural design process. The approach combines latent diffusion with a Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) and graph transformers to generate structural graphs that are close to an equilibrium state. Text2Structure3D integrates a residual force optimization post-processing step that ensures generated structures fully satisfy static equilibrium. The model was trained and validated using a cross-typological dataset of funicular form-found and statically determinate bridge structures, paired with text descriptions that capture the formal and structural features of each bridge. Results demonstrate that Text2Structure3D generates equilibrium structures with strong adherence to text-based specifications and greatly improves generalization capabilities compared to parametric model-based approaches. Text2Structure3D represents an early step toward a general-purpose foundation model for structural design, enabling the integration of generative AI into conceptual design workflows.</p></details> |  |

This issue is particularly critical in incomplete social networks, where sensitive attributes are frequently missing due to privacy and ethical restrictions. Existing solutions commonly generate these incomplete attributes, which may introduce additional biases and further compromise user privacy. To address this challenge, FairGE (Fair Graph Encoding) is introduced as a fairness-aware framework for GTs in incomplete social networks. Instead of generating sensitive attributes, FairGE encodes fairness directly through spectral graph theory. By leveraging the principal eigenvector to represent structural information and padding incomplete sensitive attributes with zeros to maintain independence, FairGE ensures fairness without data reconstruction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the method suppresses the influence of non-principal spectral components, thereby enhancing fairness. Extensive experiments on seven real-world social network datasets confirm that FairGE achieves at least a 16% improvement in both statistical parity and equality of opportunity compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The source code is shown in https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairGE.</p></details> | 12 pages, WWW 2026 |

However, existing methods may overlook the structural contextual information within each modality, making them vulnerable to interference from shallow features. To address these challenges, we propose MyGram, a modality-aware graph transformer with global distribution for multi-modal entity alignment. Specifically, we develop a modality diffusion learning module to capture deep structural contextual information within modalities and enable fine-grained multi-modal fusion. In addition, we introduce a Gram Loss that acts as a regularization constraint by minimizing the volume of a 4-dimensional parallelotope formed by multi-modal features, thereby achieving global distribution consistency across modalities.

| **[Learning from Brain Topography: A Hierarchical Local-Global Graph-Transformer Network for EEG Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10525v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how local neurophysiological patterns interact with global brain dynamics is essential for decoding human emotions from EEG signals. However, existing deep learning approaches often overlook the brain's intrinsic spatial organization, failing to simultaneously capture local topological relations and global dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose Neuro-HGLN, a Neurologically-informed Hierarchical Graph-Transformer Learning Network that integrates biologically grounded priors with hierarchical representation learning. Neuro-HGLN first constructs a spatial Euclidean prior graph based on physical electrode distances to serve as an anatomically grounded inductive bias. A learnable global dynamic graph is then introduced to model functional connectivity across the entire brain. In parallel, to capture fine-grained regional dependencies, Neuro-HGLN builds region-level local graphs using a multi-head self-attention mechanism. These graphs are processed synchronously through local-constrained parallel GCN layers to produce region-specific representations. Subsequently, an iTransformer encoder aggregates these features to capture cross-region dependencies under a dimension-as-token formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neuro-HGLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, providing enhanced interpretability grounded in neurophysiological structure. These results highlight the efficacy of unifying local topological learning with cross-region dependency modeling for robust EEG emotion recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Positional Encodings for GNNs and Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12732v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positional Encodings (PEs) are essential for injecting structural information into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Graph Transformers, yet their empirical impact remains insufficiently understood. We introduce a unified benchmarking framework that decouples PEs from architectural choices, enabling a fair comparison across 8 GNN and Transformer models, 9 PEs, and 10 synthetic and real-world datasets. Across more than 500 model-PE-dataset configurations, we find that commonly used expressiveness proxies, including Weisfeiler-Lehman distinguishability, do not reliably predict downstream performance. In particular, highly expressive PEs frequently fail to improve, and can even degrade performance on real-world tasks. At the same time, we identify several simple and previously overlooked model-PE combinations that match or outperform recent state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate the strong task-dependence of PEs and underscore the need for empirical validation beyond theoretical expressiveness. To support reproducible research, we release an open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating PEs for graph learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at KDD 2026 Datasets & Benchmarks Track</p></details> |
| **[Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08251v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In heterogeneous graphs, we can observe complex structures such as tree-like or hierarchical structures. Recently, the hyperbolic space has been widely adopted in many studies to effectively learn these complex structures. Although these methods have demonstrated the advantages of the hyperbolic space in learning heterogeneous graphs, most existing methods still have several challenges. They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of HypHGT, and the results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification task, with significantly reduced training time and memory usage.</p></details> | 14pages, 9 figures |
| **[UBiGTLoc: A Unified BiLSTM-Graph Transformer Localization Framework for IoT Sensor Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10743v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensor nodes localization in wireless Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks is crucial for the effective operation of diverse applications, such as smart cities and smart agriculture. Existing sensor nodes localization approaches heavily rely on anchor nodes within wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Anchor nodes are sensor nodes equipped with global positioning system (GPS) receivers and thus, have known locations. These anchor nodes operate as references to localize other sensor nodes. However, the presence of anchor nodes may not always be feasible in real-world IoT scenarios. Additionally, localization accuracy can be compromised by fluctuations in Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), particularly under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. To address these challenges, we propose UBiGTLoc, a Unified Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-Graph Transformer Localization framework. The proposed UBiGTLoc framework effectively localizes sensor nodes in both anchor-free and anchor-presence WSNs. The framework leverages BiLSTM networks to capture temporal variations in RSSI data and employs Graph Transformer layers to model spatial relationships between sensor nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that UBiGTLoc consistently outperforms existing methods and provides robust localization across both dense and sparse WSNs while relying solely on cost-effective RSSI data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and published in IEEE Internet of Things Journal</p></details> |
| **[Database Views as Explanations for Relational Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09482v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash, Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case of hetero-GNNs, and develop a model-specific approach via the notion of learnable masks. For comparison, we propose model-agnostic heuristic baselines and show that our approach is both more efficient and achieves better explanation quality in most cases. Our extensive empirical evaluation on the RelBench collection across diverse domains and record-level tasks demonstrates both the usefulness of our explanations and the efficiency of their generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology-Informed Graph Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02005v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have revolutionized performance in Natural Language Processing and Vision, paving the way for their integration with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). One key challenge in enhancing graph transformers is strengthening the discriminative power of distinguishing isomorphisms of graphs, which plays a crucial role in boosting their predictive performances. To address this challenge, we introduce 'Topology-Informed Graph Transformer (TIGT)', a novel transformer enhancing both discriminative power in detecting graph isomorphisms and the overall performance of Graph Transformers. TIGT consists of four components: A topological positional embedding layer using non-isomorphic universal covers based on cyclic subgraphs of graphs to ensure unique graph representation: A dual-path message-passing layer to explicitly encode topological characteristics throughout the encoder layers: A global attention mechanism: And a graph information layer to recalibrate channel-wise graph features for better feature representation. TIGT outperforms previous Graph Transformers in classifying synthetic dataset aimed at distinguishing isomorphism classes of graphs. Additionally, mathematical analysis and empirical evaluations highlight our model's competitive edge over state-of-the-art Graph Transformers across various benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Geometry-grounded Representation Learning and Generative Modeling Workshop (GRaM) at ICML 2024</p></details> |

The workshops took place in Koblenz, Germany on June 10 as part of STAF (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). Graphs are common mathematical structures that are visual and intuitive. They constitute a natural and seamless way for system modeling in science, engineering, and beyond, including computer science, biology, and business process modeling. Graph computation models constitute a class of very high-level models where graphs are first-class citizens. The aim of the International GCM Workshop series is to bring together researchers interested in all aspects of computation models based on graphs and graph transformation. It promotes the cross-fertilizing exchange of ideas and experiences among senior and young researchers from the different communities interested in the foundations, applications, and implementations of graph computation models and related areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sentient: Detecting APTs Via Capturing Indirect Dependencies and Behavioral Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06521v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are difficult to detect due to their complexity and stealthiness. To mitigate such attacks, many approaches model entities and their relationship using provenance graphs to detect the stealthy and persistent characteristics of APTs. However, existing detection methods suffer from the flaws of missing indirect dependencies, noisy complex scenarios, and missing behavioral logical associations, which make it difficult to detect complex scenarios and effectively identify stealthy threats. In this paper, we propose Sentient, an APT detection method that combines pre-training and intent analysis. It employs a graph transformer to learn structural and semantic information from provenance graphs to avoid missing indirect dependencies. We mitigate scenario noise by combining global and local information. Additionally, we design an Intent Analysis Module (IAM) to associate logical relationships between behaviors. Sentient is trained solely on easily obtainable benign data to detect malicious behaviors that deviate from benign behavioral patterns. We evaluated Sentient on three widely-used datasets covering real-world attacks and simulated attacks. Notably, compared to six state-of-the-art methods, Sentient achieved an average reduction of 44% in false positive rate(FPR) for detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Error Mitigation with Attention Graph Transformers for Burgers Equation Solvers on NISQ Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23817v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework augmented with learned error mitigation for solving the viscous Burgers equation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone. We discuss extensions of this approach to higher-dimensional Burgers systems and more general quantum partial differential equation solvers, highlighting learned error mitigation as a promising complement to physics-based noise reduction techniques on NISQ devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[QE-Catalytic: A Graph-Language Multimodal Base Model for Relaxed-Energy Prediction in Catalytic Adsorption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20084v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adsorption energy is a key descriptor of catalytic reactivity. It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa. To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[A hybrid global local computational framework for ship hull structural analysis using homogenized model and graph neural network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20020v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a computational framework for global local structural analysis of ship hull girders that integrates an equivalent single layer (ESL) model with a graph neural network (GNN). A coarse mesh homogenized ESL model efficiently predicts the global displacement field, from which degrees of freedom (DOFs) along stiffened panel boundaries are extracted. A global to local DOF mapping and reconstruction procedure is developed to recover detailed boundary kinematics for local analysis. The reconstructed DOFs, together with panel geometry and loading, serve as inputs to a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT), a subtype of GNN, which rapidly and accurately predicts the detailed stress and displacement fields for any panel within the hull girder. The HGT is trained using high fidelity 3D panel finite element model with reconstructed boundary conditions, enabling it to generalize across varying panel geometries, loadings, and boundary behaviors. Once trained, the framework requires only the global ESL solution in order to generate detailed local responses, making it highly suitable for optimization. Validation on three box beam case studies demonstrates that the global prediction error is governed by the coarse mesh ESL solution, while the HGT maintains high local accuracy and clearly outperforms conventional ESL based stress estimation method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fraud Detection Through Large-Scale Graph Clustering with Heterogeneous Link Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19061v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative fraud, where multiple fraudulent accounts coordinate to exploit online payment systems, poses significant challenges due to the formation of complex network structures. Traditional detection methods that rely solely on high-confidence identity links suffer from limited coverage, while approaches using all available linkages often result in fragmented graphs with reduced clustering effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based fraud detection framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale heterogeneous graph clustering through a principled link transformation approach. Our method distinguishes between \emph{hard links} (high-confidence identity relationships such as phone numbers, credit cards, and national IDs) and \emph{soft links} (behavioral associations including device fingerprints, cookies, and IP addresses). We introduce a graph transformation technique that first identifies connected components via hard links, merges them into super-nodes, and then reconstructs a weighted soft-link graph amenable to efficient embedding and clustering. The transformed graph is processed using LINE (Large-scale Information Network Embedding) for representation learning, followed by HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for density-based cluster discovery. Experiments on a real-world payment platform dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant graph size reduction (from 25 million to 7.7 million nodes), doubles the detection coverage compared to hard-link-only baselines, and maintains high precision across identified fraud clusters. Our framework provides a scalable and practical solution for industrial-scale fraud detection systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

The synergy between transformers and graph learning demonstrates strong performance and versatility across various graph-related tasks. This survey provides an in-depth review of recent progress and challenges in graph transformer research. We begin with foundational concepts of graphs and transformers. We then explore design perspectives of graph transformers, focusing on how they integrate graph inductive biases and graph attention mechanisms into the transformer architecture. Furthermore, we propose a taxonomy classifying graph transformers based on depth, scalability, and pre-training strategies, summarizing key principles for effective development of graph transformer models. Beyond technical analysis, we discuss the applications of graph transformer models for node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks, exploring their potential in other application scenarios as well. Finally, we identify remaining challenges in the field, such as scalability and efficiency, generalization and robustness, interpretability and explainability, dynamic and complex graphs, as well as data quality and diversity, charting future directions for graph transformer research.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |
| **[TAG-HGT: A Scalable and Cost-Effective Framework for Inductive Cold-Start Academic Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02381v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive cold-start recommendation remains the "Achilles' Heel" of industrial academic platforms, where thousands of new scholars join daily without historical interaction records. While recent Generative Graph Models (e.g., HiGPT, OFA) demonstrate promising semantic capabilities, their prohibitive inference latency (often exceeding 13 minutes per 1,000 requests) and massive computational costs render them practically undeployable for real-time, million-scale applications. To bridge this gap between generative quality and industrial scalability, we propose TAG-HGT, a cost-effective neuro-symbolic framework. Adopting a decoupled "Semantics-First, Structure-Refined" paradigm, TAG-HGT utilizes a frozen Large Language Model (DeepSeek-V3) as an offline semantic factory and distills its knowledge into a lightweight Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via Cross-View Contrastive Learning (CVCL). We present a key insight: while LLM semantics provide necessary global recall, structural signals offer the critical local discrimination needed to distinguish valid collaborators from semantically similar but socially unreachable strangers in dense embedding spaces. Validated under a strict Time-Machine Protocol on the massive OpenAlex dataset, TAG-HGT achieves a SOTA System Recall@10 of 91.97%, outperforming structure-only baselines by 20.7%. Most significantly, from an industrial perspective, TAG-HGT reduces inference latency by five orders of magnitude ($4.5 \times 10^{5}\times$) compared to generative baselines (from 780s down to 1.73 ms), and slashes inference costs from $\sim$$1.50 to $<$$0.001 per 1k queries. This 99.9% cost reduction democratizes high-precision academic recommendation.</p></details> | 8pages |
| **[Scaling Text2SQL via LLM-efficient Schema Filtering with Functional Dependency Graph Rerankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16083v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most modern Text2SQL systems prompt large language models (LLMs) with entire schemas -- mostly column information -- alongside the user's question. While effective on small databases, this approach fails on real-world schemas that exceed LLM context limits, even for commercial models. The recent Spider 2.0 benchmark exemplifies this with hundreds of tables and tens of thousands of columns, where existing systems often break. Current mitigations either rely on costly multi-step prompting pipelines or filter columns by ranking them against user's question independently, ignoring inter-column structure. To scale existing systems, we introduce \toolname, an open-source, LLM-efficient schema filtering framework that compacts Text2SQL prompts by (i) ranking columns with a query-aware LLM encoder enriched with values and metadata, (ii) reranking inter-connected columns via a lightweight graph transformer over functional dependencies, and (iii) selecting a connectivity-preserving sub-schema with a Steiner-tree heuristic. Experiments on real datasets show that \toolname achieves near-perfect recall and higher precision than CodeS, SchemaExP, Qwen rerankers, and embedding retrievers, while maintaining sub-second median latency and scaling to schemas with 23,000+ columns.

| **[ParaFormer: A Generalized PageRank Graph Transformer for Graph Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14619v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a promising graph learning tool, leveraging their all-pair connected property to effectively capture global information. To address the over-smoothing problem in deep GNNs, global attention was initially introduced, eliminating the necessity for using deep GNNs. However, through empirical and theoretical analysis, we verify that the introduced global attention exhibits severe over-smoothing, causing node representations to become indistinguishable due to its inherent low-pass filtering. This effect is even stronger than that observed in GNNs. To mitigate this, we propose PageRank Transformer (ParaFormer), which features a PageRank-enhanced attention module designed to mimic the behavior of deep Transformers. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that ParaFormer mitigates over-smoothing by functioning as an adaptive-pass filter. Experiments show that ParaFormer achieves consistent performance improvements across both node classification and graph classification tasks on 11 datasets ranging from thousands to millions of nodes, validating its efficacy. The supplementary material, including code and appendix, can be found in https://github.com/chaohaoyuan/ParaFormer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WSDM 2026</p></details> |

However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.</p></details> |  |

These models extend traditional message-passing GNNs and Transformers by representing node and edge features as spherical tensors that transform under irreducible representations of the rotation group SO(3), ensuring that predictions change in physically meaningful ways under rotations of the input. This guide develops a complete, intuitive foundation for spherical equivariant modeling - from group representations and spherical harmonics, to tensor products, Clebsch-Gordan decomposition, and the construction of SO(3)-equivariant kernels. Building on this foundation, we construct the Tensor Field Network and SE(3)-Transformer architectures and explain how they perform equivariant message-passing and attention on geometric graphs. Through clear mathematical derivations and annotated code excerpts, this guide serves as a self-contained introduction for researchers and learners seeking to understand or implement spherical EGNNs for applications in chemistry, molecular property prediction, protein structure modeling, and generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a technical version of the article originally published in Alchemy Bio (99 pages, 46 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Taint Analysis for Graph APIs Focusing on Broken Access Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08947v4)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis for Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes of the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether a tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use Critical Pair Analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the Critical Pair Analysis is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final preprint (revision #3) for submission to ICGT 24 Special Issue in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Node-Level Graph Domain Adaptation by Alleviating Local Dependency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13149v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in machine learning methods on graphs. However, transferring knowledge effectively from one graph to another remains a critical challenge. This highlights the need for algorithms capable of applying information extracted from a source graph to an unlabeled target graph, a task known as unsupervised graph domain adaptation (GDA). One key difficulty in unsupervised GDA is conditional shift, which hinders transferability. In this paper, we show that conditional shift can be observed only if there exists local dependencies among node features. To support this claim, we perform a rigorous analysis and also further provide generalization bounds of GDA when dependent node features are modeled using markov chains. Guided by the theoretical findings, we propose to improve GDA by decorrelating node features, which can be specifically implemented through decorrelated GCN layers and graph transformer layers. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing not only substantial performance enhancements over baseline GDA methods but also clear visualizations of small intra-class distances in the learned representations.

This paper introduces a practical, two-stage solution that balances deep graph representation with low-latency incremental updates. Our framework combines HetSGFormer, a scalable graph transformer for static learning, with Incremental Locally Linear Embedding (ILLE), a lightweight, CPU-based algorithm for real-time updates. HetSGFormer captures global structure with linear scalability, while ILLE provides rapid, targeted updates to incorporate new data, thus avoiding costly full retraining. This dual approach is cold-start resilient, leveraging the graph to create meaningful embeddings from sparse data. On billion-scale graphs, A/B tests show HetSGFormer achieved up to a 6.11% lift in Advertiser Value over previous methods, while the ILLE module added another 3.22% lift and improved embedding refresh timeliness by 83.2%. Our work provides a validated framework for deploying dynamic graph learning in production environments.</p></details> |  |

Using CEEMDAN, we extract nine IMFs spanning high-frequency fluctuations to long-term trends. Each IMF is transformed into a graph using four time-series-to-graph methods: natural visibility, horizontal visibility, recurrence, and transition graphs. Topological analysis shows clear scale-dependent structure: high-frequency IMFs yield dense, highly connected small-world graphs, whereas low-frequency IMFs produce sparser networks with longer characteristic path lengths.

We present PROTON, a heterogeneous graph transformer that generates testable hypotheses across molecular, organoid, and clinical systems. To evaluate PROTON, we apply it to Parkinson's disease (PD), bipolar disorder (BD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In PD, PROTON linked genetic risk loci to genes essential for dopaminergic neuron survival and predicted pesticides toxic to patient-derived neurons, including the insecticide endosulfan, which ranked within the top 1.29% of predictions. In silico screens performed by PROTON reproduced six genome-wide $α$-synuclein experiments, including a split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system (normalized enrichment score [NES] = 2.30, FDR-adjusted $p < 1 \times 10^{-4}$), an ascorbate peroxidase proximity labeling assay (NES = 2.16, FDR $< 1 \times 10^{-4}$), and a high-depth targeted exome sequencing study in 496 synucleinopathy patients (NES = 2.13, FDR $< 1 \times 10^{-4}$). In BD, PROTON predicted calcitriol as a candidate drug that reversed proteomic alterations observed in cortical organoids derived from BD patients. In AD, we evaluated PROTON predictions in health records from $n = 610,524$ patients at Mass General Brigham, confirming that five PROTON-predicted drugs were associated with reduced seven-year dementia risk (minimum hazard ratio = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.53-0.75, $p < 1 \times 10^{-7}$). PROTON generated neurological hypotheses that were evaluated across molecular, organoid, and clinical systems, defining a path for AI-driven discovery in neurological disease.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEIST: A Graph Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics and Proteomics Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11152v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics have become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and gene expression at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.</p></details> |  |

However, the design of scalable and topology-aware node tokenization has lagged behind other modalities. This gap becomes critical as the quadratic complexity of full attention renders them impractical on large-scale graphs. Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as brain-inspired models, provided an energy-saving scheme to convert input intensity into discrete spike-based representations through event-driven spiking neurons. Inspired by these characteristics, we propose a linear-time Graph Transformer with Spiking Node Tokenization (GT-SNT) for node classification. By integrating multi-step feature propagation with SNNs, spiking node tokenization generates compact, locality-aware spike count embeddings as node tokens to avoid predefined codebooks and their utilization issues. The codebook guided self-attention leverages these tokens to perform node-to-token attention for linear-time global context aggregation. In experiments, we compare GT-SNT with other state-of-the-art baselines on node classification datasets ranging from small to large. Experimental results show that GT-SNT achieves comparable performances on most datasets and reaches up to 130x faster inference speed compared to other GTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026; Code is available at https://github.com/Zhhuizhe/GT-SNT</p></details> |

While deep learning offers promising alternatives, existing methods often struggle with flexibility and generalization, particularly on unstructured meshes, which significantly limits their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose PhysGTO, an efficient Graph-Transformer Operator for learning physical dynamics through explicit manifold embeddings in both physical and latent spaces. In the physical space, the proposed Unified Graph Embedding module aligns node-level conditions and constructs sparse yet structure-preserving graph connectivity to process heterogeneous inputs. In the latent space, PhysGTO integrates a lightweight flux-oriented message-passing scheme with projection-inspired attention to capture local and global dependencies, facilitating multilevel interactions among complex physical correlations. This design ensures linear complexity relative to the number of mesh points, reducing both the number of trainable parameters and computational costs in terms of floating-point operations (FLOPs), and thereby allowing efficient inference in real-time applications. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning eleven datasets, covering problems with unstructured meshes, transient flow dynamics, and large-scale 3D geometries. PhysGTO consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs, demonstrating superior flexibility, scalability, and generalization in a wide range of simulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/pengwei07/PhysGTO</p></details> |
| **[Rule-Based Graph Programs Matching the Time Complexity of Imperative Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09144v3)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on recent advances in rule-based graph programming, which allow us to match the time complexity of some fundamental imperative graph algorithms. In general, achieving the time complexity of graph algorithms implemented in conventional languages using a rule-based graph-transformation language is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be implemented in the graph programming language GP 2 such that their runtime matches the time complexity of imperative implementations. However, this required input graphs to have a bounded node degree and (for some algorithms) to be connected. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies: the first program checks whether input graphs are connected, the second program checks whether input graphs are acyclic, and the third program solves the single-source shortest-paths problem for graphs with integer edge-weights. The first two programs run in linear time on (possibly disconnected) input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. The third program runs in time $O(nm)$ on arbitrary input graphs, matching the time complexity of imperative implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. For each program, we formally prove its correctness and time complexity, and provide runtime experiments on various graph classes.</p></details> | LMCS |
| **[A Network Science Approach to Granular Time Series Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17640v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series segmentation (TSS) is one of the time series (TS) analysis techniques, that has received considerably less attention compared to other TS related tasks. In recent years, deep learning architectures have been introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of various TS-to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d) demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the required training data compared to the baseline methods.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Graph Deep Learning for Intracranial Aneurysm Blood Flow Simulation and Risk Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09013v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intracranial aneurysms remain a major cause of neurological morbidity and mortality worldwide, where rupture risk is tightly coupled to local hemodynamics particularly wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index. Conventional computational fluid dynamics simulations provide accurate insights but are prohibitively slow and require specialized expertise. Clinical imaging alternatives such as 4D Flow MRI offer direct in-vivo measurements, yet their spatial resolution remains insufficient to capture the fine-scale shear patterns that drive endothelial remodeling and rupture risk while being extremely impractical and expensive. We present a graph neural network surrogate model that bridges this gap by reproducing full-field hemodynamics directly from vascular geometries in less than one minute per cardiac cycle. Trained on a comprehensive dataset of high-fidelity simulations of patient-specific aneurysms, our architecture combines graph transformers with autoregressive predictions to accurately simulate blood flow, wall shear stress, and oscillatory shear index. The model generalizes across unseen patient geometries and inflow conditions without mesh-specific calibration. Beyond accelerating simulation, our framework establishes the foundation for clinically interpretable hemodynamic prediction. By enabling near real-time inference integrated with existing imaging pipelines, it allows direct comparison with hospital phase-diagram assessments and extends them with physically grounded, high-resolution flow fields. This work transforms high-fidelity simulations from an expert-only research tool into a deployable, data-driven decision support system. Our full pipeline delivers high-resolution hemodynamic predictions within minutes of patient imaging, without requiring computational specialists, marking a step-change toward real-time, bedside aneurysm analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards agent-based-model informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05764v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we present a framework for designing neural networks that remain consistent with the underlying principles of agent-based models. We begin by highlighting the limitations of standard neural differential equations in modeling complex systems, where physical invariants (like energy) are often absent but other constraints (like mass conservation, information locality, bounded rationality) must be enforced. To address this, we introduce Agent-Based-Model informed Neural Networks (ABM-NNs), which leverage restricted graph neural networks and hierarchical decomposition to learn interpretable, structure-preserving dynamics. We validate the framework across three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a generalized Generalized Lotka--Volterra system, where we recover ground-truth parameters from short trajectories in presence of interventions; (ii) a graph-based SIR contagion model, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning baselines (GCN, GraphSAGE, Graph Transformer) in out-of-sample forecasting and noise robustness; and (iii) a real-world macroeconomic model of the ten largest economies, where we learn coupled GDP dynamics from empirical data and demonstrate counterfactual analysis for policy interventions</p></details> |  |
| **[Using weakest application conditions to rank graph transformations for graph repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08788v5)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When using graphs and graph transformations to model systems, consistency is an important concern. While consistency has primarily been viewed as a binary property, i.e., a graph is consistent or inconsistent with respect to a set of constraints, recent work has presented an approach to consistency as a graduated property. This allows living with inconsistencies for a while and repairing them when necessary. For repairing inconsistencies in a graph, we use graph transformation rules with so-called {\em impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions} to understand how much repair gain certain rule applications would bring. Both types of conditions can be derived from given graph constraints. Our main theorem shows that the difference between the number of actual constraint violations before and after a graph transformation step can be characterised by the difference between the numbers of violated impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions. This theory forms the basis for algorithms with look-ahead that rank graph transformations according to their potential for graph repair. An evaluation shows that graph repair can be well-supported by rules with these new types of application conditions in terms of effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 25 Figures, new, more efficient method for constructing application conditions, theoretical comparison to other concepts of consistency, extended evaluation</p></details> |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning on Molecular Graphs: A Systematic Investigation of Masking Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07064v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) plays a central role in molecular representation learning. Yet, many recent innovations in masking-based pretraining are introduced as heuristics and lack principled evaluation, obscuring which design choices are genuinely effective. This work cast the entire pretrain-finetune workflow into a unified probabilistic framework, enabling a transparent comparison and deeper understanding of masking strategies. Building on this formalism, we conduct a controlled study of three core design dimensions: masking distribution, prediction target, and encoder architecture, under rigorously controlled settings. We further employ information-theoretic measures to assess the informativeness of pretraining signals and connect them to empirically benchmarked downstream performance. Our findings reveal a surprising insight: sophisticated masking distributions offer no consistent benefit over uniform sampling for common node-level prediction tasks. Instead, the choice of prediction target and its synergy with the encoder architecture are far more critical. Specifically, shifting to semantically richer targets yields substantial downstream improvements, particularly when paired with expressive Graph Transformer encoders. These insights offer practical guidance for developing more effective SSL methods for molecular graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMAGT: Unveiling miRNA-Drug Associations by Integrating SMILES and RNA Sequence Structures through Graph Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05287v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MiRNAs, due to their role in gene regulation, have paved a new pathway for pharmacology, focusing on drug development that targets miRNAs. However, traditional wet lab experiments are limited by efficiency and cost constraints, making it difficult to extensively explore potential associations between developed drugs and target miRNAs. Therefore, we have designed a novel machine learning model based on a multi-layer transformer-based graph neural network, DMAGT, specifically for predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. This model transforms drug-miRNA associations into graphs, employs Word2Vec for embedding features of drug molecular structures and miRNA base structures, and leverages a graph transformer model to learn from embedded features and relational structures, ultimately predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. To evaluate DMAGT, we tested its performance on three datasets composed of drug-miRNA associations: ncDR, RNAInter, and SM2miR, achieving up to AUC of $95.24\pm0.05$. DMAGT demonstrated superior performance in comparative experiments tackling similar challenges. To validate its practical efficacy, we specifically focused on two drugs, namely 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin. Of the 20 potential drug-miRNA associations identified as the most likely, 14 were successfully validated. The above experiments demonstrate that DMAGT has an excellent performance and stability in predicting drug-miRNA associations, providing a new shortcut for miRNA drug development.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT): Fast and Accurate Molecular Generation via High-Fidelity Discrete Latents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02667v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The de novo generation of molecules with desirable properties is a critical challenge, where diffusion models are computationally intensive and autoregressive models struggle with error propagation. In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence. With its superior performance, efficiency, and architectural novelty, GVT not only presents a compelling alternative to diffusion models but also establishes a strong new baseline for the field, paving the way for future research in discrete latent-space molecular generation.</p></details> |  |

However, fully utilizing the multi-domain characteristics of EEG signals remains a significant challenge. Traditional single-perspective analyses often fail to capture the complex interplay of temporal, frequency, and spatial dimensions in EEG data. To address this, we introduce a multi-view graph transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations that integrates information across three domains: temporal dynamics from continuous series, frequency features extracted from frequency bands, and inter-channel relationships captured through several spatial encodings. This comprehensive approach allows model to capture the nuanced properties inherent in EEG signals, enhancing its flexibility and representational power. Evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrates that MVGT surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance. The results highlight its ability to extract multi-domain information and effectively model inter-channel relationships, showcasing its potential for EEG-based emotion recognition tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICONIP 2025 (Oral). 16 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Recent progress in deep learning has introduced increasingly sophisticated architectures for capturing relational dependencies within graph-structured data. In this work, we propose the Generalized Graph Transformer Variational Autoencoder (GGT-VAE). Our model integrates Generalized Graph Transformer Architecture with Variational Autoencoder framework for link prediction. Unlike prior GraphVAE, GCN, or GNN approaches, GGT-VAE leverages transformer style global self-attention mechanism along with laplacian positional encoding to model structural patterns across nodes into a latent space without relying on message passing. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GGT-VAE consistently achieves above-baseline performance in terms of ROC-AUC and Average Precision. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to explore graph structure generation using a generalized graph transformer backbone in a variational framework.</p></details> |  |

To identify and stop cyber threats, efficient data collection methods are necessary. This research presents an innovative method to cloud security by integrating numerous data sources and modalities with multi-modal deep learning autoencoders. The Multi-Modal Deep Learning Ensemble Architecture (MMDLEA), a unique approach for anomaly detection and classification in multi-modal data, is proposed in this study. The proposed design integrates the best features of six deep learning models: Multi-Modal Deep Learning Autoencoder (MMDLA), Anomaly Detection using Adaptive Metric Learning (ADAM), ADADELTA, ADAGRAD, RMSPROP, and Stacked Graph Transformer (SGT). A final prediction is produced by combining the outputs of all the models, each of which is trained using a distinct modality of the data. Based on the test dataset, the recommended MMDLA architecture achieves an accuracy of 98.5% and an F1-score of 0.985, demonstrating its superior performance over each individual model. Of the different models, the ADAM model performs the best, with an accuracy of 96.2% and an F1-score of 0.962. With an F1-score of 0.955 and an accuracy of 95.5%, the ADADELTA model trails closely behind. MMDLA obtains an F1-score of 0.948 and an accuracy of 94.8%. Additionally, the suggested MMDLEA design exhibits enhanced resilience to fluctuating modalities and noisy data, proving its usefulness in practical settings. Future study in this area is made possible by the results, which show the potential of the proposed framework for abnormal identification and categorization in multi-modal data.</p></details> | 13 pages |

This limitation has led some researchers to advocate Graph Transformers as a better alternative, whereas others suggest that it can be mitigated within the MPNN framework, using virtual nodes or other rewiring techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that oversquashing is not limited to long-range tasks, but can also arise in short-range problems. This observation allows us to disentangle two distinct mechanisms underlying oversquashing: (1) the bottleneck phenomenon, which can arise even in low-range settings, and (2) the vanishing gradient phenomenon, which is closely associated with long-range tasks. We further show that the short-range bottleneck effect is not captured by existing explanations for oversquashing, and that adding virtual nodes does not resolve it. In contrast, transformers do succeed in such tasks, positioning them as the more compelling solution to oversquashing, compared to specialized MPNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Learning on Graphs (LoG) 2025.

However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.</p></details> | 14 pages.

We present Agint, an agentic graph compiler, interpreter, and runtime that incrementally and hierarchically converts natural-language instructions into typed, effect-aware code DAGs. Agint introduces explicit type floors (text to data to spec to code) grounded in semantic graph transformations and a hybrid LLM and function-based JIT runtime. This enables dynamic graph refinement, reproducible and optimizable execution, speculative evaluation, and interoperability with existing developer tools. Agint's typed graph bindings improve reliability and allow concurrent composition of concurrent codebases by construction, supporting accelerated development with smaller and faster models, lower latency, efficient context utilization, and higher throughput. Hierarchical compilation allows scalable graph edits, while the graph structure supports reproducibility and efficient parallel generation. Agint provides a composable unix-style toolchain: dagify (DAG compiler), dagent (hybrid JIT runtime), schemagin (schema generator), and datagin (data transformer) for realtime, low-latency code and dataflow creation. Human developers and coding agents refine graphs through the Agint CLI, while non-technical users use Agint Flow GUI for visual editing, conversational refinement, and debugging to promote prototype agentic workflows to production code. This continuous co-creation model allows teams to prototype quickly, refine seamlessly, and deploy reliably, bridging natural language, compiler methods, and developer tooling to enable a new generation of composable, team-centric coding agents at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, NeurIPS 2025: Deep Learning for Code in the Agentic Era</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we introduce GRIT-LP, a graph transformer explicitly designed for polar ice-layer thickness estimation from polar radar imagery. Accurately estimating ice layer thickness is critical for understanding snow accumulation, reconstructing past climate patterns and reducing uncertainties in projections of future ice sheet evolution and sea level rise. GRIT-LP combines an inductive geometric graph learning framework with self-attention mechanism, and introduces two major innovations that jointly address challenges in modeling the spatio-temporal patterns of ice layers: a partitioned spatial graph construction strategy that forms overlapping, fully connected local neighborhoods to preserve spatial coherence and suppress noise from irrelevant long-range links, and a long-range skip connection mechanism within the transformer that improves information flow and mitigates oversmoothing in deeper attention layers. We conducted extensive experiments, demonstrating that GRIT-LP outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with a 24.92\% improvement in root mean squared error. These results highlight the effectiveness of graph transformers in modeling spatiotemporal patterns by capturing both localized structural features and long-range dependencies across internal ice layers, and demonstrate their potential to advance data-driven understanding of cryospheric processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[PDDFormer: Pairwise Distance Distribution Graph Transformer for Crystal Material Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12984v5)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crystal structures can be simplified as a periodic point set that repeats across three-dimensional space along an underlying lattice. Traditionally, crystal representation methods characterize the structure using descriptors such as lattice parameters, symmetry, and space groups. However, in reality, atoms in materials always vibrate above absolute zero, causing their positions to fluctuate continuously. This dynamic behavior disrupts the fundamental periodicity of the lattice, making crystal graphs based on static lattice parameters and conventional descriptors discontinuous under slight perturbations. Chemists proposed the pairwise distance distribution (PDD) method to address this problem. However, the completeness of PDD requires defining a large number of neighboring atoms, leading to high computational costs. Additionally, PDD does not account for atomic information, making it challenging to apply it directly to crystal material property prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the atom-Weighted Pairwise Distance Distribution (WPDD) and Unit cell Pairwise Distance Distribution (UPDD) and apply them to the construction of multi-edge crystal graphs. We demonstrate the continuity and general completeness of crystal graphs under slight atomic position perturbations. Moreover, by modeling PDD as global information and integrating it into matrix-based message passing, we significantly reduce computational costs. Comprehensive evaluation results show that WPDDFormer achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across tasks on benchmark datasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS-DFT.</p></details> | 15pages,8 figures |
| **[Mesh-based Super-resolution of Detonation Flows with Multiscale Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12041v3)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Super-resolution flow reconstruction using state-of-the-art data-driven techniques is valuable for a variety of applications, such as subgrid/subfilter closure modeling, accelerating spatiotemporal forecasting, data compression, and serving as an upscaling tool for sparse experimental measurements. In the present work, a first-of-its-kind multiscale graph transformer approach is developed for mesh-based super-resolution (SR-GT) of reacting flows. The novel data-driven modeling paradigm leverages a graph-based flow-field representation compatible with complex geometries and non-uniform/unstructured grids. Further, the transformer backbone captures long-range dependencies between different parts of the low-resolution flow-field, identifies important features, and then generates the super-resolved flow-field that preserves those features at a higher resolution. The performance of SR-GT is demonstrated in the context of spectral-element-discretized meshes for a challenging test problem of 2D detonation propagation within a premixed hydrogen-air mixture exhibiting highly complex multiscale reacting flow behavior. The SR-GT framework utilizes a unique element + neighborhood graph representation for the coarse input, which is then tokenized before being processed by the transformer component to produce the fine output. It is demonstrated that SR-GT provides high super-resolution accuracy for reacting flow-field features and superior performance compared to traditional interpolation-based SR schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient LLM-aware Heterogeneous Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17923v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs are widely present in real-world complex networks, where the diversity of node and relation types leads to complex and rich semantics. Efforts for modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs are restricted by the limitations of predefined semantic dependencies and the scarcity of supervised signals. The advanced pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm leverages graph structure to provide rich self-supervised signals, but introduces semantic gaps between tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential to address the semantic issues of relations and tasks in heterogeneous graphs through their strong reasoning capabilities in textual modality, but their incorporation into heterogeneous graphs is largely limited by computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Efficient LLM-Aware (ELLA) framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the above issues. To capture complex relation semantics, we propose an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer that leverages LLM to encode multi-hop, multi-type relations. To reduce computational complexity, we further employ a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer, which help reduces the complexity of LLM-aware relation reasoning from exponential to linear. To bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we introduce the fine-grained task-aware textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Extensive experiments on four heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed ELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the performance and efficiency. In particular, ELLA scales up to 13b-parameter LLMs and achieves up to a 4x speedup compared with existing LLM-based methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/l-wd/ELLA.</p></details> |  |

Today, ZX-calculus, a computing model for quantum circuit transformation, is attracting attention for its highly abstract graph-based approach. Whereas existing tools such as PyZX and Quantomatic offer domain-specific support for quantum circuit optimization, visualization and theorem-proving, we present a complementary approach using LMNtal, a general-purpose hierarchical graph rewriting language, to establish a diagrammatic transformation and verification platform with model checking. Our methodology shows three advantages: (1) manipulation of ZX-diagrams through native graph transformation rules, enabling direct implementation of basic rules; (2) quantified pattern matching via QLMNtal extensions, greatly simplifying rule specification; and (3) interactive visualization and validation of optimization paths through state space exploration. Through case studies, we demonstrate how our framework helps understand optimization paths and design new algorithms and strategies. This suggests that the declarative language LMNtal and its toolchain could serve as a new platform to investigate quantum circuit transformation from a different perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 27 figures.

| **[BrainHGT: A Hierarchical Graph Transformer for Interpretable Brain Network Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17604v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformer shows remarkable potential in brain network analysis due to its ability to model graph structures and complex node relationships. Most existing methods typically model the brain as a flat network, ignoring its modular structure, and their attention mechanisms treat all brain region connections equally, ignoring distance-related node connection patterns. However, brain information processing is a hierarchical process that involves local and long-range interactions between brain regions, interactions between regions and sub-functional modules, and interactions among functional modules themselves. This hierarchical interaction mechanism enables the brain to efficiently integrate local computations and global information flow, supporting the execution of complex cognitive functions. To address this issue, we propose BrainHGT, a hierarchical Graph Transformer that simulates the brain's natural information processing from local regions to global communities. Specifically, we design a novel long-short range attention encoder that utilizes parallel pathways to handle dense local interactions and sparse long-range connections, thereby effectively alleviating the over-globalizing issue. To further capture the brain's modular architecture, we designe a prior-guided clustering module that utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to group brain regions into functional communities and leverage neuroanatomical prior to guide the clustering process, thereby improving the biological plausibility and interpretability. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method significantly improves performance of disease identification, and can reliably capture the sub-functional modules of the brain, demonstrating its interpretability.</p></details> |  |

First, they typically rely on assumptions leading to decay properties of local agent interactions, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies such as cascading power failures or epidemic outbreaks. Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures. Further, to improve credit assignment during training, STACCA integrates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator that is compatible with state-value critic estimates. We evaluate STACCA on epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks, demonstrating improved performance, network generalization, and scalability. These results highlight the potential of transformer-based MARL architectures to achieve scalable and generalizable control in large-scale networked systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted for review</p></details> |

Efficient Long-Range Message Passing with Fractal Nodes in MPNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13010v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, but often struggle to balance local and global information. While graph Transformers aim to address this by enabling long-range interactions, they often overlook the inherent locality and efficiency of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). We propose a new concept called fractal nodes, inspired by the fractal structure observed in real-world networks. Our approach is based on the intuition that graph partitioning naturally induces fractal structure, where subgraphs often reflect the connectivity patterns of the full graph. Fractal nodes are designed to coexist with the original nodes and adaptively aggregate subgraph-level feature representations, thereby enforcing feature similarity within each subgraph. We show that fractal nodes alleviate the over-squashing problem by providing direct shortcut connections that enable long-range propagation of subgraph-level representations. Experiment results show that our method improves the expressive power of MPNNs and achieves comparable or better performance to graph Transformers while maintaining the computational efficiency of MPNN by improving the long-range dependencies of MPNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026 for Oral Representation.

| **[Hierarchical Frequency-Decomposition Graph Neural Networks for Road Network Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12507v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road networks are critical infrastructures underpinning intelligent transportation systems and their related applications. Effective representation learning of road networks remains challenging due to the complex interplay between spatial structures and frequency characteristics in traffic patterns. Existing graph neural networks for modeling road networks predominantly fall into two paradigms: spatial-based methods that capture local topology but tend to over-smooth representations, and spectral-based methods that analyze global frequency components but often overlook localized variations. This spatial-spectral misalignment limits their modeling capacity for road networks exhibiting both coarse global trends and fine-grained local fluctuations. To bridge this gap, we propose HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical frequency-decomposition graph neural network that unifies spatial and spectral modeling. HiFiNet constructs a multi-level hierarchy of virtual nodes to enable localized frequency analysis, and employs a decomposition-updating-reconstruction framework with a topology-aware graph transformer to separately model and fuse low- and high-frequency signals. Theoretically justified and empirically validated on multiple real-world datasets across four downstream tasks, HiFiNet demonstrates superior performance and generalization ability in capturing effective road network representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Aware Retrieval Augmentation for Dynamic Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12495v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic recommendation systems aim to provide personalized suggestions by modeling temporal user-item interactions across time-series behavioral data. Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained dynamic graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn user-item representations over temporal snapshot graphs. However, fine-tuning GNNs on these graphs often results in generalization issues due to temporal discrepancies between pre-training and fine-tuning stages, limiting the model's ability to capture evolving user preferences. To address this, we propose TarDGR, a task-aware retrieval-augmented framework designed to enhance generalization capability by incorporating task-aware model and retrieval-augmentation. Specifically, TarDGR introduces a Task-Aware Evaluation Mechanism to identify semantically relevant historical subgraphs, enabling the construction of task-specific datasets without manual labeling. It also presents a Graph Transformer-based Task-Aware Model that integrates semantic and structural encodings to assess subgraph relevance. During inference, TarDGR retrieves and fuses task-aware subgraphs with the query subgraph, enriching its representation and mitigating temporal generalization issues. Experiments on multiple large-scale dynamic graph datasets demonstrate that TarDGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with extensive empirical evidence underscoring its superior accuracy and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[Understanding and Estimating the Execution Time of Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15631v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the scarcity of quantum computing resources, researchers and developers have very limited access to real quantum computers. Therefore, judicious planning and utilization of quantum computer runtime are essential to ensure smooth execution and completion of projects. Accurate estimation of a quantum circuit's execution time is thus necessary to prevent unexpectedly exceeding the anticipated runtime or the maximum capacity of the quantum computers; it also allows quantum computing platforms to make precisely informed provisioning and prioritization of quantum computing jobs. In this paper, we first study the characteristics of quantum circuits' runtime on simulators and real quantum computers. Then, we introduce an innovative method that employs a graph transformer-based model, utilizing the graph information and global information of quantum circuits to estimate their execution time. We selected a benchmark dataset comprising over 1,510 quantum circuits, initially predicting their execution times on simulators, which yielded promising results with an R-squared value greater than 95%. Subsequently, we applied active learning to select 340 circuit samples with a confidence level of 95% to build and evaluate our approach for the estimation of circuit execution times on quantum computers, achieving an average R-squared value exceeding 90%. Our approach can be integrated into quantum computing platforms to provide an accurate estimation of quantum execution time and be used as a reference for prioritizing quantum execution jobs. In addition, our findings provide insights for quantum program developers to optimize their circuits for reduced execution time.</p></details> |  |
| **[MP-GFormer: A 3D-Geometry-Aware Dynamic Graph Transformer Approach for Machining Process Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11837v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machining process planning (MP) is inherently complex due to structural and geometrical dependencies among part features and machining operations. A key challenge lies in capturing dynamic interdependencies that evolve with distinct part geometries as operations are performed. Machine learning has been applied to address challenges in MP, such as operation selection and machining sequence prediction. Dynamic graph learning (DGL) has been widely used to model dynamic systems, thanks to its ability to integrate spatio-temporal relationships. However, in MP, while existing DGL approaches can capture these dependencies, they fail to incorporate three-dimensional (3D) geometric information of parts and thus lack domain awareness in predicting machining operation sequences. To address this limitation, we propose MP-GFormer, a 3D-geometry-aware dynamic graph transformer that integrates evolving 3D geometric representations into DGL through an attention mechanism to predict machining operation sequences. Our approach leverages StereoLithography surface meshes representing the 3D geometry of a part after each machining operation, with the boundary representation method used for the initial 3D designs. We evaluate MP-GFormer on a synthesized dataset and demonstrate that the method achieves improvements of 24\% and 36\% in accuracy for main and sub-operation predictions, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[NTSFormer: A Self-Teaching Graph Transformer for Multimodal Isolated Cold-Start Node Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04870v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Isolated cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because such nodes have no edges and often have missing modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for isolated cold-start inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However, this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student" prediction based only on self information (i.e., the node's own features), and a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature data into token sequences, which are then processed by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion. Experiments on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior performance for multimodal isolated cold-start node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We introduce Solvaformer, a geometry-aware graph transformer that models solutions as multiple molecules with independent SE(3) symmetries. The architecture combines intramolecular SE(3)-equivariant attention with intermolecular scalar attention, enabling cross-molecular communication without imposing spurious relative geometry. We train Solvaformer in a multi-task setting to predict both solubility (log S) and solvation free energy, using an alternating-batch regimen that trains on quantum-mechanical data (CombiSolv-QM) and on experimental measurements (BigSolDB 2.0). Solvaformer attains the strongest overall performance among the learned models and approaches a DFT-assisted gradient-boosting baseline, while outperforming an EquiformerV2 ablation and sequence-based alternatives. In addition, token-level attention produces chemically coherent attributions: case studies recover known intra- vs. inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding patterns that govern solubility differences in positional isomers. Taken together, Solvaformer provides an accurate, scalable, and interpretable approach to solution-phase property prediction by uniting geometric inductive bias with a mixed dataset training strategy on complementary computational and experimental data.</p></details> |  |

Public benchmarks remain significantly smaller and hand-crafted, while releasing truly malicious RTL raises ethical and operational risks. This work presents an automated and scalable methodology for generating HT-like patterns in industry-scale netlists whose purpose is to stress-test detection tools without altering user-visible functionality. The pipeline (i) parses large gate-level designs into connectivity graphs, (ii) explores rare regions using SCOAP testability metrics, and (iii) applies parameterized, function-preserving graph transformations to synthesize trigger-payload pairs that mimic the statistical footprint of stealthy HTs. When evaluated on the benchmarks generated in this work, representative state-of-the-art graph-learning models fail to detect Trojans. The framework closes the evaluation gap between academic circuits and modern SoCs by providing reproducible challenge instances that advance security research without sharing step-by-step attack instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in DATE 2026</p></details> |

Existing expressivity results are often tied to specific design choices and lack comprehensive empirical validation on large-scale data. This leaves a gap between theory and practice, preventing generalizable insights that exceed particular application domains. Here, we propose the Generalized-Distance Transformer (GDT), a GT architecture using standard attention that incorporates many advancements for GTs from recent years, and develop a fine-grained understanding of the GDT's representation power in terms of attention and PEs. Through extensive experiments, we identify design choices that consistently perform well across various applications, tasks, and model scales, demonstrating strong performance in a few-shot transfer setting without fine-tuning. Our evaluation covers over eight million graphs with roughly 270M tokens across diverse domains, including image-based object detection, molecular property prediction, code summarization, and out-of-distribution algorithmic reasoning. We distill our theoretical and practical findings into several generalizable insights about effective GT design, training, and inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 as spotlight</p></details> |
| **[QAGT-MLP: An Attention-Based Graph Transformer for Small and Large-Scale Quantum Error Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03119v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Noisy quantum devices demand error-mitigation techniques to be accurate yet simple and efficient in terms of number of shots and processing time. Many established approaches (e.g., extrapolation and quasi-probability cancellation) impose substantial execution or calibration overheads, while existing learning-based methods have difficulty scaling to large and deep circuits. In this research, we introduce QAGT-MLP: an attention-based graph transformer tailored for small- and large-scale quantum error mitigation (QEM). QAGT-MLP encodes each quantum circuit as a graph whose nodes represent gate instances and whose edges capture qubit connectivity and causal adjacency. A dual-path attention module extracts features around measured qubits at two scales or contexts: 1) graph-wide global structural context; and 2) fine-grained local lightcone context. These learned representations are concatenated with circuit-level descriptor features and the circuit noisy expected values, then they are passed to a lightweight MLP to predict the noise-mitigated values. On large-scale 100-qubit Trotterized 1D Transverse-Field Ising Models -- TFIM circuits -- the proposed QAGT-MLP outperformed state-of-the-art learning baselines in terms of mean error and error variability, demonstrating strong validity and applicability in real-world QEM scenarios under matched shot budgets. By using attention to fuse global structures with local lightcone neighborhoods, QAGT-MLP achieves high mitigation quality without the increasing noise scaling or resource demand required by classical QEM pipelines, while still offering a scalable and practical path to QEM in modern and future quantum workloads.</p></details> |  |

It helps extract features from embedded vectors by adding global information and its expressivity has been proved to be powerful. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity restricts its practicability. Although several researches have provided attention mechanism in sparse form, they are lack of theoretical analysis about the expressivity of their mechanism while reducing complexity. In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity. Other than this, it can be implemented in parallel on a new dimension, which contributes to much memory saving. (2) Random Batch Attention mechanism can improve most of the existing models by replacing their attention mechanisms, even many previously improved attention mechanisms. (3) Random Batch Attention mechanism has theoretical explanation in convergence, as it comes from Random Batch Methods on computation mathematics. Experiments on large graphs have proved advantages mentioned above. Also, the theoretical modeling of self-attention mechanism is a new tool for future research on attention-mechanism analysis.</p></details> |  |

This non-invasive method has gained traction across diverse domains, including telemedicine, affective computing, driver fatigue detection, and health monitoring, owing to its scalability and convenience. Despite significant progress in remote physiological signal measurement, a crucial characteristic - the intrinsic periodicity - has often been underexplored or insufficiently modeled in previous approaches, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose Reperio-rPPG, a novel framework that strategically integrates Relational Convolutional Networks with a Graph Transformer to effectively capture the periodic structure inherent in physiological signals. Additionally, recognizing the limited diversity of existing rPPG datasets, we further introduce a tailored CutMix augmentation to enhance the model's generalizability. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used benchmark datasets - PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD - demonstrate that Reperio-rPPG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits remarkable robustness under various motion (e.g., stationary, rotation, talking, walking) and illumination conditions (e.g., nature, low LED, high LED).

While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2) transformer representations refine GNN message passing through attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with 6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling, with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein representations through learnable diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Temporal and Structural Context in Graph Transformers for Relational Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04557v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction. To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.</p></details> |  |

Here, we estimated this unified graph representation and enabled generation of dense functional brain graphs through a graph transformer autoencoder with latent diffusion, with spectral geometry providing an inductive bias to guide learning. This geometry-aware latent representation, although unsupervised, meaningfully separated working-memory states and decoded visual stimuli, with performance further enhanced by incorporating neural dynamics.

Extending graph pre-trained models to web-scale graphs with billions of nodes in industrial scenarios, while avoiding negative transfer across graphs or tasks, remains a challenge. We aim to develop a general graph pre-trained model with inductive ability that can make predictions for unseen new nodes and even new graphs. In this work, we introduce a scalable transformer-based graph pre-training framework called PGT (Pre-trained Graph Transformer). Based on the masked autoencoder architecture, we design two pre-training tasks: one for reconstructing node features and the other for reconstructing local structures. Unlike the original autoencoder architecture where the pre-trained decoder is discarded, we propose a novel strategy that utilizes the decoder for feature augmentation. Our framework, tested on the publicly available ogbn-papers100M dataset with 111 million nodes and 1.6 billion edges, achieves state-of-the-art performance, showcasing scalability and efficiency.

Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, ICRA 2025</p></details> |

The key challenge is predicting user purchasing behavior from the available data. Current recommendation models prioritize extracting multimodal information while neglecting the distinction between redundant and valuable data. They also rely heavily on a single semantic framework (e.g., local or global semantics), resulting in an incomplete or biased representation of user preferences, particularly those less expressed in prior interactions. Furthermore, these approaches fail to capture the complex interactions between users and items, limiting the model's ability to meet diverse users. To address these challenges, we present SRGFormer, a structurally optimized multimodal recommendation model. By modifying the transformer for better integration into our model, we capture the overall behavior patterns of users. Then, we enhance structural information by embedding multimodal information into a hypergraph structure to aid in learning the local structures between users and items. Meanwhile, applying self-supervised tasks to user-item collaborative signals enhances the integration of multimodal information, thereby revealing the representational features inherent to the data's modality. Extensive experiments on three public datasets reveal that SRGFormer surpasses previous benchmark models, achieving an average performance improvement of 4.47 percent on the Sports dataset. The code is publicly available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia 2025</p></details> |
| **[Can Classic GNNs Be Strong Baselines for Graph-level Tasks? Simple Architectures Meet Excellence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09263v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often criticized for their limited expressiveness, issues like over-smoothing and over-squashing, and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies. Conversely, Graph Transformers (GTs) are regarded as superior due to their employment of global attention mechanisms, which potentially mitigate these challenges. Literature frequently suggests that GTs outperform GNNs in graph-level tasks, especially for graph classification and regression on small molecular graphs. In this study, we explore the untapped potential of GNNs through an enhanced framework, GNN+, which integrates six widely used techniques: edge feature integration, normalization, dropout, residual connections, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding, to effectively tackle graph-level tasks. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of three classic GNNs (GCN, GIN, and GatedGCN) enhanced by the GNN+ framework across 14 well-known graph-level datasets. Our results reveal that, contrary to prevailing beliefs, these classic GNNs consistently match or surpass the performance of GTs, securing top-three rankings across all datasets and achieving first place in eight. Furthermore, they demonstrate greater efficiency, running several times faster than GTs on many datasets. This highlights the potential of simple GNN architectures, challenging the notion that complex mechanisms in GTs are essential for superior graph-level performance.

Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter. Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers need not choose between performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

While code plagiarism detection systems used in education practice are resilient against basic obfuscation, they struggle against structural modifications that preserve program behavior, especially caused by refactoring-based obfuscation. This paper presents a novel and extensible framework that enhances state-of-the-art detectors by leveraging code property graphs and graph transformations to counteract refactoring-based obfuscation. Our comprehensive evaluation of real-world student submissions, obfuscated using both algorithmic and AI-based obfuscation attacks, demonstrates a significant improvement in detecting plagiarized code.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published at ICSE'26. 13 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

Although Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are widely used for financial fraud detection, graph Transformer models such as Graph-BERT are gaining prominence due to their Transformer-based architecture, which mitigates issues such as over-smoothing. Graph-BERT is designed for static graphs and primarily evaluated on citation networks with undirected edges. However, financial transaction networks are inherently dynamic, with evolving structures and directed edges representing the flow of money. To address these challenges, we introduce DynBERG, a novel architecture that integrates Graph-BERT with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer to capture temporal evolution over multiple time steps. Additionally, we modify the underlying algorithm to support directed edges, making DynBERG well-suited for dynamic financial transaction analysis. We evaluate our model on the Elliptic dataset, which includes Bitcoin transactions, including all transactions during a major cryptocurrency market event, the Dark Market Shutdown. By assessing DynBERG's resilience before and after this event, we analyse its ability to adapt to significant market shifts that impact transaction behaviours. Our model is benchmarked against state-of-the-art dynamic graph classification approaches, such as EvolveGCN and GCN, demonstrating superior performance, outperforming EvolveGCN before the market shutdown and surpassing GCN after the event. Additionally, an ablation study highlights the critical role of incorporating a time-series deep learning component, showcasing the effectiveness of GRU in modelling the temporal dynamics of financial transactions.</p></details> |  |

An NLP-based Framework for Trajectory Analysis using Graph Transformer Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23905v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies group target trajectory intent as the outcome of a cooperative game where the complex-spatio trajectories are modeled using an NLP-based generative model. In our framework, the group intent is specified by the characteristic function of a cooperative game, and allocations for players in the cooperative game are specified by either the core, the Shapley value, or the nucleolus. The resulting allocations induce probability distributions that govern the coordinated spatio-temporal trajectories of the targets that reflect the group's underlying intent. We address two key questions: (1) How can the intent of a group trajectory be optimally formalized as the characteristic function of a cooperative game? (2) How can such intent be inferred from noisy observations of the targets? To answer the first question, we introduce a Fisher-information-based characteristic function of the cooperative game, which yields probability distributions that generate coordinated spatio-temporal patterns. As a generative model for these patterns, we develop an NLP-based generative model built on formal grammar, enabling the creation of realistic multi-target trajectory data. To answer the second question, we train a Graph Transformer Neural Network (GTNN) to infer group trajectory intent-expressed as the characteristic function of the cooperative game-from observational data with high accuracy. The self-attention function of the GTNN depends on the track estimates. Thus, the formulation and algorithms provide a multi-layer approach that spans target tracking (Bayesian signal processing) and the GTNN (for group intent inference).</p></details> |  |
| **[FoGE: Fock Space inspired encoding for graph prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02937v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based structures effortlessly.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective cross-lingual generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Found...</summary><p>Found some issues and need to correct them</p></details> |

However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Return of ChebNet: Understanding and Improving an Overlooked GNN on Long Range Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07624v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ChebNet, one of the earliest spectral GNNs, has largely been overshadowed by Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), which gained popularity for their simplicity and effectiveness in capturing local graph structure. Despite their success, MPNNs are limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies between nodes. This has led researchers to adapt MPNNs through rewiring or make use of Graph Transformers, which compromises the computational efficiency that characterized early spatial message-passing architectures, and typically disregards the graph structure. Almost a decade after its original introduction, we revisit ChebNet to shed light on its ability to model distant node interactions. We find that out-of-box, ChebNet already shows competitive advantages relative to classical MPNNs and GTs on long-range benchmarks, while maintaining good scalability properties for high-order polynomials. However, we uncover that this polynomial expansion leads ChebNet to an unstable regime during training. To address this limitation, we cast ChebNet as a stable and non-dissipative dynamical system, which we coin Stable-ChebNet. Our Stable-ChebNet model allows for stable information propagation, and has controllable dynamics which do not require the use of eigendecompositions, positional encodings, or graph rewiring. Across several benchmarks, Stable-ChebNet achieves near state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

While effective, rewiring inherently alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks. Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information. To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our unified framework and model design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 (Poster)</p></details> |

The deep learning models can be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws. Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of 3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN) significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution. It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables.

The general chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT) significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes. Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference in industrial drug discovery workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphTARIF: Linear Graph Transformer with Augmented Rank and Improved Focus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10631v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However, existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map. Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG) framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics. To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more generalizable and robust neural representations.</p></details> |  |

A Unified Empirical Study on Atomistic Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05583v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN - that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model development.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 8 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |

Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city road networks. This dataset features graphs with over 100k nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs based on local node eccentricities, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement-particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution-which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.</p></details> | work in progress |

Pluggable type systems are difficult to deploy in legacy codebases because they require programmers to write type annotations manually. This paper investigates how to use machine learning to infer type qualifiers automatically. We propose a novel representation, NaP-AST, that encodes minimal dataflow hints for the effective inference of type qualifiers. We evaluate several model architectures for inferring type qualifiers, including Graph Transformer Network, Graph Convolutional Network and Large Language Model. We further validated these models by applying them to 12 open-source programs from a prior evaluation of the NullAway pluggable typechecker, lowering warnings in all but one unannotated project. We discovered that GTN shows the best performance, with a recall of .89 and precision of 0.6. Furthermore, we conduct a study to estimate the number of Java classes needed for good performance of the trained model. For our feasibility study, performance improved around 16k classes, and deteriorated due to overfitting around 22k classes.</p></details> |  |

We propose a heterogeneous graph representation of stiffened panels that accounts for geometrical variability, non-uniform boundary conditions, and diverse loading scenarios, using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The structure is partitioned into multiple structural units, such as stiffeners and the plates between them, with each unit represented by three distinct node types: geometry, boundary, and loading nodes. Edge heterogeneity is introduced by incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting nodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees of heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are implemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises stress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and degrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams composed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The heterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart, demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, an ablation analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of graph heterogeneity on HGT performance. The results show strong predictive accuracy for both displacement and von Mises stress, effectively capturing structural behavior patterns and maximum values.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint and has been submitted to Engineering with Computers</p></details> |

These reviews pose significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets, a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era.

By enabling users to query databases through natural language rather than SQL, this technology significantly lowers the barrier to data analysis. However, generating accurate SQL from natural language remains challenging due to ambiguity in user queries, the complexity of schema linking, limited generalization across SQL dialects, and the need for domain-specific understanding. In this study, we propose a Single-Agent Self-Refinement with Ensemble Voting (SSEV) pipeline built on PET-SQL that operates without ground-truth data, integrating self-refinement with Weighted Majority Voting (WMV) and its randomized variant (RWMA). Experimental results show that the SSEV achieves competitive performance across multiple benchmarks, attaining execution accuracies of 85.5% on Spider 1.0-Dev, 86.4% on Spider 1.0-Test, and 66.3% on BIRD-Dev. Building on insights from the SSEV pipeline, we further propose ReCAPAgent-SQL (Refinement-Critique-Act-Plan agent-based SQL framework) to address the growing complexity of enterprise databases and real-world Text-to-SQL tasks. The framework integrates multiple specialized agents for planning, external knowledge retrieval, critique, action generation, self-refinement, schema linking, and result validation, enabling iterative refinement of SQL predictions through agent collaboration. ReCAPAgent-SQL's WMA results achieve 31% execution accuracy on the first 100 queries of Spider 2.0-Lite, demonstrating significant improvements in handling real-world enterprise scenarios. Overall, our work facilitates the deployment of scalable Text-to-SQL systems in practical settings, supporting better data-driven decision-making at lower cost and with greater efficiency.</p></details> | 29 pages, 22 figures |

| **[Think Locally, Explain Globally: Graph-Guided LLM Investigations via Local Reasoning and Belief Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17915v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM agents excel when environments are mostly static and the needed information fits in a model's context window, but they often fail in open-ended investigations where explanations must be constructed by iteratively mining evidence from massive, heterogeneous operational data. These investigations exhibit hidden dependency structure: entities interact, signals co-vary, and the importance of a fact may only become clear after other evidence is discovered. Because the context window is bounded, agents must summarize intermediate findings before their significance is known, increasing the risk of discarding key evidence. ReAct-style agents are especially brittle in this regime. Their retrieve-summarize-reason loop makes conclusions sensitive to exploration order and introduces run-to-run non-determinism, producing a reliability gap where Pass-at-k may be high but Majority-at-k remains low. Simply sampling more rollouts or generating longer reasoning traces does not reliably stabilize results, since hypotheses cannot be autonomously checked as new evidence arrives and there is no explicit mechanism for belief bookkeeping and revision. In addition, ReAct entangles semantic reasoning with controller duties such as tool orchestration and state tracking, so execution errors and plan drift degrade reasoning while consuming scarce context. We address these issues by formulating investigation as abductive reasoning over a dependency graph and proposing EoG (Explanations over Graphs), a disaggregated framework in which an LLM performs bounded local evidence mining and labeling (cause vs symptom) while a deterministic controller manages traversal, state, and belief propagation to compute a minimal explanatory frontier. On a representative ITBench diagnostics task, EoG improves both accuracy and run-to-run consistency over ReAct baselines, including a 7x average gain in Majority-at-k entity F1.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM for Large-Scale Optimization Model Auto-Formulation: Bridging Flexibility and Standardization via Agentic Workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09635v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale optimization is a key backbone of modern business decision-making. However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. The agentic workflow leverages common modeling practices to standardize the modeling process into a sequence of structured sub-tasks, offloading mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This reduces the LLM's burden in planning and data handling, allowing us to exploit its flexibility to address unstructured components. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios. Along the way, we introduce Large-Scale-OR and Air-NRM, the first comprehensive benchmarks for large-scale optimization auto-formulation. The code and data of this work is available at https://github.com/CoraLiang01/lean-llm-opt.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version of https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5329027</p></details> |
| **[dLLM-ASR: A Faster Diffusion LLM-based Framework for Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17902v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on large language models (LLMs) achieve superior performance by leveraging pretrained LLMs as decoders, but their token-by-token generation mechanism leads to inference latency that grows linearly with sequence length. Meanwhile, discrete diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling high-quality parallel sequence generation with pretrained decoders. However, directly applying native text-oriented dLLMs to ASR leads to a fundamental mismatch between open-ended text generation and the acoustically conditioned transcription paradigm required by ASR. As a result, it introduces unnecessary difficulty and computational redundancy, such as denoising from pure noise, inflexible generation lengths, and fixed denoising steps. We propose dLLM-ASR, an efficient dLLM-based ASR framework that formulates dLLM's decoding as a prior-guided and adaptive denoising process. It leverages an ASR prior to initialize the denoising process and provide an anchor for sequence length. Building upon this prior, length-adaptive pruning dynamically removes redundant tokens, while confidence-based denoising allows converged tokens to exit the denoising loop early, enabling token-level adaptive computation. Experiments demonstrate that dLLM-ASR achieves recognition accuracy comparable to autoregressive LLM-based ASR systems and delivers a 4.44$\times$ inference speedup, establishing a practical and efficient paradigm for ASR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Argument-Based Consistency in Toxicity Explanations of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19113v3)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about toxicity - from their explanations that justify a stance - to enhance their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Argument-based Consistency (ArC), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity explanations reflect an ideal and logical argumentation process. Based on uncertainty quantification, we develop six metrics for ArC to comprehensively evaluate the (in)consistencies in LLMs' toxicity explanations. We conduct several experiments on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and irrelevant responses. We open-source our code (https://github.com/uofthcdslab/ArC) and LLM-generated explanations (https://huggingface.co/collections/uofthcdslab/arc) for future works.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 7 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[UniCog: Uncovering Cognitive Abilities of LLMs through Latent Mind Space Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17897v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A growing body of research suggests that the cognitive processes of large language models (LLMs) differ fundamentally from those of humans. However, existing interpretability methods remain limited in explaining how cognitive abilities are engaged during LLM reasoning. In this paper, we propose UniCog, a unified framework that analyzes LLM cognition via a latent mind space. Formulated as a latent variable model, UniCog encodes diverse abilities from dense model activations into sparse, disentangled latent dimensions. Through extensive analysis on six advanced LLMs, including DeepSeek-V3.2 and GPT-4o, we reveal a Pareto principle of LLM cognition, where a shared reasoning core is complemented by ability-specific signatures. Furthermore, we discover that reasoning failures often manifest as anomalous intensity in latent activations. These findings opens a new paradigm in LLM analysis, providing a cognition grounded view of reasoning dynamics. Finally, leveraging these insights, we introduce a latent-informed candidate prioritization strategy, which improves reasoning performance by up to 7.5% across challenging benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/milksalute/unicog.</p></details> |  |
| **[TruthTensor: Evaluating LLMs through Human Imitation on Prediction Market under Drift and Holistic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13545v3)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating language models and AI agents remains fundamentally challenging because static benchmarks fail to capture real-world uncertainty, distribution shift, and the gap between isolated task accuracy and human-aligned decision-making under evolving conditions. This paper introduces TruthTensor, a novel, reproducible evaluation paradigm that measures reasoning models not only as prediction engines but as human-imitation systems operating in socially-grounded, high-entropy environments. Building on forward-looking, contamination-free tasks, our framework anchors evaluation to live prediction markets and combines probabilistic scoring to provide a holistic view of model behavior. TruthTensor complements traditional correctness metrics with drift-centric diagnostics and explicit robustness checks for reproducibility. It specify human vs. automated evaluation roles, annotation protocols, and statistical testing procedures to ensure interpretability and replicability of results. In experiments across 500+ real markets (political, economic, cultural, technological), TruthTensor demonstrates that models with similar forecast accuracy can diverge markedly in calibration, drift, and risk-sensitivity, underscoring the need to evaluate models along multiple axes (accuracy, calibration, narrative stability, cost, and resource efficiency). TruthTensor therefore operationalizes modern evaluation best practices, clear hypothesis framing, careful metric selection, transparent compute/cost reporting, human-in-the-loop validation, and open, versioned evaluation contracts, to produce defensible assessments of LLMs in real-world decision contexts. We publicly released TruthTensor at https://truthtensor.com.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Does LLM Focus on the Right Words? Mitigating Context Bias in LLM-based Recommenders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10978v3)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), owing to their extensive open-domain knowledge and semantic reasoning capabilities, have been increasingly integrated into recommender systems (RS). However, a substantial gap remains between the pre-training objectives of LLMs and the specific requirements of recommendation tasks. To address this gap, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly performed on specially curated recommendation datasets to further enhance their predictive ability. Despite its success, SFT exhibits a critical limitation: it induces Context Bias, whereby the model over-relies on auxiliary tokens, such as task descriptions and prefix-generated tokens, while underutilizing core user interaction tokens that encode user-specific preferences. This bias not only undermines recommendation accuracy but also raises unfairness concerns. To address this issue, we propose Group Distributionally Robust Optimization-based Tuning (GDRT), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that enforces consistent model performance across token groups with varying degrees of relevance to auxiliary tokens. By adaptively upweighting underperforming groups, typically those weakly correlated with auxiliary tokens, GDRT shifts the model's attention from superficial auxiliary cues to informative user interaction tokens, thereby mitigating context bias. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that GDRT effectively mitigates context bias, yielding substantial improvements in recommendation accuracy (with an average NDCG@10 gain of 24.29%) and significantly enhancing recommendation fairness. The code is available at https://github.com/WANGBohaO-jpg/GDRT.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW2026 |

Our approach reduces reliance on large-scale data and incorporates a robot-agnostic pipeline that embodies an LLM. Our framework, InteLiPlan, ensures that the LLM's decision-making capabilities are effectively aligned with robotic functions, enhancing operational robustness and adaptability, while our human-in-the-loop mechanism allows for real-time human intervention when user instruction is required. We evaluate our method in both simulation and on the real robot platforms, including a Toyota Human Support Robot and an ANYmal D robot with a Unitree Z1 arm. Our method achieves a 95% success rate in the `fetch me' task completion with failure recovery, highlighting its capability in both failure reasoning and task planning. InteLiPlan achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art LLM-based robotics planners, while using only real-time onboard computing.

Traditional intrusion detection systems designed for static ground-based networks prove inadequate for tackling the unique characteristics of aerial IoT environments, including frequent topology changes, real-time detection requirements, and energy limitations. In this article, we analyze the intrusion detection requirements for LAE-IoT networks, complemented by a comprehensive review of evaluation metrics that cover detection effectiveness, response time, and resource consumption. Then, we investigate transformative potential of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms and introduce a large language model (LLM)-enabled agentic AI framework for enhancing intrusion detection in LAE-IoT networks. This leads to our proposal of a novel multi-agent collaborative intrusion detection framework that leverages specialized LLM-enhanced agents for intelligent data processing and adaptive classification. Through experimental validation, our framework demonstrates superior performance of over 90\% classification accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets. These results highlight the transformative potential of combining agentic AI principles with LLMs for next-generation LAE-IoT security systems.</p></details> |  |

In practical deployments, workloads span lightweight OCR to complex multimodal reasoning; using one MLLM for all queries either over-provisions compute on easy instances or sacrifices accuracy on hard ones. Query-level model selection (routing) addresses this tension, but extending routing from text-only LLMs to MLLMs is nontrivial due to modality fusion, wide variation in computational cost across models, and the absence of a standardized, budget-aware evaluation. We present MMR-Bench, a unified benchmark that isolates the multimodal routing problem and enables comparison under fixed candidate sets and cost models. MMR-Bench provides (i) a controlled environment with modality-aware inputs and variable compute budgets, (ii) a broad suite of vision-language tasks covering OCR, general VQA, and multimodal math reasoning, and (iii) strong single-model reference, oracle upper bounds, and representative routing policies. Using MMR-Bench, we show that incorporating multimodal signals improves routing quality. Empirically, these cues improve the cost-accuracy frontier and enable the routed system to exceed the strongest single model's accuracy at roughly 33% of its cost. Furthermore, policies trained on a subset of models and tasks generalize zero-shot to new datasets and text-only benchmarks without retuning, establishing MMR-Bench as a foundation for studying adaptive multimodal model selection and efficient MLLM deployment. The code will be available at: https://github.com/Hunter-Wrynn/MMR-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering LLMs for Structure-Based Drug Design via Exploration-Augmented Latent Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15333v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong representation and reasoning capabilities, but their application to structure-based drug design (SBDD) is limited by insufficient understanding of protein structures and unpredictable molecular generation. To address these challenges, we propose Exploration-Augmented Latent Inference for LLMs (ELILLM), a framework that reinterprets the LLM generation process as an encoding, latent space exploration, and decoding workflow. ELILLM explicitly explores portions of the design problem beyond the model's current knowledge while using a decoding module to handle familiar regions, generating chemically valid and synthetically reasonable molecules. In our implementation, Bayesian optimization guides the systematic exploration of latent embeddings, and a position-aware surrogate model efficiently predicts binding affinity distributions to inform the search. Knowledge-guided decoding further reduces randomness and effectively imposes chemical validity constraints. We demonstrate ELILLM on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, showing strong controlled exploration and high binding affinity scores compared with seven baseline methods. These results demonstrate that ELILLM can effectively enhance LLMs capabilities for SBDD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Verification on Instruction Following of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17789v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental problem of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to important applications is that LLMs do not always follow instructions, and violations are often hard to observe or check. In LLM-based agentic workflows, such violations can propagate and amplify along reasoning chains, causing task failures and system incidents. This paper presents NSVIF, a neuro-symbolic framework for verifying whether an LLM's output follows the instructions used to prompt the LLM. NSVIF is a universal, general-purpose verifier; it makes no assumption about the instruction or the LLM. NSVIF formulates instruction-following verification as a constraint-satisfaction problem by modeling user instructions as constraints. NSVIF models both logical and semantic constraints; constraint solving is done by a unified solver that orchestrates logical reasoning and semantic analysis. To evaluate NSVIF, we develop VIFBENCH, a new benchmark for instruction-following verifiers with fine-grained data labels. Experiments show that NSVIF significantly outperforms LLM-based approaches and provides interpretable feedback. We also show that feedback from NSVIF helps improve LLMs' instruction-following capability without post-training.</p></details> |  |

This challenges design intent formulation, where designers must progressively refine understanding through exploration. Existing tools either sacrifice exploratory flexibility for structural stability or leave reasoning implicit, failing to support human-LLM alignment. Through a formative study with eight designers, we introduce curated reasoning-enabling designers to explicitly inspect, reorganize, and selectively regenerate LLM reasoning structures. We present DesignerlyLoop, implementing this through a two-layer structure separating design intent from LLM reasoning. A study with 20 designers demonstrates that curated reasoning significantly improves design quality and creativity. Our work contributes a novel interaction paradigm for human-LLM alignment, transforming LLMs from content generators into structured reasoning partners in creative design.</p></details> |  |

Creators often struggle to manage ambiguous intentions, emergent outputs, and complex code, limiting depth of exploration. This work examines how large language models (LLMs) can scaffold reflection not as isolated prompts, but as a system-level mechanism shaping creative regulation. From formative studies with eight expert creators, we derived reflection challenges and design principles that informed Reflexa, an integrated scaffold combining dialogic guidance, visualized version navigation, and iterative suggestion pathways. A within-subject study with 18 participants provides an exploratory mechanism validation, showing that structured reflection patterns mediate the link between AI interaction and creative outcomes. These reflection trajectories enhanced perceived controllability, broadened exploration, and improved originality and aesthetic quality. Our findings advance HCI understanding of reflection from LLM-assisted creative practices, and provide design strategies for building LLM-based creative tools that support richer human-AI co-creativity.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-42: Enabling Determinism in LLM Inference with Verified Speculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17768v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In LLM inference, the same prompt may yield different outputs across different runs. At the system level, this non-determinism arises from floating-point non-associativity combined with dynamic batching and GPU kernels whose reduction orders vary with batch size. A straightforward way to eliminate non-determinism is to disable dynamic batching during inference, but doing so severely degrades throughput. Another approach is to make kernels batch-invariant; however, this tightly couples determinism to kernel design, requiring new implementations. This coupling also imposes fixed runtime overheads, regardless of how much of the workload actually requires determinism. Inspired by ideas from speculative decoding, we present LLM-42, a scheduling-based approach to enable determinism in LLM inference. Our key observation is that if a sequence is in a consistent state, the next emitted token is likely to be consistent even with dynamic batching. Moreover, most GPU kernels use shape-consistent reductions. Leveraging these insights, LLM-42 decodes tokens using a non-deterministic fast path and enforces determinism via a lightweight verify-rollback loop. The verifier replays candidate tokens under a fixed-shape reduction schedule, commits those that are guaranteed to be consistent across runs, and rolls back those violating determinism. LLM-42 mostly re-uses existing kernels unchanged and incurs overhead only in proportion to the traffic that requires determinism.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/microsoft/llm-42</p></details> |
| **[The LLM Data Auditor: A Metric-oriented Survey on Quality and Trustworthiness in Evaluating Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17717v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating data across various modalities. By transforming data from a scarce resource into a controllable asset, LLMs mitigate the bottlenecks imposed by the acquisition costs of real-world data for model training, evaluation, and system iteration. However, ensuring the high quality of LLM-generated synthetic data remains a critical challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on generation methodologies, with limited direct attention to the quality of the resulting data. Furthermore, most studies are restricted to single modalities, lacking a unified perspective across different data types. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textbf{LLM Data Auditor framework}. In this framework, we first describe how LLMs are utilized to generate data across six distinct modalities. More importantly, we systematically categorize intrinsic metrics for evaluating synthetic data from two dimensions: quality and trustworthiness. This approach shifts the focus from extrinsic evaluation, which relies on downstream task performance, to the inherent properties of the data itself. Using this evaluation system, we analyze the experimental evaluations of representative generation methods for each modality and identify substantial deficiencies in current evaluation practices. Based on these findings, we offer concrete recommendations for the community to improve the evaluation of data generation. Finally, the framework outlines methodologies for the practical application of synthetic data across different modalities.</p></details> |  |

A Formal Information-Theoretic Analysis on Multi-Turn LLM Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17716v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but still struggle with a critical ability for LLM-based agents: asking good questions for resolving ambiguity in user requests. While prior work has explored information-seeking behavior through word games, existing benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that provide both final and intermediate signals based on Information Gain (IG). Moreover, they rarely provide systematic comparisons between models that use chain-of-thought reasoning and those that do not. We propose a multi-turn dialogue framework that quantitatively measures how effectively LLMs gather information through yes/no questions in a hierarchical knowledge graph environment. Our framework employs a triad of interacting LLM agents that ask questions, answer them, and update the hypothesis space. We adopt IG as the main metric, grounded in Shannon entropy, to assess query effectiveness at each turn and cumulatively. We instantiate our framework in a geographical Guess My City game setting organized in a five-level taxonomy and evaluate multiple LLM variants under fully and partially observable conditions, with and without Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that, among the evaluated models, the ones with explicit reasoning capabilities achieve higher IG per turn and reach solutions in fewer steps, particularly in partially observable settings. Analysis of reasoning traces reveals that smaller models compensate for limited capacity through more aggressive exploration of candidate questions, while larger models exhibit higher assertiveness in selecting optimal queries, generating candidates with greater potential IG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the NeusymBridge Workshop at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

To strengthen this alignment, recent works propose Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple audio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby promoting fine-grained discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness, ADC introduces a semantic gap between input audios-often rich in diverse events-and the brief, difference-focused short caption. This deviation from AC-style task causes a mismatch with the pretraining objective, leading to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably challenging but gentler alternative that guides the model to capture shared semantics across audio clips rather than detailed differences. Experiments show that ACC not only improves audio-text understanding on captioning benchmarks but also better preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music tasks, confirming its ability to enable more robust cross-modal understanding and achieve a better balance between generalization and task-specific performance in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce the distance-to-distance ratio (DDR), a novel measure of similarity between LLM sentence embeddings. Inspired by Lipschitz continuity, DDR measures the rate of change in similarity between the pre-context word embeddings and the similarity between post-context LLM embeddings, thus measuring the semantic influence of context. We evaluate the performance of DDR in experiments designed as a series of perturbations applied to sentences drawn from a sentence dataset. For each sentence, we generate variants by replacing one, two, or three words with either synonyms, which constitute semantically similar text, or randomly chosen words, which constitute semantically dissimilar text. We compare the performance of DDR with other prevailing similarity metrics and demonstrate that DDR consistently provides finer discrimination between semantically similar and dissimilar texts, even under minimal, controlled edits.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

These characteristics make it difficult for conventional retrieval-augmented generation pipelines to recover the statutory elements required for accurate retrieval. Dense retrievers focus primarily on the literal surface form of the query, whereas lightweight rerankers lack the legal-reasoning capacity needed to assess statutory applicability. We present LegalMALR, a retrieval framework that integrates a Multi-Agent Query Understanding System (MAS) with a zero-shot large-language-model-based reranking module (LLM Reranker). MAS generates diverse, legally grounded reformulations and conducts iterative dense retrieval to broaden candidate coverage. To stabilise the stochastic behaviour of LLM-generated rewrites, we optimise a unified MAS policy using Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization(GRPO). The accumulated candidate set is subsequently evaluated by the LLM Reranker, which performs natural-language legal reasoning to produce the final ranking. We further construct CSAID, a dataset of 118 difficult Chinese legal queries annotated with multiple statutory labels, and evaluate LegalMALR on both CSAID and the public STARD benchmark. Experiments show that LegalMALR substantially outperforms strong Retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) baselines in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining multi-perspective query interpretation, reinforcement-based policy optimisation, and large-model reranking for statute retrieval.</p></details> | 31pages, 4 figures |

Yet, these inputs rely on obtrusive explicit prompts. The advent of gaze tracking on smart devices offers a unique opportunity to extract implicit user intent for personalization. This paper investigates whether LLMs can interpret user gaze for text-based tasks. We evaluate different gaze representations for personalization and validate their effectiveness in realistic reading tasks. Results show that LLMs can leverage gaze to generate high-quality personalized summaries and support users in downstream tasks, highlighting the feasibility and value of gaze-driven personalization for future mobile and wearable LLM applications.</p></details> |  |

As Large Language Models (LLMs) develop, there is a rising consensus that psychology is essential for capturing human-like cognition, behavior, and interaction. This paper reviews how psychological theories can inform and enhance stages of LLM development. Our review integrates insights from six subfields of psychology, including cognitive, developmental, behavioral, social, personality psychology, and psycholinguistics. With stage-wise analysis, we highlight current trends and gaps in how psychological theories are applied. By examining both cross-domain connections and points of tension, we aim to bridge disciplinary divides and promote more thoughtful integration of psychology into NLP research.</p></details> |  |

Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), RLVR lets an LLM generate multiple candidate solutions and reinforces those that lead to a verifiably correct final answer. However, in practice, RLVR often requires thousands of training steps to reach strong performance, incurring substantial computation largely attributed to prolonged exploration. In this work, we make a surprising observation: during RLVR, LLMs evolve in a strongly linear manner. Specifically, both model weights and model output log-probabilities exhibit strong linear correlations with RL training steps. This suggests that RLVR predominantly amplifies trends that emerge early in training, rather than continuously discovering new behaviors throughout the entire optimization trajectory. Motivated by this linearity, we investigate whether future model states can be predicted from intermediate checkpoints via extrapolation, avoiding continued expensive training. We show that Weight Extrapolation produces models with performance comparable to standard RL training while requiring significantly less computation.

| **[Fast KVzip: Efficient and Accurate LLM Inference with Gated KV Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17668v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient key-value (KV) cache management is crucial for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs), yet existing compression techniques often incur a trade-off between performance degradation and computational overhead. We propose a novel gating-based KV cache eviction method for frozen-weight LLMs that achieves high compression ratios with negligible computational cost. Our approach introduces lightweight sink-attention gating modules to identify and retain critical KV pairs, and integrates seamlessly into both the prefill and decoding stages. The proposed gate training algorithm relies on forward passes of an LLM, avoiding expensive backpropagation, while achieving strong task generalization through a task-agnostic reconstruction objective. Extensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-1M, Qwen3, and Gemma3 families show that our method maintains near-lossless performance while evicting up to 70% of the KV cache. The results are consistent across a wide range of tasks, including long-context understanding, code comprehension, and mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the generality of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Silenced Biases: The Dark Side LLMs Learned to Refuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03369v3)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly widespread, especially in sensitive applications where fairness is essential and biased outputs can cause significant harm. However, evaluating the fairness of models is a complex challenge, and approaches that do so typically utilize standard question-answer (QA) styled schemes. Such methods often overlook deeper issues by interpreting the model's refusal responses as positive fairness measurements, which creates a false sense of fairness. In this work, we introduce the concept of silenced biases, which are unfair preferences encoded within models' latent space and are effectively concealed by safety-alignment. Previous approaches that considered similar indirect biases often relied on prompt manipulation or handcrafted implicit queries, which present limited scalability and risk contaminating the evaluation process with additional biases. We propose the Silenced Bias Benchmark (SBB), which aims to uncover these biases by employing activation steering to reduce model refusals during QA. SBB supports easy expansion to new demographic groups and subjects, presenting a fairness evaluation framework that encourages the future development of fair models and tools beyond the masking effects of alignment training. We demonstrate our approach over multiple LLMs, where our findings expose an alarming distinction between models' direct responses and their underlying fairness issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence - AI Alignment Track (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[The Landscape of Agentic Reinforcement Learning for LLMs: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02547v4)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous, decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL. Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on Transactions on Machine Learning Research: https://openreview.net/forum?id=RY19y2RI1O</p></details> |

Recent advancements in LLM-based UI generation have enabled efficient UI generation to assist the UI design process. We introduce AlignUI, a method that aligns LLM-generated UIs with user tasks and preferences by using a user preference dataset to guide the LLM's reasoning process. The dataset was crowdsourced from 50 general users (the target users of generated UIs) and contained 720 UI control preferences on eight image-editing tasks. We evaluated AlignUI by generating UIs for six unseen tasks and conducting a user study with 72 additional general users. The results showed that the generated UIs closely align with multiple dimensions of user preferences. We conclude by discussing the applicability of our method to support user-aligned UI design for multiple task domains and user groups, as well as personalized user needs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Aligned Enhancement of Programming Answers with LLMs Guided by User Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17604v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to support software developers in tasks such as code generation, optimization, and documentation. However, their ability to improve existing programming answers in a human-like manner remains underexplored. On technical question-and-answer platforms such as Stack Overflow (SO), contributors often revise answers based on user comments that identify errors, inefficiencies, or missing explanations. Yet roughly one-third of this feedback is never addressed due to limited time, expertise, or visibility, leaving many answers incomplete or outdated. This study investigates whether LLMs can enhance programming answers by interpreting and incorporating comment-based feedback. We make four main contributions. First, we introduce ReSOlve, a benchmark consisting of 790 SO answers with associated comment threads, annotated for improvement-related and general feedback. Second, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to identify actionable concerns, finding that DeepSeek achieves the best balance between precision and recall. Third, we present AUTOCOMBAT, an LLM-powered tool that improves programming answers by jointly leveraging user comments and question context. Compared to human revised references, AUTOCOMBAT produces near-human quality improvements while preserving the original intent and significantly outperforming the baseline. Finally, a user study with 58 practitioners shows strong practical value, with 84.5 percent indicating they would adopt or recommend the tool. Overall, AUTOCOMBAT demonstrates the potential of scalable, feedback-driven answer refinement to improve the reliability and trustworthiness of technical knowledge platforms.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this study, we introduce \textit{\textbf{PoisonSwarm}} to how attackers can reliably launder malicious tasks via the speculative use of LLM crowdsourcing. Building upon a scheduler orchestrating crowdsourced LLMs, PoisonSwarm maps the given malicious task to a benign analogue to derive a content template, decomposes it into semantic units for crowdsourced unit-wise rewriting, and reassembles the outputs into malicious content. Experiments show its superiority over existing methods in data quality, diversity, and success rates. Regulation simulations further reveal the difficulty of governing such distributed, orchestrated misuse in MaaS ecosystems, highlighting the need for coordinated, ecosystem-level defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Good Are LLMs at Processing Tool Outputs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15955v2)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most realistic task automation problems require large language models (LLMs) to call tools, which often return complex JSON responses. These responses must be further processed to derive the information necessary for task completion. The ability of LLMs to do so is under-studied. In this paper, we study the tool response processing task and LLMs' abilities to process structured (JSON) responses. We created a dataset for this task, and evaluated 15 open and closed weight models using multiple prompting approaches. Our results show that JSON processing remains a difficult task even for frontier models across multiple prompting strategies. The optimal response processing strategy depends on both the nature and size of the tool outputs, as well as the complexity of the required reasoning. Variations in processing approaches can lead to performance differences ranging from 3\% to 50\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Chains to DAGs: Probing the Graph Structure of Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17593v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large language models has renewed interest in mechanistically characterizing how multi-step reasoning is represented and computed. While much prior work treats reasoning as a linear chain of steps, many reasoning problems are more naturally structured as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where intermediate conclusions may depend on multiple premises, branch into parallel sub-derivations, and later merge or be reused. Understanding whether such graph-structured reasoning is reflected in model internals remains an open question. In this work, we introduce Reasoning DAG Probing, a framework that directly asks whether LLM hidden states encode the geometry of a reasoning DAG in a linearly accessible form, and where this structure emerges across layers. Within this framework, we associate each reasoning node with a textual realization and train lightweight probes to predict two graph-theoretic properties from hidden states: node depth and pairwise node distance. We use these probes to analyze the layerwise emergence of DAG structure and evaluate controls that disrupt reasoning-relevant structure while preserving superficial textual properties. Our results provide evidence that reasoning DAG geometry is meaningfully encoded in intermediate layers, with recoverability varying systematically by node depth and model scale, suggesting that LLM reasoning is not only sequential but exhibits measurable internal graph structure.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental healthcare applications raises significant privacy concerns, especially regarding regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. In this work, we propose FedMentalCare, a privacy-preserving framework that leverages Federated Learning (FL) combined with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune LLMs for mental health analysis. We investigate the performance impact of varying client data volumes and model architectures (e.g., MobileBERT and MiniLM) in FL environments.

We propose FedMentor, a federated fine-tuning framework that integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and domain-aware Differential Privacy (DP) to meet per-domain privacy budgets while maintaining performance. Each client (domain) applies a custom DP noise scale proportional to its data sensitivity, and the server adaptively reduces noise when utility falls below a threshold. In experiments on three mental health datasets, we show that FedMentor improves safety over standard Federated Learning (FL) without privacy, raising safe output rates by up to three points and lowering toxicity, while maintaining utility (BERTScore F1 and ROUGE-L) within 0.5% of the non-private baseline and close to the centralized upper bound. The framework scales to backbones with up to 1.7B parameters on single-GPU clients, requiring < 173 MB of communication per-round. FedMentor demonstrates a practical approach to privately fine-tune LLMs for safer deployments in healthcare and other sensitive fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 GenAI4Health Workshop</p></details> |

Existing methods relying on keyword frequency or query spikes are inherently slow and ineffective in these sparse settings, lagging behind real-world shifts in attention. We introduce RTTP, a novel Real-Time Trending Prediction framework that generates search queries directly from news content instead of waiting for users to issue them. RTTP leverages a continual learning LLM (CL-LLM) that converts posts into search-style queries and scores them using engagement strength + creator authority, enabling early trend surfacing before search volume forms. To ensure adaptation without degrading reasoning, we propose Mix-Policy DPO, a new preference-based continual learning approach that combines on-policy stability with off-policy novelty to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during model upgrades. Deployed at production scale on Facebook and Meta AI products, RTTP delivers +91.4% improvement in tail-trend detection precision@500 and +19% query generation accuracy over industry baselines, while sustaining stable performance after multi-week online training. This work demonstrates that LLM-generated synthetic search signals, when aligned and continually updated, unlock timely trend understanding in low-traffic search environments.</p></details> |  |

Static, one-model-fits-all inference strategies are often inefficient, as they do not exploit the diverse range of available models or adapt to varying query requirements. This paper presents GreenServ, a dynamic, context-aware routing framework that optimizes the trade-off between inference accuracy and energy efficiency. GreenServ extracts lightweight contextual features from each query, including task type, semantic cluster, and text complexity, and routes queries to the most suitable model from a heterogeneous pool, based on observed accuracy and energy usage. We employ a multi-armed bandit approach to learn adaptive routing policies online. This approach operates under partial feedback, eliminates the need for extensive offline calibration, and streamlines the integration of new models into the inference pipeline. We evaluated GreenServ across five benchmark tasks and a pool of 16 contemporary open-access LLMs. Experimental results show that GreenServ consistently outperforms static (single-model) and random baselines. In particular, compared to random routing, GreenServ achieved a 22% increase in accuracy while reducing cumulative energy consumption by 31%. Finally, we evaluated GreenServ with RouterBench, achieving an average accuracy of 71.7% with a peak accuracy of 75.7%.

We present HeartLLM, a novel framework that integrates time-series (TS) and language modeling by enabling large language models (LLMs) to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into quantized codes using a lead-wise encoder and quantization module. These quantized codes are then mapped to an extended ECG vocabulary to form ECG tokens, enabling the model to process both ECG and natural language inputs within a unified framework. To bridge the modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG token forecasting task, allowing the LLM to capture temporal dynamics through its inherent language modeling capability. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model, HeartLLM achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of integrating discretized ECG tokens into LLMs for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, the ethical implications of LLM development, particularly in data harnessing, remain a critical challenge. Despite widespread discussion about the ethical compliance of LLMs -- especially concerning their data harnessing processes, there remains a notable absence of concrete frameworks to systematically guide or measure the ethical risks involved. In this paper we discuss a potential pathway for building an Ethical Risk Scoring (ERS) system to quantitatively assess the ethical integrity of the data harnessing process for AI systems. This system is based on a set of assessment questions grounded in core ethical principles, which are, in turn, supported by commanding ethical theories. By integrating measurable scoring mechanisms, this approach aims to foster responsible LLM development, balancing technological innovation with ethical accountability.</p></details> |  |

This leaves current automatic Speech-to-Speech (S2S) evaluation methods reliant on opaque and expensive Audio Language Models (ALMs). In this work, we propose TRACE (Textual Reasoning over Audio Cues for Evaluation), a novel framework that enables LLM judges to reason over audio cues to achieve cost-efficient and human-aligned S2S evaluation. To demonstrate the strength of the framework, we first introduce a Human Chain-of-Thought (HCoT) annotation protocol to improve the diagnostic capability of existing judge benchmarks by separating evaluation into explicit dimensions: content (C), voice quality (VQ), and paralinguistics (P). Using this data, TRACE constructs a textual blueprint of inexpensive audio signals and prompts an LLM to render dimension-wise judgments, fusing them into an overall rating via a deterministic policy. TRACE achieves higher agreement with human raters than ALMs and transcript-only LLM judges while being significantly more cost-effective. We will release the HCoT annotations and the TRACE framework to enable scalable and human-aligned S2S evaluation.</p></details> | EACL 2026 Findings |

We design experiments and develop a Behavioral Kalman Filter framework to quantify how LLM-based agents update expectations, acting as households or firm CEOs, update expectations when presented with individual and aggregate signals. The results from experiments and model estimation reveal four consistent patterns: (1) agents' weighting of priors and signals deviates from unity; (2) both household and firm CEO agents place substantially larger weights on individual signals compared to aggregate signals; (3) we identify a significant and negative interaction between concurrent signals, implying that the presence of multiple information sources diminishes the marginal weight assigned to each individual signal; and (4) expectation formation patterns differ significantly between household and firm CEO agents. Finally, we demonstrate that LoRA fine-tuning mitigates, but does not fully eliminate, behavioral biases in LLM expectation formation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Belief Reasoning with LLMs for Efficient Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21981v2)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents--a crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a Collaborative Belief World--an internal representation jointly modeling the physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables agents to parse external open-world knowledge into structured beliefs via a symbolic belief representation module, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World significantly reduces communication costs by 64-79% and improves task completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, existing Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) techniques -- including recent LLM-based systems -- are not directly applicable to continuous fuzzing. This is because these systems are designed and evaluated on a static, single-run benchmark setting, making them ill-suited for the diverse, noisy, and failure-prone environments in continuous fuzzing. To address these issues, we introduce PatchIsland, a system for Continuous Vulnerability Repair (CVR) that tightly integrates with continuous fuzzing pipelines. PatchIsland employs an ensemble of diverse LLM agents. By leveraging multiple LLM agents, PatchIsland can cover a wider range of settings (e.g., different projects, bug types, and programming languages) and also improve operational robustness. In addition, PatchIsland utilizes a two-phase patch-based deduplication to mitigate duplicate crashes and patches, which can be problematic in continuous fuzzing. In our internal evaluation, PatchIsland repaired 84 of 92 vulnerabilities, demonstrating strong repair capability. In the official AIxCC competition, the system operated with no human intervention in a fully autonomous environment and successfully patched 31 out of 43 vulnerabilities, achieving a repair rate of 72.1\%.</p></details> |  |

Current Large Language Models (LLMs), while adept at text-to-SQL translation, have not been rigorously evaluated on the more challenging task of debugging SQL issues. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-CRITIC, a new SQL issue debugging benchmark comprising 530 PostgreSQL tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-PG) and 570 multi-dialect tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-Multi), distilled from authentic user issues and replayed within new environments to facilitate rigorous evaluation. Baseline evaluations underscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini achieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on BIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks is crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy. Therefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for elevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This environment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates executable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified SQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore substantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which extracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs to produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training. We integrate these components into an open-source agent, Bird-Fixer. Based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B, Bird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on BIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing leading proprietary models such as Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, marking a significant step toward democratizing sophisticated SQL-debugging capabilities.

We find that, by averaging hidden-representation vectors of sentences sharing syntactic structure or meaning, we obtain vectors that capture a significant proportion of the syntactic and semantic information contained in the representations. In particular, subtracting these syntactic and semantic ``centroids'' from sentence vectors strongly affects their similarity with syntactically and semantically matched sentences, respectively, suggesting that syntax and semantics are, at least partially, linearly encoded. We also find that the cross-layer encoding profiles of syntax and semantics are different, and that the two signals can to some extent be decoupled, suggesting differential encoding of these two types of linguistic information in LLM representations.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage reasoning distillation framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from a powerful teacher LLM to a lightweight, deployment-friendly student model. In the first stage, we address the limitations of general-purpose LLMs by constructing a domain-adapted teacher model. This is achieved through a three-step process: domain-adaptive pre-training to inject platform knowledge, supervised fine-tuning to elicit reasoning skills, and preference optimization with a multi-dimensional reward model to ensure the generation of reliable and preference-aligned reasoning paths. This teacher can then automatically annotate massive query-service pairs from search logs with both relevance labels and reasoning chains. In the second stage, to address the challenges of architectural heterogeneity in standard distillation, we introduce Contrastive Reasoning Self-Distillation (CRSD). By modeling the behavior of the same student model under ``standard'' and ``reasoning-augmented'' inputs as a teacher-student relationship, CRSD enables the lightweight model to internalize the teacher's complex decision-making mechanisms without needing the explicit reasoning path at inference. Offline evaluations and online A/B testing in the Meituan search advertising system demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness and practical value.</p></details> | <details><summary>TheWe...</summary><p>TheWebConf 2026 Industry</p></details> |

However, systematic analyses of how such signals vary across training strategies and model scales remain lacking. In this paper, we analyze token-level signals through token probabilities across various models. We find that specific tokens strongly correlate with reasoning correctness, varying with training strategies while remaining stable across model scales. A closer look at the "wait" token in relation to answer probability demonstrates that models fine-tuned on small-scale datasets acquire reasoning ability through such signals but exploit them only partially. This work provides a systematic lens to observe and understand the dynamics of LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of mobile GUI agents. However, most LLM-powered mobile GUI agents operate in stepwise query-act loops, which incur high latency due to repeated LLM queries. We present GraphPilot, a mobile GUI agent that leverages knowledge graphs of the target apps to complete user tasks in almost one LLM query. GraphPilot operates in two complementary phases to enable efficient and reliable LLM-powered GUI task automation. In the offline phase, it explores target apps, records and analyzes interaction history, and constructs an app-specific knowledge graph that encodes functions of pages and elements as well as transition rules for each app. In the online phase, given an app and a user task, it leverages the knowledge graph of the given app to guide the reasoning process of LLM. When the reasoning process encounters uncertainty, GraphPilot dynamically requests the HTML representation of the current interface to refine subsequent reasoning. Finally, a validator checks the generated sequence of actions against the transition rules in the knowledge graph, performing iterative corrections to ensure it is valid. The structured, informative information in the knowledge graph allows the LLM to plan the complete sequence of actions required to complete the user task. On the DroidTask benchmark, GraphPilot improves task completion rate over Mind2Web and AutoDroid, while substantially reducing latency and the number of LLM queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by the Journal of Intelligent Computing and Networking (JICN) for publication</p></details> |

While static leaderboards provide snapshot rankings, they often mask the structural trade-offs between capabilities. In this work, we present ReLE (Robust Efficient Live Evaluation), a scalable system designed to diagnose Capability Anisotropy, the non-uniformity of model performance across domains. Using ReLE, we evaluate 304 models (189 commercial, 115 open-source) across a Domain $\times$ Capability orthogonal matrix comprising 207,843 samples. We introduce two methodological contributions to address current evaluation pitfalls: (1) A Symbolic-Grounded Hybrid Scoring Mechanism that eliminates embedding-based false positives in reasoning tasks; (2) A Dynamic Variance-Aware Scheduler based on Neyman allocation with noise correction, which reduces compute costs by 70\% compared to full-pass evaluations while maintaining a ranking correlation of $ρ=0.96$. Our analysis reveals that aggregate rankings are highly sensitive to weighting schemes: models exhibit a Rank Stability Amplitude (RSA) of 11.4 in ReLE versus $\sim$5.0 in traditional benchmarks, confirming that modern models are highly specialized rather than generally superior. We position ReLE not as a replacement for comprehensive static benchmarks, but as a high-frequency diagnostic monitor for the evolving model landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLM-Bench: Benchmarking and Analyzing Cross-lingual Misalignment of LLMs in Knowledge Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17397v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Editing (KE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for updating facts in Large Language Models (LLMs) without retraining. However, progress in Multilingual Knowledge Editing (MKE) is currently hindered by biased evaluation frameworks. We observe that existing MKE benchmarks are typically constructed by mechanically translating English-centric datasets into target languages (e.g., English-to-Chinese). This approach introduces translation artifacts and neglects culturally specific entities native to the target language, failing to reflect the true knowledge distribution of LLMs. To address this, we propose CLM-Bench, a culture-aware benchmark constructed using a native Chinese-first methodology. We curate 1,010 high-quality CounterFact pairs rooted in Chinese cultural contexts and align them with English counterparts. Using CLM-Bench, we conduct extensive experiments on representative LLMs (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen2) and reveal a significant Cross-lingual Misalignment: edits in one language function independently and fail to propagate to the other. We further provide a geometric explanation via layer-wise representation analysis, demonstrating that edit vectors for Chinese and English are nearly orthogonal -- residing in disjoint subspaces -- while mixed-lingual editing exhibits linear additivity of these vectors. Our findings challenge the effectiveness of current methods in cross-lingual transfer and underscore the importance of culturally native benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>EACL ...</summary><p>EACL MME workshop paper</p></details> |
| **[TELL-TALE: Task Efficient LLMs with Task Aware Layer Elimination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22767v2)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically deployed using a fixed architecture, despite growing evidence that not all layers contribute equally to every downstream task. In this work, we introduce TALE (Task-Aware Layer Elimination), an inference-time method that improves task performance by selectively removing layers that are irrelevant or detrimental for a given task. TALE optimizes task-specific validation performance, yielding a task-adapted architecture without retraining or modifying model weights. Across 9 tasks and 5 model families, under both zero-shot and few-shot settings, we show that TALE consistently matches or surpasses baseline performance while simultaneously reducing computational cost, outperforming general and layer-wise pruning approaches such as SLEB. Beyond inference-time gains, TALE synergizes with fine-tuning and few-shot learning, where task-adapted architectures lead to additional performance improvements. Computing TALE for a new task requires modest resources (1-2 GPU hours on an A100), making it a practical and deployable solution for task-specialized LLM inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAIQ: Auditing Demographic Attribute Inference from Question in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15830v2)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent evaluations of Large language models (LLMs) audit social bias primarily through prompts that explicitly reference demographic attributes, overlooking whether models infer sensitive demographics from neutral questions. Such inference constitutes epistemic overreach and raises concerns for privacy. We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a diagnostic audit framework for evaluating demographic inference under epistemic uncertainty. We evaluate 18 open- and closed-source LLMs across six real-world domains and five demographic attributes. We find that many models infer demographics from neutral questions, defaulting to socially dominant categories and producing stereotype-aligned rationales. These behaviors persist across model families, scales and decoding settings, indicating reliance on learned population priors. We further show that inferred demographics can condition downstream responses and that abstention oriented prompting substantially reduces unintended inference without model fine-tuning. Our results suggest that current bias evaluations are incomplete and motivate evaluation standards that assess not only how models respond to demographic information, but whether they should infer it at all.</p></details> | Preprint |

Prior context compression methods rely on predefined importance metrics or supervised compression models, rather than on the model's own inference-time behavior. We propose Sentinel, a lightweight sentence-level compression framework that treats context compression as an understanding decoding problem. Sentinel probes native attention behaviors of a frozen LLM with a lightweight readout to decode which parts of the context are actually utilized when answering a query, rather than using attention as a direct relevance score. We empirically observe that decoded relevance signals exhibit sufficient consistency across model scales to support effective compression with compact proxy models. On LongBench, Sentinel with a 0.5B proxy model achieves up to 5x compression while matching the QA performance of 7B-scale baselines, and despite being trained only on English QA data, generalizes effectively to Chinese and out-of-domain settings.</p></details> | Preprint |

While modern LLMs possess broad knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities. On eight frontier LLMs, BuildArena comprehensively evaluates their capabilities for language-driven and physics-grounded construction automation.

| **[Multi-Agent Learning Path Planning via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17346v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into intelligent tutoring systems offers transformative potential for personalized learning in higher education. However, most existing learning path planning approaches lack transparency, adaptability, and learner-centered explainability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Learning Path Planning (MALPP) framework that leverages a role- and rule-based collaboration mechanism among intelligent agents, each powered by LLMs. The framework includes three task-specific agents: a learner analytics agent, a path planning agent, and a reflection agent. These agents collaborate via structured prompts and predefined rules to analyze learning profiles, generate tailored learning paths, and iteratively refine them with interpretable feedback. Grounded in Cognitive Load Theory and Zone of Proximal Development, the system ensures that recommended paths are cognitively aligned and pedagogically meaningful. Experiments conducted on the MOOCCubeX dataset using seven LLMs show that MALPP significantly outperforms baseline models in path quality, knowledge sequence consistency, and cognitive load alignment. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the collaborative mechanism and theoretical constraints. This research contributes to the development of trustworthy, explainable AI in education and demonstrates a scalable approach to learner-centered adaptive instruction powered by LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are We Evaluating the Edit Locality of LLM Model Editing Properly?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17343v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing has recently emerged as a popular paradigm for efficiently updating knowledge in LLMs. A central desideratum of updating knowledge is to balance editing efficacy, i.e., the successful injection of target knowledge, and specificity (also known as edit locality), i.e., the preservation of existing non-target knowledge. However, we find that existing specificity evaluation protocols are inadequate for this purpose. We systematically elaborated on the three fundamental issues it faces. Beyond the conceptual issues, we further empirically demonstrate that existing specificity metrics are weakly correlated with the strength of specificity regularizers. We also find that current metrics lack sufficient sensitivity, rendering them ineffective at distinguishing the specificity performance of different methods. Finally, we propose a constructive evaluation protocol. Under this protocol, the conflict between open-ended LLMs and the assumption of determined answers is eliminated, query-independent fluency biases are avoided, and the evaluation strictness can be smoothly adjusted within a near-continuous space. Experiments across various LLMs, datasets, and editing methods show that metrics derived from the proposed protocol are more sensitive to changes in the strength of specificity regularizers and exhibit strong correlation with them, enabling more fine-grained discrimination of different methods' knowledge preservation capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Existing LLM-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which often overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool: jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a base pretrained model, without relying on closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as GPT-5 on most metrics. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches either limit emotions to categorical labels or cannot generalize to LLM-based architectures. We propose EMORL-TTS (Fine-grained Emotion-controllable TTS with Reinforcement Learning), a framework that unifies global intensity control in the VAD space with local emphasis regulation. Our method combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning guided by task-specific rewards for emotion category, intensity, and emphasis. Moreover, we further investigate how emphasis placement modulates fine-grained emotion intensity. Experiments show that EMORL-TTS improves emotion accuracy, intensity differentiation, and emphasis clarity, while preserving synthesis quality comparable to strong LLM-based baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Building on gradient accumulation with micro-batches, this paper introduces GreedySnake, a new SSD-offloaded training system that employs vertical scheduling, which executes all microbatches of a layer before proceeding to the next. Compared to existing systems that use horizontal scheduling (i.e., executing micro-batches sequentially), GreedySnake achieves higher training throughput with smaller batch sizes, bringing the system much closer to the ideal scenario predicted by the roofline model. To further mitigate the I/O bottleneck, GreedySnake overlaps part of the optimization step with the forward pass of the next iteration. Experimental results on A100 GPUs show that GreedySnake achieves saturated training throughput improvements over ZeRO-Infinity: 1.96x on 1 GPU and 1.93x on 4 GPUs for GPT-65B, and 2.53x on 1 GPU for GPT-175B.</p></details> |  |

While most prior studies assume that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate more advanced harmful task assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation on which RL relies: model response entropy. By constraining entropy, RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the escalation of harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task performance and finetunability. Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general defense.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Hompage: https://tokenbuncher.github.io/</p></details> |

Existing prompt injection detection methods often have sub-optimal performance and/or high computational overhead. In this work, we propose PIShield, an effective and efficient detection method based on the observation that instruction-tuned LLMs internally encode distinguishable signals for prompts containing injected instructions. PIShield leverages residual-stream representations and a simple linear classifier to detect prompt injection, without expensive model fine-tuning or response generation. We conduct extensive evaluations on a diverse set of short- and long-context benchmarks. The results show that PIShield consistently achieves low false positive and false negative rates, significantly outperforming existing baselines. These findings demonstrate that internal representations of instruction-tuned LLMs provide a powerful and practical foundation for prompt injection detection in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/weizou52/PIShield</p></details> |

While these features enable natural language search, summarization, and configuration assistance, they introduce risks such as hallucinations, harmful or out-of-scope advice, privacy and security issues, bias, instability under change, and adversarial misuse. Prior work on machine learning testing and AI assurance offers useful concepts but limited guidance for interactive, product-embedded assistants. This paper proposes a risk-based testing framework for LLM features in regulated software: a six-category risk taxonomy, a layered test strategy mapping risks to concrete tests across guardrail, orchestration, and system layers, and a case study applying the approach to a Knowledgebase assistant in a clinical research platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind the Ambiguity: Aleatoric Uncertainty Quantification in LLMs for Safe Medical Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17284v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of Large Language Models in Medical Question Answering is severely hampered by ambiguous user queries, a significant safety risk that demonstrably reduces answer accuracy in high-stakes healthcare settings. In this paper, we formalize this challenge by linking input ambiguity to aleatoric uncertainty (AU), which is the irreducible uncertainty arising from underspecified input. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct CV-MedBench, the first benchmark designed for studying input ambiguity in Medical QA. Using this benchmark, we analyze AU from a representation engineering perspective, revealing that AU is linearly encoded in LLM's internal activation patterns. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel AU-guided "Clarify-Before-Answer" framework, which incorporates AU-Probe - a lightweight module that detects input ambiguity directly from hidden states. Unlike existing uncertainty estimation methods, AU-Probe requires neither LLM fine-tuning nor multiple forward passes, enabling an efficient mechanism to proactively request user clarification and significantly enhance safety. Extensive experiments across four open LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our QA framework, with an average accuracy improvement of 9.48% over baselines. Our framework provides an efficient and robust solution for safe Medical QA, strengthening the reliability of health-related applications. The code is available at https://github.com/yaokunliu/AU-Med.git, and the CV-MedBench dataset is released on Hugging Face at https://huggingface.co/datasets/yaokunl/CV-MedBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The Web Conference 2026 (WWW 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Latent-Space Contrastive Reinforcement Learning for Stable and Efficient LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17275v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in surface-level text generation, their nature in handling complex multi-step reasoning tasks often remains one of ``statistical fitting'' rather than systematic logical deduction. Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) attempts to mitigate this by introducing a ``think-before-speak'' paradigm. However, applying RL directly in high-dimensional, discrete token spaces faces three inherent challenges: sample-inefficient rollouts, high gradient estimation variance, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To fundamentally address these structural bottlenecks, we propose \textbf{DeepLatent Reasoning (DLR)}, a latent-space bidirectional contrastive reinforcement learning framework. This framework shifts the trial-and-error cost from expensive token-level full sequence generation to the continuous latent manifold. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight assistant model to efficiently sample $K$ reasoning chain encodings within the latent space. These encodings are filtered via a dual reward mechanism based on correctness and formatting; only high-value latent trajectories are fed into a \textbf{frozen main model} for single-pass decoding. To maximize reasoning diversity while maintaining coherence, we design a contrastive learning objective to enable directed exploration within the latent space. Since the main model parameters remain frozen during optimization, this method mathematically eliminates catastrophic forgetting. Experiments demonstrate that under comparable GPU computational budgets, DLR achieves more stable training convergence, supports longer-horizon reasoning chains, and facilitates the sustainable accumulation of reasoning capabilities, providing a viable path toward reliable and scalable reinforcement learning for LLMs.</p></details> | 12 pages, |

However, existing ZO methods typically employ isotropic perturbations, neglecting the rich structural information available during the forward pass. In this paper, we identify a crucial link between gradient formation and activation structure: the gradient of a linear layer is confined to the subspace spanned by its input activations. Leveraging this insight, we propose Activation-Guided Zeroth-Order optimization (AGZO). Unlike prior methods, AGZO extracts a compact, activation-informed subspace on the fly during the forward pass and restricts perturbations to this low-rank subspace. We provide a theoretical framework showing that AGZO optimizes a subspace-smoothed objective and provably yields update directions with higher cosine similarity to the true gradient than isotropic baselines. Empirically, we evaluate AGZO on Qwen3 and Pangu models across various benchmarks. AGZO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ZO baselines and significantly narrows the performance gap with first-order fine-tuning, while maintaining almost the same peak memory footprint as other ZO methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages in total, including 9 pages of main text, with 4 figures and 3 tables.

However, directly applying the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to multi-turn tasks exposes notable limitations, particularly in scenarios requiring long-horizon reasoning. To address these challenges, we investigate more stable and effective advantage estimation strategies, especially for multi-turn settings. We first explore Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as an alternative and find it to be more robust than GRPO. To further enhance PPO in multi-turn scenarios, we introduce turn-PPO, a variant that operates on a turn-level MDP formulation, as opposed to the commonly used token-level MDP. Our results on the WebShop and Sokoban datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of turn-PPO, both with and without long reasoning components.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pushing the Envelope of LLM Inference on AI-PC and Intel GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06753v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of ultra-low-bit LLM models (1/1.58/2-bit), which match the perplexity and end-task performance of their full-precision counterparts using the same model size, is ushering in a new era of LLM inference for resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and AI PCs. While these quantization advances promise models that are more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption, the computational efficiency of state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference runtimes (e.g., bitnet.cpp) used to deploy them remains underexplored. In this work, we take a bottom-up approach: we first design and implement 1-bit and 2-bit microkernels optimized for modern CPUs, achieving peak computational efficiency across a variety of CPU platforms. We integrate these microkernels into a state-of-the-art LLM inference framework, namely PyTorch-TPP, and present end-to-end inference results with 2-bit models that outperform the current SOTA runtime bitnet.cpp by up to 2.2x, and deliver up to 7x speedup compared to the 16-bit model inference. We then extend this work to Intel GPUs where we design and implement mixed precision, 2-bit GEMM kernels, and show their performance to be close to optimal. We integrated our optimized Xe2 kernels in the vLLM framework as a quantization plugin and evaluated end-to-end LLM inference results for a range of LLM models and Xe2 GPUs. Depending on the model and platform, we see a 4x - 8x reduction in GEMM time compared to the BF16 case, and we get up to 6.3x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to the BF16 execution. Our optimized runtime advances the state of LLM inference on AI PCs and Intel Xe GPUs, paving the way for efficient deployment of ultra-low-bit LLM models.</p></details> |  |

We conduct a systematic literature review of child-LLM interaction risks and organize findings into a structured map that separates (i) parent-reported concerns, (ii) empirically documented harms, and (iii) gaps between perceived and observed risk. Moving beyond descriptive listing, we compare how different evidence streams in surveys, incident reports, youth interaction logs, and governance guidance operationalize "harm," where they conflict, and what mitigations they imply. Based on this synthesis, we propose a protection framework that couples child-specific content safety and developmental sensitivity with security-grade controls for adversarial misuse, including prompt injection and multimodal jailbreak pathways. The framework specifies measurable evaluation targets (e.g., harmful-content avoidance, age-calibrated readability, bias parity checks, prompt-injection robustness, and monitoring transparency) to support developers, educators, and policymakers in assessing and improving child-safe LLM deployments.</p></details> |  |

We introduce TrojanGYM, an agentic, LLM-driven framework that automatically curates HT insertions to expose detector blind spots while preserving design correctness. Given high-level HT specifications, a suite of cooperating LLM agents (instantiated with GPT-4, LLaMA-3.3-70B, and Gemini-2.5Pro) proposes and refines RTL modifications that realize diverse triggers and payloads without impacting normal functionality. TrojanGYM implements a feedback-driven benchmark generation loop co-designed with HT detectors, in which constraint-aware syntactic checking and GNN-based HT detectors provide feedback that iteratively refines HT specifications and insertion strategies to better surface detector blind spots. We further propose Robust-GNN4TJ, a new implementation of the GNN4TJ with improved graph extraction, training robustness, and prediction reliability, especially on LLM-generated HT designs. On the most challenging TrojanGYM-generated benchmarks, Robust-GNN4TJ raises HT detection rates from 0% to 60% relative to a prior GNN-based detector. We instantiate TrojanGYM on SRAM, AES-128, and UART designs at RTL level, and show that it systematically produces diverse, functionally correct HTs that reach up to 83.33% evasion rates against modern GNN-based detectors, revealing robustness gaps that are not apparent when these detectors are evaluated solely on existing TrustHub-style benchmarks. Post peer-review, we will release all codes and artifacts.</p></details> |  |

Auditing Demographic Bias in LLM-Generated Targeted Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17172v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of generating personalized, persuasive text at scale, raising new questions about bias and fairness in automated communication. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of how LLMs behave when tasked with demographic-conditioned targeted messaging. We introduce a controlled evaluation framework using three leading models -- GPT-4o, Llama-3.3, and Mistral-Large 2.1 -- across two generation settings: Standalone Generation, which isolates intrinsic demographic effects, and Context-Rich Generation, which incorporates thematic and regional context to emulate realistic targeting. We evaluate generated messages along three dimensions: lexical content, language style, and persuasive framing. We instantiate this framework on climate communication and find consistent age- and gender-based asymmetries across models: male- and youth-targeted messages emphasize agency, innovation, and assertiveness, while female- and senior-targeted messages stress warmth, care, and tradition. Contextual prompts systematically amplify these disparities, with persuasion scores significantly higher for messages tailored to younger or male audiences. Our findings demonstrate how demographic stereotypes can surface and intensify in LLM-generated targeted communication, underscoring the need for bias-aware generation pipelines and transparent auditing frameworks that explicitly account for demographic conditioning in socially sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Debate, Deliberate, Decide (D3): A Cost-Aware Adversarial Framework for Reliable and Interpretable LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04663v4)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging due to inconsistency, bias, and the absence of transparent decision criteria in automated judging. We present Debate, Deliberate, Decide (D3), a cost-aware, adversarial multi-agent framework that orchestrates structured debate among role-specialized agents (advocates, a judge, and an optional jury) to produce reliable and interpretable evaluations. D3 instantiates two complementary protocols: (1) Multi-Advocate One-Round Evaluation (MORE), which elicits k parallel defenses per answer to amplify signal via diverse advocacy, and (2) Single-Advocate Multi-Round Evaluation (SAMRE) with budgeted stopping, which iteratively refines arguments under an explicit token budget and convergence checks. We develop a probabilistic model of score gaps that (i) characterizes reliability and convergence under iterative debate and (ii) explains the separation gains from parallel advocacy. Under mild assumptions, the posterior distribution of the round-r gap concentrates around the true difference and the probability of mis-ranking vanishes; moreover, aggregating across k advocates provably increases expected score separation. We complement theory with a rigorous experimental suite across MT-Bench, AlignBench, and AUTO-J, showing state-of-the-art agreement with human judgments (accuracy and Cohen's kappa), reduced positional and verbosity biases via anonymization and role diversification, and a favorable cost-accuracy frontier enabled by budgeted stopping. Ablations and qualitative analyses isolate the contributions of debate, aggregation, and anonymity. Together, these results establish D3 as a principled, practical recipe for reliable, interpretable, and cost-aware LLM evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Personas as a Substitute for Field Experiments in Method Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21080v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Field experiments (A/B tests) are often the most credible benchmark for methods (algorithms) in societal systems, but their cost and latency bottleneck rapid methodological progress. LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the method's identity or provenance (method-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Collaborate: An Orchestrated-Decentralized Framework for Peer-to-Peer LLM Federation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17133v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized domains is constrained by a fundamental challenge: the need for diverse, cross-organizational data conflicts with the principles of data privacy and sovereignty. While Federated Learning (FL) provides a framework for collaboration without raw data exchange, its classic centralized form introduces a single point of failure and remains vulnerable to model inversion attacks. Decentralized FL (DFL) mitigates this risk by removing the central aggregator but typically relies on inefficient, random peer-to-peer (P2P) pairings, forming a collaboration graph that is blind to agent heterogeneity and risks negative transfer. This paper introduces KNEXA-FL, a novel framework for orchestrated decentralization that resolves this trade-off. KNEXA-FL employs a non-aggregating Central Profiler/Matchmaker (CPM) that formulates P2P collaboration as a contextual bandit problem, using a LinUCB algorithm on abstract agent profiles to learn an optimal matchmaking policy. It orchestrates direct knowledge exchange between heterogeneous, PEFT-based LLM agents via secure distillation, without ever accessing the models themselves. Our comprehensive experiments on a challenging code generation task show that KNEXA-FL yields substantial gains, improving Pass@1 by approx. 50% relative to random P2P collaboration. Critically, our orchestrated approach demonstrates stable convergence, in stark contrast to a powerful centralized distillation baseline which suffers from catastrophic performance collapse. Our work establishes adaptive, learning-based orchestration as a foundational principle for building robust and effective decentralized AI ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026. 13 pages, 3 figures, 10 tables.

In this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional location references. Building on recent work demonstrating LLMs' abilities to reason over geospatial data, we evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger off-the-shelf models.</p></details> | EACL 2026 |
| **[A Scalable Measure of Loss Landscape Curvature for Analyzing the Training Dynamics of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16979v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on Proceedings of the ACM on Web Conference 2026 (WWW 2026)</p></details> |
| **[AgentDrive: An Open Benchmark Dataset for Agentic AI Reasoning with LLM-Generated Scenarios in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16964v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has sparked growing interest in their integration into autonomous systems for reasoning-driven perception, planning, and decision-making. However, evaluating and training such agentic AI models remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale, structured, and safety-critical benchmarks. This paper introduces AgentDrive, an open benchmark dataset containing 300,000 LLM-generated driving scenarios designed for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating autonomous agents under diverse conditions. AgentDrive formalizes a factorized scenario space across seven orthogonal axes: scenario type, driver behavior, environment, road layout, objective, difficulty, and traffic density. An LLM-driven prompt-to-JSON pipeline generates semantically rich, simulation-ready specifications that are validated against physical and schema constraints. Each scenario undergoes simulation rollouts, surrogate safety metric computation, and rule-based outcome labeling. To complement simulation-based evaluation, we introduce AgentDrive-MCQ, a 100,000-question multiple-choice benchmark spanning five reasoning dimensions: physics, policy, hybrid, scenario, and comparative reasoning. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of fifty leading LLMs on AgentDrive-MCQ. Results show that while proprietary frontier models perform best in contextual and policy reasoning, advanced open models are rapidly closing the gap in structured and physics-grounded reasoning. We release the AgentDrive dataset, AgentDrive-MCQ benchmark, evaluation code, and related materials at https://github.com/maferrag/AgentDrive</p></details> | 16 pages |

Checkpointing this massive, distributed state is critical for a wide range of use cases, such as resilience, suspend-resume, investigating undesirable training trajectories, and explaining model evolution. However, existing checkpointing solutions typically treat model state as opaque binary blobs, ignoring the ``3D heterogeneity'' of the underlying data structures--varying by memory location (GPU vs. Host), number of ``logical'' objects sharded and split across multiple files, data types (tensors vs. Python objects), and their serialization requirements. This results in significant runtime overheads due to blocking device-to-host transfers, data-oblivious serialization, and storage I/O contention. In this paper, we introduce DataStates-LLM, a novel checkpointing architecture that leverages State Providers to decouple state abstraction from data movement. DataStates-LLM exploits the immutability of model parameters during the forward and backward passes to perform ``lazy'', non-blocking asynchronous snapshots. By introducing State Providers, we efficiently coalesce fragmented, heterogeneous shards and overlap the serialization of metadata with bulk tensor I/O. We evaluate DataStates-LLM on models up to 70B parameters on 256 A100-40GB GPUs. Our results demonstrate that DataStates-LLM achieves up to 4$\times$ higher checkpointing throughput and reduces end-to-end training time by up to 2.2$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions, effectively mitigating the serialization and heterogeneity bottlenecks in extreme-scale LLM training.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProveRAG: Provenance-Driven Vulnerability Analysis with Automated Retrieval-Augmented LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17406v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cybersecurity, security analysts constantly face the challenge of mitigating newly discovered vulnerabilities in real-time, with over 300,000 vulnerabilities identified since 1999. The sheer volume of known vulnerabilities complicates the detection of patterns for unknown threats. While LLMs can assist, they often hallucinate and lack alignment with recent threats. Over 40,000 vulnerabilities have been identified in 2024 alone, which are introduced after most popular LLMs' (e.g., GPT-5) training data cutoff. This raises a major challenge of leveraging LLMs in cybersecurity, where accuracy and up-to-date information are paramount. Therefore, we aim to improve the adaptation of LLMs in vulnerability analysis by mimicking how an analyst performs such tasks. We propose ProveRAG, an LLM-powered system designed to assist in rapidly analyzing vulnerabilities with automated retrieval augmentation of web data while self-evaluating its responses with verifiable evidence. ProveRAG incorporates a self-critique mechanism to help alleviate the omission and hallucination common in the output of LLMs applied in cybersecurity applications. The system cross-references data from verifiable sources (NVD and CWE), giving analysts confidence in the actionable insights provided. Our results indicate that ProveRAG excels in delivering verifiable evidence to the user with over 99% and 97% accuracy in exploitation and mitigation strategies, respectively. ProveRAG guides analysts to secure their systems more effectively by overcoming temporal and context-window limitations while also documenting the process for future audits.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Based Adversarial Persuasion Attacks on Fact-Checking Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16890v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated fact-checking (AFC) systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks, enabling false claims to evade detection. Existing adversarial frameworks typically rely on injecting noise or altering semantics, yet no existing framework exploits the adversarial potential of persuasion techniques, which are widely used in disinformation campaigns to manipulate audiences. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of persuasive adversarial attacks on AFCs by employing a generative LLM to rephrase claims using persuasion techniques. Considering 15 techniques grouped into 6 categories, we study the effects of persuasion on both claim verification and evidence retrieval using a decoupled evaluation strategy. Experiments on the FEVER and FEVEROUS benchmarks show that persuasion attacks can substantially degrade both verification performance and evidence retrieval. Our analysis identifies persuasion techniques as a potent class of adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for more robust AFC systems.</p></details> |  |

However, their direct application to session-based recommendation (SBR) remains challenging due to severe session context scarcity and poor scalability. In this paper, we propose SPRINT, a scalable SBR framework that incorporates reliable and informative intents while ensuring high efficiency in both training and inference. SPRINT constrains LLM-based profiling with a global intent pool and validates inferred intents based on recommendation performance to mitigate noise and hallucinations under limited context. To ensure scalability, LLMs are selectively invoked only for uncertain sessions during training, while a lightweight intent predictor generalizes intent prediction to all sessions without LLM dependency at inference time. Experiments on real-world datasets show that SPRINT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while providing more explainable recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs Got Rhythm? Hybrid Phonological Filtering for Greek Poetry Rhyme Detection and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09631v4)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities across NLP tasks, struggle with phonologically-grounded phenomena like rhyme detection and generation. This is even more evident in lower-resource languages such as Modern Greek. In this paper, we present a hybrid system that combines LLMs with deterministic phonological algorithms to achieve accurate rhyme identification/analysis and generation. Our approach implements a comprehensive taxonomy of Greek rhyme types, including Pure, Rich, Imperfect, Mosaic, and Identical Pre-rhyme Vowel (IDV) patterns, and employs an agentic generation pipeline with phonological verification. We evaluate multiple prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and RAG-augmented) across several LLMs including Claude 3.7 and 4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 and open-weight models like Llama 3.1 8B and 70B and Mistral Large. Results reveal a significant "Reasoning Gap": while native-like models (Claude 3.7) perform intuitively (40\% accuracy in identification), reasoning-heavy models (Claude 4.5) achieve state-of-the-art performance (54\%) only when prompted with Chain-of-Thought. Most critically, pure LLM generation fails catastrophically (under 4\% valid poems), while our hybrid verification loop restores performance to 73.1\%. We release our system and a corpus of 40,000+ rhymes, derived from the Anemoskala and Interwar Poetry corpora, to support future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Persuasion Tokens for Editing Factual Knowledge in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16781v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context knowledge editing (IKE) is a promising technique for updating Large Language Models (LLMs) with new information. However, IKE relies on lengthy, fact-specific demonstrations which are costly to create and consume significant context window space. In this paper, we introduce persuasion tokens (P-Tokens) -- special tokens trained to replicate the effect of IKE demonstrations, enabling efficient knowledge editing without requiring fact-specific demonstrations. We evaluate P-Tokens across two editing datasets and three LLMs, demonstrating performance comparable to, and often exceeding, IKE. We further find that editing performance is robust to distractors with small negative effects to neighboring facts, and that increasing the number of P-Tokens improves performance. Our work addresses key limitations of IKE and provides a more practical and scalable alternative for editing LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EACL Main 2026</p></details> |
| **[LLM-powered Real-time Patent Citation Recommendation for Financial Technologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16775v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid financial innovation has been accompanied by a sharp increase in patenting activity, making timely and comprehensive prior-art discovery more difficult. This problem is especially evident in financial technologies, where innovations develop quickly, patent collections grow continuously, and citation recommendation systems must be updated as new applications arrive. Existing patent retrieval and citation recommendation methods typically rely on static indexes or periodic retraining, which limits their ability to operate effectively in such dynamic settings. In this study, we propose a real-time patent citation recommendation framework designed for large and fast-changing financial patent corpora. Using a dataset of 428,843 financial patents granted by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) between 2000 and 2024, we build a three-stage recommendation pipeline. The pipeline uses large language model (LLM) embeddings to represent the semantic content of patent abstracts, applies efficient approximate nearest-neighbor search to construct a manageable candidate set, and ranks candidates by semantic similarity to produce top-k citation recommendations. In addition to improving recommendation accuracy, the proposed framework directly addresses the dynamic nature of patent systems. By using an incremental indexing strategy based on hierarchical navigable small-world (HNSW) graphs, newly issued patents can be added without rebuilding the entire index. A rolling day-by-day update experiment shows that incremental updating improves recall while substantially reducing computational cost compared with rebuild-based indexing. The proposed method also consistently outperforms traditional text-based baselines and alternative nearest-neighbor retrieval approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do LLM hallucination detectors suffer from low-resource effect?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16766v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs, while outperforming humans in a wide range of tasks, can still fail in unanticipated ways. We focus on two pervasive failure modes: (i) hallucinations, where models produce incorrect information about the world, and (ii) the low-resource effect, where the models show impressive performance in high-resource languages like English but the performance degrades significantly in low-resource languages like Bengali. We study the intersection of these issues and ask: do hallucination detectors suffer from the low-resource effect? We conduct experiments on five tasks across three domains (factual recall, STEM, and Humanities). Experiments with four LLMs and three hallucination detectors reveal a curious finding: As expected, the task accuracies in low-resource languages experience large drops (compared to English). However, the drop in detectors' accuracy is often several times smaller than the drop in task accuracy. Our findings suggest that even in low-resource languages, the internal mechanisms of LLMs might encode signals about their uncertainty. Further, the detectors are robust within language (even for non-English) and in multilingual setups, but not in cross-lingual settings without in-language supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EACL 2026 (Main)</p></details> |

While the de facto standard to deal with the problem is to treat unjudged documents as non-relevant, many alternatives have been proposed, such as the use of large language models (LLMs) as a relevance judge (LLM-as-a-judge). However, this has been criticized, among other things, as circular, since the same LLM can be used as the ranker and the judge. We propose to train topic-specific relevance classifiers instead: By finetuning monoT5 with independent LoRA weight adaptation on the judgments of a single assessor for a single topic's pool, we align it to that assessor's notion of relevance for the topic. The system rankings obtained through our classifier's relevance judgments achieve a Spearmans' $ρ$ correlation of $>0.94$ with ground truth system rankings. As little as 128 initial human judgments per topic suffice to improve the comparability of models, compared to treating unjudged documents as non-relevant, while achieving more reliability than existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Topic-specific relevance classifiers are thus a lightweight and straightforward way to tackle the unjudged document problem, while maintaining human judgments as the gold standard for retrieval evaluation. Code, models, and data are made openly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) offer a knowledge base to improve the limited effectiveness of cross-domain transfer learning for tabular data. However, LLM performance often stagnates due to subjective text prompts and the computational limitations of in-context learning. We present a novel language-to-tabular context-learning method that uses attention-specific transformer weights, enabling seamless transfer learning across disparate tabular data sets. The LLM attention transplant mechanism facilitates a domain-agnostic transfer learning, eliminating the need for shared features between tables, LLM prompt engineering, and large-scale pretrained models. Our experiments using ten pairs of disjoint source-target data sets and 12 baseline methods demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LLM-attention transplant for transfer learning (LATTLE) method over traditional ML models, state-of-the-art deep tabular architectures, and models trained on thousands to billions of tabular samples. The proposed cross-domain attention transfer demonstrates an effective solution for adapting LLMs to learning non-text tabular data in a low-resource environment. The source code of the LATTLE implementation is publicly available.</p></details> |  |

First, we propose an evaluation framework built on hierarchical concept indices and novel metrics to measure generalization. Second, we explore LLM-based Auto-Labeled Data (ALD) as a scalable resource, creating a task-specific pipeline for its generation. Our research unequivocally shows that while LLM-generated ALD cannot fully substitute for manual annotations, it is a valuable resource for improving generalization, successfully providing models with the broader coverage and structural knowledge needed to approach recognizing unseen concepts.

This can cause misalignment between expressed and intended requirements, complicating elicitation and validation. Traditional elicitation techniques, such as interviews and follow-up sessions, are time-consuming and risk distorting stakeholders' original intent across iterations. Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer user intentions from context, suggesting potential for assisting stakeholders in expressing their needs. This raises the questions of (i) how effectively LLMs can support requirement expression and (ii) whether such support benefits stakeholders with limited domain expertise. We conducted a study with 26 participants who produced 130 requirement statements. Each participant first expressed requirements unaided, then evaluated LLM-generated revisions tailored to their context. Participants rated LLM revisions significantly higher than their original statements across all dimensions-alignment with intent, readability, reasoning, and unambiguity. Qualitative feedback further showed that LLM revisions often surfaced tacit details stakeholders considered important and helped them better understand their own requirements. We present and evaluate a stakeholder-centered approach that leverages LLMs as articulation aids in requirements elicitation and validation. Our results show that LLM-assisted reformulation improves perceived completeness, clarity, and alignment of requirements. By keeping stakeholders in the validation loop, this approach promotes responsible and trustworthy use of AI in Requirements Engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the research track of the 32nd International Working Conference on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ 2026)</p></details> |

Jailbreak detection methods show promise in mitigating jailbreak attacks through the assistance of other models or multiple model inferences. However, existing methods entail significant computational costs. In this paper, we first present a finding that the difference in output distributions between jailbreak and benign prompts can be employed for detecting jailbreak prompts. Based on this finding, we propose a Free Jailbreak Detection (FJD) which prepends an affirmative instruction to the input and scales the logits by temperature to further distinguish between jailbreak and benign prompts through the confidence of the first token. Furthermore, we enhance the detection performance of FJD through the integration of virtual instruction learning. Extensive experiments on aligned LLMs show that our FJD can effectively detect jailbreak prompts with almost no additional computational costs during LLM inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Findings) https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-emnlp.309/</p></details> |

However, existing legal benchmarks rely on simplified and highly standardized tasks, failing to capture the ambiguity, complexity, and reasoning demands of real legal practice. Moreover, prior evaluations often adopt coarse, single-dimensional metrics and do not explicitly assess fine-grained legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce PLawBench, a Practical Law Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic legal practice scenarios. Grounded in real-world legal workflows, PLawBench models the core processes of legal practitioners through three task categories: public legal consultation, practical case analysis, and legal document generation. These tasks assess a model's ability to identify legal issues and key facts, perform structured legal reasoning, and generate legally coherent documents. PLawBench comprises 850 questions across 13 practical legal scenarios, with each question accompanied by expert-designed evaluation rubrics, resulting in approximately 12,500 rubric items for fine-grained assessment. Using an LLM-based evaluator aligned with human expert judgments, we evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results show that none achieves strong performance on PLawBench, revealing substantial limitations in the fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and highlighting important directions for future evaluation and development of legal LLMs. Data is available at: https://github.com/skylenage/PLawbench.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating Lower-dimensional Vectors for LLM Training Data Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16651v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient-based methods for instance-based explanation for large language models (LLMs) are hindered by the immense dimensionality of model gradients. In practice, influence estimation is restricted to a subset of model parameters to make computation tractable, but this subset is often chosen ad hoc and rarely justified by systematic evaluation. This paper investigates if it is better to create low-dimensional representations by selecting a small, architecturally informed subset of model components or by projecting the full gradients into a lower-dimensional space. Using a novel benchmark, we show that a greedily selected subset of components captures the information about training data influence needed for a retrieval task more effectively than either the full gradient or random projection. We further find that this approach is more computationally efficient than random projection, demonstrating that targeted component selection is a practical strategy for making instance-based explanations of large models more computationally feasible.</p></details> | 8 pages |

CoT typically outperforms direct prompting primarily because it can exploit abundant Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) datasets to explicitly model its steps. In this paper, we systematically compare CoT and Direct prompting under increasing amounts of S2TT data. To this end, we pseudo-label an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six European languages, and train LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting strategies at different data scales. Our results show that Direct improves more consistently as the amount of data increases, suggesting that it may become a more effective approach as larger S2TT resources are created.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proc.

Benchmarking Rational Preference Utilization in Personalized Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16621v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-powered assistants have recently integrated memory mechanisms that record user preferences, leading to more personalized and user-aligned responses. However, irrelevant personalized memories are often introduced into the context, interfering with the LLM's intent understanding. To comprehensively investigate the dual effects of personalization, we develop RPEval, a benchmark comprising a personalized intent reasoning dataset and a multi-granularity evaluation protocol. RPEval reveals the widespread phenomenon of irrational personalization in existing LLMs and, through error pattern analysis, illustrates its negative impact on user experience. Finally, we introduce RP-Reasoner, which treats memory utilization as a pragmatic reasoning process, enabling the selective integration of personalized information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms carefully designed baselines on RPEval, and resolves 80% of the bad cases observed in a large-scale commercial personalized assistant, highlighting the potential of pragmatic reasoning to mitigate irrational personalization. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/XueyangFeng/RPEval.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose PROST-LLM (PROgressive Speech-to-speech Translation) to enhance the S2ST capabilities in LLMs progressively. First, we fine-tune the LLMs with the CVSS corpus, employing designed tri-task learning and chain of modality methods to boost the initial performance. Then, leveraging the fine-tuned model, we generate preference pairs through self-sampling and back-translation without human evaluation. Finally, these preference pairs are used for preference optimization to enhance the model's S2ST capability further. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed PROST-LLM in improving the S2ST capability of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

This paper addresses the gap by focusing on the application of LLMs to the United Nations (UN) decision-making process, where the stakes are particularly high and political decisions can have far-reaching consequences. We introduce a novel dataset comprising publicly available UN Security Council (UNSC) records from 1994 to 2024, including draft resolutions, voting records, and diplomatic speeches. Using this dataset, we propose the United Nations Benchmark (UNBench), the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across four interconnected political science tasks: co-penholder judgment, representative voting simulation, draft adoption prediction, and representative statement generation. These tasks span the three stages of the UN decision-making process--drafting, voting, and discussing--and aim to assess LLMs' ability to understand and simulate political dynamics. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the potential and challenges of applying LLMs in this domain, providing insights into their strengths and limitations in political science. This work contributes to the growing intersection of AI and political science, opening new avenues for research and practical applications in global governance.

However, the source code generated by the LLMs does not always meet quality requirements and may fail to compile. Therefore, many studies evolve into agents that can reason about the problem before generating the source code for the solution. The goal of this paper is to study the degree to which such agents benefit from access to software development tools, in our case, a gcc compiler. We conduct a computational experiment on the RosettaCode dataset, on 699 programming tasks in C. We evaluate how the integration with a compiler shifts the role of the language model from a passive generator to an active agent capable of iteratively developing runnable programs based on feedback from the compiler. We evaluated 16 language models with sizes ranging from small (135 million) to medium (3 billion) and large (70 billion). Our results show that access to a compiler improved the compilation success by 5.3 to 79.4 percentage units in compilation without affecting the semantics of the generated program. Syntax errors dropped by 75%, and errors related to undefined references dropped by 87% for the tasks where the agents outperformed the baselines. We also observed that in some cases, smaller models with a compiler outperform larger models with a compiler. We conclude that it is essential for LLMs to have access to software engineering tools to enhance their performance and reduce the need for large models in software engineering, such as reducing our energy footprint.</p></details> |  |

Through a user study with participants across the United States, India, Kenya, and Nigeria, we investigate whether LLM-simulated users serve as reliable proxies for real human users in evaluating agents on τ-Bench retail tasks. We find that user simulation lacks robustness, with agent success rates varying up to 9 percentage points across different user LLMs. Furthermore, evaluations using simulated users exhibit systematic miscalibration, underestimating agent performance on challenging tasks and overestimating it on moderately difficult ones. African American Vernacular English (AAVE) speakers experience consistently worse success rates and calibration errors than Standard American English (SAE) speakers, with disparities compounding significantly with age. We also find simulated users to be a differentially effective proxy for different populations, performing worst for AAVE and Indian English speakers. Additionally, simulated users introduce conversational artifacts and surface different failure patterns than human users. These findings demonstrate that current evaluation practices risk misrepresenting agent capabilities across diverse user populations and may obscure real-world deployment challenges.</p></details> |  |

This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option. The experiment suggests that foundation models are not universally superior and that the effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is highly dependent on the adaptation strategy, as minimal fine-tuning proved detrimental in this study.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, paper accepted in AAIML'26 conference</p></details> |

| **[Decentralized Learning Strategies for Estimation Error Minimization with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12662v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address real-time sampling and estimation of autoregressive Markovian sources in dynamic yet structurally similar multi-hop wireless networks. Each node caches samples from others and communicates over wireless collision channels, aiming to minimize time-average estimation error via decentralized policies. Due to the high dimensionality of action spaces and complexity of network topologies, deriving optimal policies analytically is intractable. To address this, we propose a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for policy optimization. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed policies are transferable, allowing a policy trained on one graph to be effectively applied to structurally similar graphs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed policy outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) the trained policies are transferable to larger networks, with performance gains increasing with the number of agents; (iii) the graphical training procedure withstands non-stationarity, even when using independent learning techniques; and (iv) recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches require either sharing sensitive transaction data or operating in isolation, leaving critical cross-chain laundering patterns undetected. We present FedGraph-VASP, a privacy-preserving federated graph learning framework that enables collaborative anti-money laundering (AML) without exposing raw user data. Our key contribution is a Boundary Embedding Exchange protocol that shares only compressed, non-invertible graph neural network representations of boundary accounts. These exchanges are secured using post-quantum cryptography, specifically the NIST-standardized Kyber-512 key encapsulation mechanism combined with AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption. Experiments on the Elliptic Bitcoin dataset with realistic Louvain partitioning show that FedGraph-VASP achieves an F1-score of 0.508, outperforming the state-of-the-art generative baseline FedSage+ (F1 = 0.453) by 12.1 percent on binary fraud detection. We further show robustness under low-connectivity settings where generative imputation degrades performance, while approaching centralized performance (F1 = 0.620) in high-connectivity regimes. We additionally evaluate generalization on an Ethereum fraud detection dataset, where FedGraph-VASP (F1 = 0.635) is less effective under sparse cross-silo connectivity, while FedSage+ excels (F1 = 0.855), outperforming even local training (F1 = 0.785). These results highlight a topology-dependent trade-off: embedding exchange benefits connected transaction graphs, whereas generative imputation can dominate in highly modular sparse graphs. A privacy audit shows embeddings are only partially invertible (R^2 = 0.32), limiting exact feature recovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convexified Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18289v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are key tools for graph representation learning, demonstrating strong results across diverse prediction tasks. In this paper, we present Convexified Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks (CGNNs), a novel and general framework that combines the power of message-passing GNNs with the tractability of convex optimization. By mapping their nonlinear filters into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, CGNNs transform training into a convex optimization problem, which projected gradient methods can solve both efficiently and optimally. Convexity further allows CGNNs' statistical properties to be analyzed accurately and rigorously. For two-layer CGNNs, we establish rigorous generalization guarantees, showing convergence to the performance of an optimal GNN. To scale to deeper architectures, we adopt a principled layer-wise training strategy. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CGNNs significantly exceed the performance of leading GNN models, obtaining 10-40% higher accuracy in most cases, underscoring their promise as a powerful and principled method with strong theoretical foundations. In rare cases where improvements are not quantitatively substantial, the convex models either slightly exceed or match the baselines, stressing their robustness and wide applicability. Though over-parameterization is often used to enhance performance in non-convex models, we show that our CGNNs yield shallow convex models that can surpass non-convex ones in accuracy and model compactness.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in 29th Annual Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), 2026</p></details> |

Kolmogorov-Arnold Graph Neural Networks (KAGNNs) expand on the existing set of GNN models with KAN-based counterparts. KAGNNs have been demonstrably successful in surpassing the accuracy of MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP)-based GNNs in the task of molecular property prediction. These models were widely tested on the graph datasets consisting of organic molecules. In this study, we explore the application of KAGNNs towards inorganic nanomaterials. In 2024, a large scale inorganic nanomaterials dataset was published under the title CHILI (Chemically-Informed Large-scale Inorganic Nanomaterials Dataset), and various MLP-based GNNs have been tested on this dataset. We adapt and test our own KAGNNs appropriate for eight defined tasks. Our experiments reveal that, KAGNNs frequently surpass the performance of their counterpart GNNs. Most notably, on crystal system and space group classification tasks in CHILI-3K, KAGNNs achieve the new state-of-the-art results of 99.5 percent and 96.6 percent accuracy, respectively, compared to the previous 65.7 and 73.3 percent each.</p></details> |  |
| **[CondenseGraph: Communication-Efficient Distributed GNN Training via On-the-Fly Graph Condensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17774v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN) training suffers from substantial communication overhead due to the inherent neighborhood dependency in graph-structured data. This neighbor explosion problem requires workers to frequently exchange boundary node features across partitions, creating a communication bottleneck that severely limits training scalability. Existing approaches rely on static graph partitioning strategies that cannot adapt to dynamic network conditions. In this paper, we propose CondenseGraph, a novel communication-efficient framework for distributed GNN training. Our key innovation is an on-the-fly graph condensation mechanism that dynamically compresses boundary node features into compact super nodes before transmission. To compensate for the information loss introduced by compression, we develop a gradient-based error feedback mechanism that maintains convergence guarantees while reducing communication volume by 40-60%. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CondenseGraph achieves comparable accuracy to full-precision baselines while significantly reducing communication costs and training time.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATLAS: Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14908v3)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ATLAS (Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs), a novel graph learning algorithm that addresses two important challenges in graph neural networks (GNNs). First, the accuracy of GNNs degrades when the graph is heterophilic. Second, iterative feature aggregation limits the scalability of GNNs to large graphs. We address these challenges by extracting topological information about graph communities at multiple levels of refinement, concatenating community assignments to the feature vector, and applying multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to the resulting representation. This provides topological context about nodes and their neighborhoods without invoking aggregation. Because MLPs are typically more scalable than GNNs, our approach applies to large graphs without the need for sampling. Across a wide set of graphs, ATLAS achieves comparable accuracy to baseline methods, with gains as high as 20 percentage points over GCN for heterophilic graphs with negative structural bias and 11 percentage points over MLP for homophilic graphs. Furthermore, we show how multi-resolution community features systematically modulate performance in both homophilic and heterophilic settings, opening a principled path toward explainable graph learning.</p></details> | Preprint |

Traditional approaches might rely solely on SC due to limited functional data availability, hindering comprehension of cognitive and behavioral impairments in individuals with SZ by neglecting the intricate SC-FC interrelationship. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel physics-guided deep learning framework that leverages a neural oscillation model to describe the dynamics of a collection of interconnected neural oscillators, which operate via nerve fibers dispersed across the brain's structure. Our proposed framework utilizes SC to simultaneously generate FC by learning SC-FC coupling from a system dynamics perspective. Additionally, it employs a novel multi-view graph neural network (GNN) with a joint loss to perform correlation-based SC-FC fusion and classification of individuals with SZ. Experiments conducted on a clinical dataset exhibited improved performance, demonstrating the robustness of our proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: Predictive Intelligence in Medicine (PRIME 2024), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 15155.

Existing approaches often fail to fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI).

Nevertheless, most of the traditional multimodal deep learning approaches fail to fully leverage the complementary characteristics of structural and functional connectomics data to enhance diagnostic performance. To address this issue, we proposed ConneX, a multimodal fusion method that integrates cross-attention mechanism and multilayer perceptron (MLP)-Mixer for refined feature fusion. Modality-specific backbone graph neural networks (GNNs) were firstly employed to obtain feature representation for each modality. A unified cross-modal attention network was then introduced to fuse these embeddings by capturing intra- and inter-modal interactions, while MLP-Mixer layers refined global and local features, leveraging higher-order dependencies for end-to-end classification with a multi-head joint loss. Extensive evaluations demonstrated improved performance on two distinct clinical datasets, highlighting the robustness of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC 2025).

| **[Identifying and Correcting Label Noise for Robust GNNs via Influence Contradiction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17469v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable capabilities in learning from graph-structured data with various applications such as social analysis and bioinformatics. However, the presence of label noise in real scenarios poses a significant challenge in learning robust GNNs, and their effectiveness can be severely impacted when dealing with noisy labels on graphs, often stemming from annotation errors or inconsistencies. To address this, in this paper we propose a novel approach called ICGNN that harnesses the structure information of the graph to effectively alleviate the challenges posed by noisy labels. Specifically, we first design a novel noise indicator that measures the influence contradiction score (ICS) based on the graph diffusion matrix to quantify the credibility of nodes with clean labels, such that nodes with higher ICS values are more likely to be detected as having noisy labels. Then we leverage the Gaussian mixture model to precisely detect whether the label of a node is noisy or not. Additionally, we develop a soft strategy to combine the predictions from neighboring nodes on the graph to correct the detected noisy labels. At last, pseudo-labeling for abundant unlabeled nodes is incorporated to provide auxiliary supervision signals and guide the model optimization. Experiments on benchmark datasets show the superiority of our proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[DREAM: Dual-Standard Semantic Homogeneity with Dynamic Optimization for Graph Learning with Label Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17449v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various graph machine learning scenarios. Existing literature primarily assumes well-annotated training graphs, while the reliability of labels is not guaranteed in real-world scenarios. Recently, efforts have been made to address the problem of graph learning with label noise. However, existing methods often (i) struggle to distinguish between reliable and unreliable nodes, and (ii) overlook the relational information embedded in the graph topology. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel method, Dual-Standard Semantic Homogeneity with Dynamic Optimization (DREAM), for reliable, relation-informed optimization on graphs with label noise. Specifically, we design a relation-informed dynamic optimization framework that iteratively reevaluates the reliability of each labeled node in the graph during the optimization process according to the relation of the target node and other nodes. To measure this relation comprehensively, we propose a dual-standard selection strategy that selects a set of anchor nodes based on both node proximity and graph topology. Subsequently, we compute the semantic homogeneity between the target node and the anchor nodes, which serves as guidance for optimization. We also provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to justify the design of DREAM. Extensive experiments are performed on six graph datasets across various domains under three types of graph label noise against competing baselines, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DREAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Make LMs Strong Node Classifiers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02296v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) are increasingly challenging the dominance of domain-specific models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers (GTs), in graph learning tasks. Following this trend, we propose a novel approach that empowers off-the-shelf LMs to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNNs on node classification tasks, without requiring any architectural modification. By preserving the LM's original architecture, our approach retains a key benefit of LM instruction tuning: the ability to jointly train on diverse datasets, fostering greater flexibility and efficiency. To achieve this, we introduce two key augmentation strategies: (1) Enriching LMs' input using topological and semantic retrieval methods, which provide richer contextual information, and (2) guiding the LMs' classification process through a lightweight GNN classifier that effectively prunes class candidates. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that backbone Flan-T5 LMs equipped with these augmentation strategies outperform SOTA text-output node classifiers and are comparable to top-performing vector-output node classifiers. By bridging the gap between specialized node classifiers and general LMs, this work paves the way for more versatile and widely applicable graph learning models. We will open-source the code upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[How does Graph Structure Modulate Membership-Inference Risk for Graph Neural Networks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17130v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the standard tool for encoding data and their complex relationships into continuous representations, improving prediction accuracy in several machine learning tasks like node classification and link prediction. However, their use in sensitive applications has raised concerns about the potential leakage of training data. Research on privacy leakage in GNNs has largely been shaped by findings from non-graph domains, such as images and tabular data. We emphasize the need of graph specific analysis and investigate the impact of graph structure on node level membership inference. We formalize MI over node-neighbourhood tuples and investigate two important dimensions: (i) training graph construction and (ii) inference-time edge access. Empirically, snowball's coverage bias often harms generalisation relative to random sampling, while enabling inter-train-test edges at inference improves test accuracy, shrinks the train-test gap, and yields the lowest membership advantage across most of the models and datasets. We further show that the generalisation gap empirically measured as the performance difference between the train and test nodes is an incomplete proxy for MI risk: access to edges dominates-MI can rise or fall independent of gap changes. Finally, we examine the auditability of differentially private GNNs, adapting the definition of statistical exchangeability of train-test data points for graph based models. We show that for node level tasks the inductive splits (random or snowball sampled) break exchangeability, limiting the applicability of standard bounds for membership advantage of differential private models.</p></details> |  |

HEGNNs generalize subgraph-GNNs and form a hierarchy of increasingly expressive models that, in the limit, distinguish graphs up to isomorphism. We show that, over graphs of bounded degree, the separating power of HEGNN node classifiers equals that of graded hybrid logic. This characterization enables us to relate the separating power of HEGNNs to that of higher-order GNNs, GNNs enriched with local homomorphism count features, and color refinement algorithms based on Individualization-Refinement. Our experimental results confirm the practical feasibility of HEGNNs and show benefits in comparison with traditional GNN architectures, both with and without local homomorphism count features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2025, 28 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[E2Former-V2: On-the-Fly Equivariant Attention with Linear Activation Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16622v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have become a widely used approach for modeling 3D atomistic systems. However, mainstream architectures face critical scalability bottlenecks due to the explicit construction of geometric features or dense tensor products on \textit{every} edge. To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{E2Former-V2}, a scalable architecture that integrates algebraic sparsity with hardware-aware execution. We first propose \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{A}xis-\textbf{A}ligned \textbf{S}parsification (EAAS). EAAS builds on Wigner-$6j$ convolution by exploiting an $\mathrm{SO}(3) \rightarrow \mathrm{SO}(2)$ change of basis to transform computationally expensive dense tensor contractions into efficient, sparse parity re-indexing operations. Building on this representation, we introduce \textbf{On-the-Fly Equivariant Attention}, a fully node-centric mechanism implemented via a custom fused Triton kernel. By eliminating materialized edge tensors and maximizing SRAM utilization, our kernel achieves a \textbf{20$\times$ improvement in TFLOPS} compared to standard implementations. Extensive experiments on the SPICE and OMol25 datasets demonstrate that E2Former-V2 maintains comparable predictive performance while notably accelerating inference. This work demonstrates that large equivariant transformers can be trained efficiently using widely accessible GPU platforms. The code is avalible at https://github.com/IQuestLab/UBio-MolFM/tree/e2formerv2.</p></details> |  |

While existing FGL methods often achieve high overall accuracy, we show that this average performance can conceal severe degradation on disadvantaged node groups. From a fairness perspective, these disparities arise systematically from three coupled sources: label skew toward majority patterns, topology confounding in message propagation, and aggregation dilution of updates from hard clients. To address this, we propose \textbf{BoostFGL}, a boosting-style framework for fairness-aware FGL. BoostFGL introduces three coordinated mechanisms: \ding{182} \emph{Client-side node boosting}, which reshapes local training signals to emphasize systematically under-served nodes; \ding{183} \emph{Client-side topology boosting}, which reallocates propagation emphasis toward reliable yet underused structures and attenuates misleading neighborhoods; and \ding{184} \emph{Server-side model boosting}, which performs difficulty- and reliability-aware aggregation to preserve informative updates from hard clients while stabilizing the global model. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets show that BoostFGL delivers substantial fairness gains, improving Overall-F1 by 8.43\%, while preserving competitive overall performance against strong FGL baselines.</p></details> |  |

For a comprehensive analysis, the multi-modal images require pixel-wise alignment, which is still often performed manually. Multi-modal image registration can reduce this laborious manual work, is substantially faster, and enables higher precision. Due to varying image resolutions, huge image sizes, non-rigid distortions, and modality-dependent image content, registration is challenging. Therefore, we propose a coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration method efficiently relying on sparse keypoints and thin-plate-splines. Historical paintings exhibit a fine crack pattern, called craquelure, on the paint layer, which is captured by all image systems and is well-suited as a feature for registration. In our one-stage non-rigid registration approach, we employ a convolutional neural network for joint keypoint detection and description based on the craquelure and a graph neural network for descriptor matching in a patch-based manner, and filter matches based on homography reprojection errors in local areas. For coarse-to-fine registration, we introduce a novel multi-level keypoint refinement approach to register mixed-resolution images up to the highest resolution. We created a multi-modal dataset of panel paintings with a high number of keypoint annotations, and a large test set comprising five multi-modal domains and varying image resolutions. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of all modules of our refinement method. Our proposed approaches achieve the best registration results compared to competing keypoint and dense matching methods and refinement methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, submitted for review</p></details> |
| **[Predicting Healthcare System Visitation Flow by Integrating Hospital Attributes and Population Socioeconomics with Human Mobility Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15977v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare visitation patterns are influenced by a complex interplay of hospital attributes, population socioeconomics, and spatial factors. However, existing research often adopts a fragmented approach, examining these determinants in isolation. This study addresses this gap by integrating hospital capacities, occupancy rates, reputation, and popularity with population SES and spatial mobility patterns to predict visitation flows and analyze influencing factors. Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services.</p></details> |  |

We draw interest in (i) ML methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of GNN. Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of RL, and in particular that of multiagent deep reinforcement learning. Single-agent deep RL has been widely used for decision making in demanding game settings. Its application in multiagent settings though is hindered due to, e.g., varying relationships between agents, and non-stationarity of the environment. We describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts, and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes probabilistic topic modeling (PTM) in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. Finally, we identify certain open challenges -- specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.</p></details> | 28 pages |

Federated GNNs (FGNNs) have emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm for training GNNs over decentralized data. However, FGNNs face two significant challenges: high communication overhead from multiple rounds of parameter exchanges and non-IID data characteristics across clients. To address these issues, we introduce CeFGC, a novel FGNN paradigm that facilitates efficient GNN training over non-IID data by limiting communication between the server and clients to three rounds only. The core idea of CeFGC is to leverage generative diffusion models to minimize direct client-server communication. Each client trains a generative diffusion model that captures its local graph distribution and shares this model with the server, which then redistributes it back to all clients. Using these generative models, clients generate synthetic graphs combined with their local graphs to train local GNN models. Finally, clients upload their model weights to the server for aggregation into a global GNN model. We theoretically analyze the I/O complexity of communication volume to show that CeFGC reduces to a constant of three communication rounds only. Extensive experiments on several real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CeFGC against state-of-the-art competitors, reflecting our superior performance on non-IID graphs by aligning local and global model objectives and enriching the training set with diverse graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Code Analysis via Graph-Guided Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12890v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code analysis tasks, yet they struggle to detect malicious behaviors fragmented across files, whose intricate dependencies easily get lost in the vast amount of benign code. We therefore propose a graph-centric attention acquisition pipeline that enhances LLMs' ability to localize malicious behavior. The approach parses a project into a code graph, uses an LLM to encode nodes with semantic and structural signals, and trains a Graph Neural Network (GNN) under sparse supervision. The GNN performs an initial detection, and by interpreting these predictions, identifies key code sections that are most likely to contain malicious behavior. These influential regions are then used to guide the LLM's attention for in-depth analysis. This strategy significantly reduces interference from irrelevant context while maintaining low annotation costs. Extensive experiments show that the method consistently outperforms existing approaches on multiple public and custom datasets, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in software security scenarios.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-Targeted Graph Backdoor Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15474v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network (GNN) have demonstrated exceptional performance in solving critical problems across diverse domains yet remain susceptible to backdoor attacks. Existing studies on backdoor attack for graph classification are limited to single target attack using subgraph replacement based mechanism where the attacker implants only one trigger into the GNN model. In this paper, we introduce the first multi-targeted backdoor attack for graph classification task, where multiple triggers simultaneously redirect predictions to different target labels. Instead of subgraph replacement, we propose subgraph injection which preserves the structure of the original graphs while poisoning the clean graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, where our attack achieves high attack success rates for all target labels with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Experimental results on five dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our attack framework compared to the conventional subgraph replacement-based attack. Our analysis on four GNN models confirms the generalization capability of our attack which is effective regardless of the GNN model architectures and training parameters settings. We further investigate the impact of the attack design parameters including injection methods, number of connections, trigger sizes, trigger edge density and poisoning ratios. Additionally, our evaluation against state-of-the-art defenses (randomized smoothing and fine-pruning) demonstrates the robustness of our proposed multi-target attacks. This work highlights the GNN vulnerability against multi-targeted backdoor attack in graph classification task. Our source codes will be available at https://github.com/SiSL-URI/Multi-Targeted-Graph-Backdoor-Attack.</p></details> |  |

However, this can cause overreliance on surface-level labels and impede cross-type knowledge transfer. We explore integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into HGNNs--a direction underexplored despite MoE's success in homogeneous settings. Crucially, we question the need for type-specific experts. We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics. Our work demonstrates that regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations--a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has been withdrawn by the authors due to significant revisions in preparation for conference submission.

However, conventional physics-based methods remain computationally expensive, hindering their application in time-sensitive scenarios. While graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising acceleration, existing approaches exhibit poor cross-resolution generalisation, demonstrating significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond the training distribution. This stems from two key factors: (1) existing GNNs employ fixed message-passing depth that fails to adapt information aggregation to mesh density variation, and (2) vertex-wise displacement magnitudes are inherently resolution-dependent in garment simulation. To address these issues, we introduce Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet), a resolution-adaptive framework that decouples message propagation from feature updates. Pb4U-GNet incorporates two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control, adjusting message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling, which scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics. Extensive experiments show that even trained solely on low-resolution meshes, Pb4U-GNet exhibits strong generalisability across diverse mesh resolutions, addressing a fundamental challenge in neural garment simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

GNN quantization has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and accelerating inference in resource-constrained environments. Compared to quantization in LLMs, quantizing graph features is more emphasized in GNNs. Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Transformer-GNN for Privacy-Preserving Brain Tumor Localization with Modality-Level Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15042v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models for brain tumor analysis require large and diverse datasets that are often siloed across healthcare institutions due to privacy regulations. We present a federated learning framework for brain tumor localization that enables multi-institutional collaboration without sharing sensitive patient data. Our method extends a hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network architecture derived from prior decoder-free supervoxel GNNs and is deployed within CAFEIN\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, CERN's federated learning platform designed for healthcare environments. We provide an explainability analysis through Transformer attention mechanisms that reveals which MRI modalities drive the model predictions. Experiments on the BraTS dataset demonstrate a key finding: while isolated training on individual client data triggers early stopping well before reaching full training capacity, federated learning enables continued model improvement by leveraging distributed data, ultimately matching centralized performance. This result provides strong justification for federated learning when dealing with complex tasks and high-dimensional input data, as aggregating knowledge from multiple institutions significantly benefits the learning process. Our explainability analysis, validated through rigorous statistical testing on the full test set (paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction), reveals that deeper network layers significantly increase attention to T2 and FLAIR modalities ($p<0.001$, Cohen's $d$=1.50), aligning with clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

This report presents the ExPrIS project, which addresses this challenge by investigating how knowledge-level expectations can serve as to improve object interpretation from sensor data. Our approach is based on the incremental construction of a 3D Semantic Scene Graph (3DSSG). We integrate expectations from two sources: contextual priors from past observations and semantic knowledge from external graphs like ConceptNet. These are embedded into a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) to create an expectation-biased inference process. This method moves beyond static, frame-by-frame analysis to enhance the robustness and consistency of scene understanding over time. The report details this architecture, its evaluation, and outlines its planned integration on a mobile robotic platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

However, their computational cost becomes prohibitive for repeated queries and large-scale 3D scenarios. Recent purely data-driven networks improve efficiency, yet they often bypass this scattering mechanism, which may compromise physical consistency and generalization. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose U-PINet, a fully end-to-end, physics-informed hierarchical network for efficient RCS prediction via 3D electromagnetic scattering reconstruction. Once the scattering quantities are reconstructed, scattered fields and RCS can be evaluated for arbitrary observation directions via the radiation integral. U-PINet explicitly learns physics-consistent intermediate scattering representations by modeling local electromagnetic coupling and long-range radiation effects through a hierarchical operator design inspired by near-far field decomposition in fast solvers. A physics-guided graph neural network is incorporated to capture self- and mutual-coupling among mesh elements of complex targets, enabling physically interpretable intermediate representations. By embedding governing equations as residual constraints, U-PINet enables accurate object reconstruction of scattering quantities and consequently reliable RCS prediction across observation directions, while significantly reducing runtime. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that U-PINet achieves EM-solver-level RCS accuracy and 3D object reconstruction with orders-of-magnitude speedups, and generalizes well to unseen geometries under limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to an Elsevier Journal</p></details> |

Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.</p></details> | 29p, 22 figures |
| **[FSX: Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14730v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), understanding the reasons behind their specific predictions remains challenging. Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, Preprint</p></details> |
| **[PULSE: Socially-Aware User Representation Modeling Toward Parameter-Efficient Graph Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14720v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based social recommendation (SocialRec) has emerged as a powerful extension of graph collaborative filtering (GCF), which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture multi-hop collaborative signals from user-item interactions. These methods enrich user representations by incorporating social network information into GCF, thereby integrating additional collaborative signals from social relations. However, existing GCF and graph-based SocialRec approaches face significant challenges: they incur high computational costs and suffer from limited scalability due to the large number of parameters required to assign explicit embeddings to all users and items. In this work, we propose PULSE (Parameter-efficient User representation Learning with Social Knowledge), a framework that addresses this limitation by constructing user representations from socially meaningful signals without creating an explicit learnable embedding for each user. PULSE reduces the parameter size by up to 50% compared to the most lightweight GCF baseline. Beyond parameter efficiency, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming 13 GCF and graph-based social recommendation baselines across varying levels of interaction sparsity, from cold-start to highly active users, through a time- and memory-efficient modeling process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WWW 2026, 12pages</p></details> |

Classical heuristics struggle with workload irregularity, tabular regressors discard structural information, and model-free reinforcement learning (RL) risks overheating. We introduce GraphPerf-RT, a graph neural network surrogate achieving deep learning accuracy at heuristic speeds (2-7ms). GraphPerf-RT is, to our knowledge, the first to unify task DAG topology, CFG-derived code semantics, and runtime context (per-core DVFS, thermal state, utilization) in a heterogeneous graph with typed edges encoding precedence, placement, and contention. Evidential regression with Normal-Inverse-Gamma priors provides calibrated uncertainty; we validate on makespan prediction for risk-aware scheduling. Experiments on three ARM platforms (Jetson TX2, Orin NX, RUBIK Pi) achieve R^2 = 0.81 on log-transformed makespan with Spearman rho = 0.95 and conservative uncertainty calibration (PICP = 99.9% at 95% confidence). Integration with four RL methods demonstrates that multi-agent model-based RL with GraphPerf-RT as the world model achieves 66% makespan reduction and 82% energy reduction versus model-free baselines, with zero thermal violations.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 4 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |

However, existing GU methods lack a clear understanding of the key factors that determine unlearning effectiveness, leading to three fundamental limitations: (1) impractical and inaccurate GU difficulty assessment due to test-access requirements and invalid assumptions, (2) ineffectiveness on hard-to-unlearn tasks, and (3) misaligned evaluation protocols that overemphasize easy tasks and fail to capture true forgetting capability. To address these issues, we establish GNN memorization as a new perspective for understanding graph unlearning and propose MGU, a Memorization-guided Graph Unlearning framework. MGU achieves three key advances: it provides accurate and practical difficulty assessment across different GU tasks, develops an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts unlearning objectives based on difficulty levels, and establishes a comprehensive evaluation protocol that aligns with practical requirements. Extensive experiments on ten real-world graphs demonstrate that MGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forgetting quality, computational efficiency, and utility preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by WWW-2026</p></details> |

We show that graph-based machine learning emulators can learn the spatiotemporal evolution of electromagnetic fields and lower order moments of ion velocity distribution in the near-Earth space environment from four 5D Vlasiator runs performed with identical steady solar wind conditions. The initial ion number density is systematically varied, while the grid spacing is held constant, to scan the ratio of the characteristic ion skin depth to the numerical grid size. Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs. These results demonstrate that machine learning offers a way to make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for real-time use while providing forecast uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

While strong tabular models remain highly competitive in credit scoring, they may fail to explicitly capture cross-entity dependencies embedded in multi-table financial histories. In this work, we construct a massive-scale heterogeneous graph containing over 31 million nodes and more than 50 million edges, integrating borrower attributes with granular transaction-level entities such as installment payments, POS cash balances, and credit card histories. We evaluate heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs), including heterogeneous GraphSAGE and a relation-aware attentive heterogeneous GNN, against strong tabular baselines. We find that standalone GNNs provide limited lift over a competitive gradient-boosted tree baseline, while a hybrid ensemble that augments tabular features with GNN-derived customer embeddings achieves the best overall performance, improving both ROC-AUC and PR-AUC. We further observe that contrastive pretraining can improve optimization stability but yields limited downstream gains under generic graph augmentations. Finally, we conduct structured explainability and fairness analyses to characterize how relational signals affect subgroup behavior and screening-oriented outcomes.</p></details> |  |

However, their high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and intricate biological networks pose major challenges for reliable prediction and meaningful interpretation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability. Through extensive simulations and real-world applications to gene expression data, engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Beyond classification, engGNN provides interpretable feature importance scores that facilitate biologically meaningful discoveries, such as pathway enrichment analysis. Taken together, these results highlight engGNN as a robust, flexible, and interpretable framework for disease classification and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional omics contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Assembly Flow Graph (AFG) to comprehensively represent the assembly flow of a binary executable as graph data. Importantly, AFG can be used to extract granular explanations needed to increase transparency for malware detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, since AFGs may be large in practice, we also propose a Meta-Coarsening approach to improve computational tractability via graph reduction. To evaluate our proposed approach we consider several novel and existing metrics to quantify the granularity and quality of explanations. Lastly, we also consider several hyperparameters in our proposed Meta-Coarsening approach that can be used to control the final explanation size. We evaluate our proposed approach using the CIC-DGG-2025 dataset. Our results indicate that our proposed AFG and Meta-Coarsening approach can provide both increased explainability and inference performance at certain coarsening levels. However, most importantly, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider granular explainability in malware detection using GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02600v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces, struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training, we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover, the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The Fortieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26), Main Technical Track</p></details> |

This limitation introduces significant geometric distortion when representing real-world graphs with inherent non-Euclidean structures (e.g., hierarchies and cycles), degrading representation quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

Existing multimodal methods typically fuse Natural Code Sequence (NCS) representations extracted by pretrained models with Code Property Graph (CPG) representations extracted by graph neural networks, under the implicit assumption that introducing an additional modality necessarily yields information gain. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate the limitations of this assumption: pretrained models already encode substantial structural information implicitly, leading to strong overlap between the two modalities; moreover, graph encoders are generally less effective than pretrained language models in feature extraction. As a result, naive fusion not only struggles to obtain complementary signals but can also dilute effective discriminative cues due to noise propagation. To address these challenges, we propose a task-conditioned complementary fusion strategy that uses Fisher information to quantify task relevance, transforming cross-modal interaction from full-spectrum matching into selective fusion within a task-sensitive subspace. Our theoretical analysis shows that, under an isotropic perturbation assumption, this strategy significantly tightens the upper bound on the output error. Based on this insight, we design the TaCCS-DFA framework, which combines online low-rank Fisher subspace estimation with an adaptive gating mechanism to enable efficient task-oriented fusion. Experiments on the BigVul, Devign, and ReVeal benchmarks demonstrate that TaCCS-DFA delivers up to a 6.3-point gain in F1 score with only a 3.4% increase in inference latency, while maintaining low calibration error.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a Risk-Aware Dynamic Routing(RADR) framework which integrates Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with combinatorial optimization. We first construct a logistics topology graph by using the discrete GPS data using spatial clustering methods. Subsequently, a hybrid deep learning model combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is adopted to extract spatial correlations and temporal dependencies for predicting future congestion risks. These prediction results are then integrated into a dynamic edge weight mechanism to perform path planning. We evaluated the framework on the Smart Logistics Dataset 2024, which contains real-world Internet of Things(IoT) sensor data. The experimental results show that the RADR algorithm significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain. Particularly in the case study of high congestion scenarios, our method reduces the potential congestion risk exposure by 19.3% while only increasing the transportation distance by 2.1%. This empirical evidence confirms that the proposed data-driven approach can effectively balance delivery efficiency and operational safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks are Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13465v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that a single training trajectory can transform a graph neural network into an unsupervised heuristic for combinatorial optimization. Focusing on the Travelling Salesman Problem, we show that encoding global structural constraints as an inductive bias enables a non-autoregressive model to generate solutions via direct forward passes, without search, supervision, or sequential decision-making. At inference time, dropout and snapshot ensembling allow a single model to act as an implicit ensemble, reducing optimality gaps through increased solution diversity. Our results establish that graph neural networks do not require supervised training nor explicit search to be effective. Instead, they can internalize global combinatorial structure and function as strong, learned heuristics. This reframes the role of learning in combinatorial optimization: from augmenting classical algorithms to directly instantiating new heuristics.</p></details> |  |

Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction. There are two key technical components in TrustEnergy, (i) a Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Representation module to efficiently capture both macro and micro energy usage patterns with a novel memory-augmented spatiotemporal graph neural network, and (ii) an innovative Sequential Conformalized Quantile Regression module to dynamically adjust uncertainty bounds to ensure valid prediction intervals over time, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We implement and evaluate our TrustEnergy framework by working with an electricity provider in Florida, and the results show our TrustEnergy can achieve a 5.4% increase in prediction accuracy and 5.7% improvement in uncertainty quantification compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conflict Detection in AI-RAN: Efficient Interaction Learning and Autonomous Graph Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13213v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native mobile networks represent a fundamental step toward 6G, where learning, inference, and decision making are embedded into the Radio Access Network (RAN) itself. In such networks, multiple AI agents optimize the network to achieve distinct and often competing objectives. As such, conflicts become inevitable and have the potential to degrade performance, cause instability, and disrupt service. Current approaches for conflict detection rely on conflict graphs created based on relationships between AI agents, parameters, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Existing works often rely on complex and computationally expensive Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and depend on manually chosen thresholds to create conflict graphs. In this work, we present the first systematic framework for conflict detection in AI-native mobile networks, propose a two-tower encoder architecture for learning interactions based on data from the RAN, and introduce a data-driven sparsity-based mechanism for autonomously reconstructing conflict graphs without manual fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vejde: A Framework for Inductive Deep Reinforcement Learning Based on Factor Graph Color Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09219v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction, graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL, with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score. Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[HT-GNN: Hyper-Temporal Graph Neural Network for Customer Lifetime Value Prediction in Baidu Ads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13013v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifetime value (LTV) prediction is crucial for news feed advertising, enabling platforms to optimize bidding and budget allocation for long-term revenue growth. However, it faces two major challenges: (1) demographic-based targeting creates segment-specific LTV distributions with large value variations across user groups; and (2) dynamic marketing strategies generate irregular behavioral sequences where engagement patterns evolve rapidly. We propose a Hyper-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HT-GNN), which jointly models demographic heterogeneity and temporal dynamics through three key components: (i) a hypergraph-supervised module capturing inter-segment relationships; (ii) a transformer-based temporal encoder with adaptive weighting; and (iii) a task-adaptive mixture-of-experts with dynamic prediction towers for multi-horizon LTV forecasting. Experiments on \textit{Baidu Ads} with 15 million users demonstrate that HT-GNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics and prediction horizons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Sparse Circuit Extraction from Billion-Parameter Language Models through Scalable Attribution Graph Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12879v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanistic interpretability seeks to reverse-engineer neural network computations into human-understandable algorithms, yet extracting sparse computational circuits from billion-parameter language models remains challenging due to exponential search complexity and pervasive polysemanticity. The proposed Hierarchical Attribution Graph Decomposition (HAGD) framework reduces circuit discovery complexity from O(2^n) exhaustive enumeration to O(n^2 log n) through multi-resolution abstraction hierarchies and differentiable circuit search. The methodology integrates cross-layer transcoders for monosemantic feature extraction, graph neural network meta-learning for topology prediction, and causal intervention protocols for validation. Empirical evaluation spans GPT-2 variants, Llama-7B through Llama-70B, and Pythia suite models across algorithmic tasks and natural language benchmarks. On modular arithmetic tasks, the framework achieves up to 91% behavioral preservation ($\pm$2.3\% across runs) while maintaining interpretable subgraph sizes. Cross-architecture transfer experiments suggest that discovered circuits exhibit moderate structural similarity (averaging 67%) across model families, indicating potential shared computational patterns. These results provide preliminary foundations for interpretability at larger model scales while identifying significant limitations in current attribution methodologies that require future advances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Integrated Representation Learning for Crypto Anomaly Detection under Extreme Label Scarcity; Relational Domain-Logic Integration with Retrieval-Grounded Context and Path-Level Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12839v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalous trajectories in decentralized crypto networks is fundamentally challenged by extreme label scarcity and the adaptive evasion strategies of illicit actors. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they struggle to internalize multi hop, logic driven motifs such as fund dispersal and layering that characterize sophisticated money laundering, limiting their forensic accountability under regulations like the FATF Travel Rule. To address this limitation, we propose Relational Domain Logic Integration (RDLI), a framework that embeds expert derived heuristics as differentiable, logic aware latent signals within representation learning. Unlike static rule based approaches, RDLI enables the detection of complex transactional flows that evade standard message passing. To further account for market volatility, we incorporate a Retrieval Grounded Context (RGC) module that conditions anomaly scoring on regulatory and macroeconomic context, mitigating false positives caused by benign regime shifts. Under extreme label scarcity (0.01%), RDLI outperforms state of the art GNN baselines by 28.9% in F1 score. A micro expert user study further confirms that RDLI path level explanations significantly improve trustworthiness, perceived usefulness, and clarity compared to existing methods, highlighting the importance of integrating domain logic with contextual grounding for both accuracy and explainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Gyuye...</summary><p>Gyuyeon Na, Minjung Park, Soyoun Kim contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[Eddy-Resolving Global Ocean Forecasting with Multi-Scale Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12775v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on data-driven ocean models has progressed rapidly in recent years; however, the application of these models to global eddy-resolving ocean forecasting remains limited. The accurate representation of ocean dynamics across a wide range of spatial scales remains a major challenge in such applications. This study proposes a multi-scale graph neural network-based ocean model for 10-day global forecasting that improves short-term prediction skill and enhances the representation of multi-scale ocean variability. The model employs an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and uses two spherical meshes with different resolutions to better capture the multi-scale nature of ocean dynamics. In addition, the model incorporates surface atmospheric variables along with ocean state variables as node inputs to improve short-term prediction accuracy by representing atmospheric forcing. Evaluation using surface kinetic energy spectra and case studies shows that the model accurately represents a broad range of spatial scales, while root mean square error comparisons demonstrate improved skill in short-term predictions. These results indicate that the proposed model delivers more accurate short-term forecasts and improved representation of multi-scale ocean dynamics, thereby highlighting its potential to advance data-driven, eddy-resolving global ocean forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Boolean Function-Theoretic Framework for Expressivity in GNNs with Applications to Fair Graph Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12751v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel expressivity framework for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) grounded in Boolean function theory, enabling a fine-grained analysis of their ability to capture complex subpopulation structures. We introduce the notion of \textit{Subpopulation Boolean Isomorphism} (SBI) as an invariant that strictly subsumes existing expressivity measures such as Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL), biconnectivity-based, and homomorphism-based frameworks. Our theoretical results identify Fourier degree, circuit class (AC$^0$, NC$^1$), and influence as key barriers to expressivity in fairness-aware GNNs. We design a circuit-traversal-based fairness algorithm capable of handling subpopulations defined by high-complexity Boolean functions, such as parity, which break existing baselines. Experiments on real-world graphs show that our method achieves low fairness gaps across intersectional groups where state-of-the-art methods fail, providing the first principled treatment of GNN expressivity tailored to fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Graph Prompt Fine-Tuning Method for WSN Spatio-Temporal Correlation Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12745v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection of multi-temporal modal data in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can provide an important guarantee for reliable network operation. Existing anomaly detection methods in multi-temporal modal data scenarios have the problems of insufficient extraction of spatio-temporal correlation features, high cost of anomaly sample category annotation, and imbalance of anomaly samples. In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of "pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning "pre-training" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning. The model is fine-tuned through the "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning model to complete the parameter fine-tuning, thereby reducing the training cost and enhancing the detection generalization performance. The F1 metrics obtained from experiments on the public dataset and the actual collected dataset are up to 91.30% and 92.31%, respectively, which provides better detection performance and generalization ability than existing methods designed by the method.</p></details> |  |
| **[MiCA: A Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter for Lightweight Epidemic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11089v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of infectious disease dynamics is critical for public health planning and intervention. Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records. Meanwhile, epidemic case time series are typically short and reported at coarse temporal resolution. These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\% across forecasting horizons. Moreover, MiCA attains performance competitive with SOTA spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology-Aware Multiscale Mixture of Experts for Efficient Molecular Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12637v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many molecular properties depend on 3D geometry, where non-covalent interactions, stereochemical effects, and medium- to long-range forces are determined by spatial distances and angles that cannot be uniquely captured by a 2D bond graph. Yet most 3D molecular graph neural networks still rely on globally fixed neighborhood heuristics, typically defined by distance cutoffs and maximum neighbor limits, to define local message-passing neighborhoods, leading to rigid, data-agnostic interaction budgets. We propose Multiscale Interaction Mixture of Experts (MI-MoE) to adapt interaction modeling across geometric regimes. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a distance-cutoff expert ensemble that explicitly captures short-, mid-, and long-range interactions without committing to a single cutoff; (2) we design a topological gating encoder that routes inputs to experts using filtration-based descriptors, including persistent homology features, summarizing how connectivity evolves across radii; and (3) we show that MI-MoE is a plug-in module that consistently improves multiple strong 3D molecular backbones across diverse molecular and polymer property prediction benchmark datasets, covering both regression and classification tasks. These results highlight topology-aware multiscale routing as an effective principle for 3D molecular graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Despite its importance, finding the most frequent induced subgraph remains computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the subgraph counting task. Traditional exact enumeration algorithms often suffer from high time complexity, especially for a large graph size $k$. To mitigate this, existing approaches often utilize frequency measurement with the Downward Closure Property to reduce the search space, imposing additional constraints on the task. In this paper, we first formulate this task as a Markov Decision Process and approach it using a multi-task reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we introduce RLMiner, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with our proposed task-state-aware Graph Neural Network to find the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ with a time complexity linear to $k$. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed RLMiner effectively identifies subgraphs with frequencies closely matching the ground-truth most frequent induced subgraphs, while achieving significantly shorter and more stable running times compared to traditional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[RIPPLE++: An Incremental Framework for Efficient GNN Inference on Evolving Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12347v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graphs are dynamic, with frequent updates to their structure and features due to evolving vertex and edge properties. These continual changes pose significant challenges for efficient inference in graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing vertex-wise and layer-wise inference approaches are ill-suited for dynamic graphs, as they incur redundant computations, large neighborhood traversals, and high communication costs, especially in distributed settings. Additionally, while sampling-based approaches can be adopted to approximate final layer embeddings, these are often not preferred in critical applications due to their non-determinism. These limitations hinder low-latency inference required in real-time applications. To address this, we propose RIPPLE++, a framework for streaming GNN inference that efficiently and accurately updates embeddings in response to changes in the graph structure or features. RIPPLE++ introduces a generalized incremental programming model that captures the semantics of GNN aggregation functions and incrementally propagates updates to affected neighborhoods. RIPPLE++ accommodates all common graph updates, including vertex/edge addition/deletions and vertex feature updates. RIPPLE++ supports both single-machine and distributed deployments. On a single machine, it achieves up to $56$K updates/sec on sparse graphs like Arxiv ($169$K vertices, $1.2$M edges), and about $7.6$K updates/sec on denser graphs like Products ($2.5$M vertices, $123.7$M edges), with latencies of $0.06$--$960$ms, and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by $2.2$--$24\times$ on throughput. In distributed settings, RIPPLE++ offers up to $\approx25\times$ higher throughput and $20\times$ lower communication costs compared to recomputing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended full-length version of paper that appeared at ICDCS 2025: "RIPPLE: Scalable Incremental GNN Inferencing on Large Streaming Graphs", Pranjal Naman and Yogesh Simmhan, in International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS), 2025.

| **[GNN2R: Weakly-Supervised Rationale-Providing Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02317v4)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), knowledge graph-based question answering (KGQA) remains essential for producing verifiable and hallucination-resistant answers in many real-world settings where answer trustworthiness and computational efficiency are highly valued. However, most existing KGQA methods provide only final answers in the form of KG entities. Without explicit explanations -- ideally in the form of intermediate reasoning process over relevant KG triples, the QA results are difficult to inspect and interpret. Moreover, this limitation prevents the rich and verifiable knowledge encoded in KGs, which is a key advantage of KGQA over LLMs, from being fully leveraged. However, addressing this issue remains highly challenging due to the lack of annotated intermediate reasoning process and the requirement of high efficiency in KGQA. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network-based Two-Step Reasoning method (GNN2R) that can efficiently retrieve both final answers and corresponding reasoning subgraphs as verifiable rationales, using only weak supervision from widely-available final answer annotations. We extensively evaluated GNN2R and demonstrated that GNN2R substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art KGQA methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and the quality of generated explanations. The complete code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ruijie-wang-uzh/GNN2R.</p></details> |  |

As AD and FTD propagate along white-matter regions in a global, graph-dependent manner, graph-based neural networks are well suited to capture these patterns. Hence, we introduce ARMARecon, a unified graph learning framework that integrates Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) graph filtering with a reconstruction-driven objective to enhance feature representation and improve classification accuracy. ARMARecon effectively models both local and global connectivity by leveraging 20-bin Fractional Anisotropy (FA) histogram features extracted from white-matter regions, while mitigating over-smoothing. Overall, ARMARecon achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on the multi-site dMRI datasets ADNI and NIFD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2026</p></details> |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have become mainstream approaches in this area. However, existing methods still face three major challenges. First, the sheer volume of social media messages makes learning resource-intensive. Second, the fragmentation of social media messages often impedes the model's ability to capture a comprehensive view of the events. Third, the lack of structured temporal context has hindered the development of effective models for event evolution, limiting users' access to event information. To address these challenges, we propose a foundation model for unsupervised Social Event Detection and Evolution, namely RagSEDE. Specifically, RagSEDE introduces a representativeness- and diversity-driven sampling strategy to extract key messages from massive social streams, significantly reducing noise and computational overhead. It further establishes a novel paradigm based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that enhances PLMs in detecting events while simultaneously constructing and maintaining an evolving event knowledge base. Finally, RagSEDE leverages structural information theory to dynamically model event evolution keywords for the first time. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of RagSEDE in open-world social event detection and evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, accepted for The Web Conference (WWW) 2026</p></details> |

Among operational loads, traffic load plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation. To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.</p></details> |  |

Convolutional feature maps are reinterpreted as patch-level graphs, where nodes encode both appearance and spatial coordinates, and edges reflect local structural adjacency. Unlike conventional graph neural networks that rely on generic message passing, we introduce a custom structural propagation mechanism that explicitly models relative spatial relations as part of the reasoning process. This design enables the graph to act as an inductive bias for structured inference rather than a passive relational representation. The proposed model jointly supports node-level lesion-aware predictions and graph-level diagnostic reasoning, yielding intrinsic explainability through learned node importance scores without relying on post-hoc visualization techniques. We demonstrate the approach through a chest X-ray case study, illustrating how structural priors guide relational reasoning and improve interpretability. While evaluated in a medical imaging context, the framework is domain-agnostic and aligns with the broader vision of graph-based reasoning across artificial intelligence systems. This work contributes to the growing body of research exploring graphs as computational substrates for structure-aware and explainable learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus of care prediction as a structured learning problem. In addition, we propose a new approach of obtaining an unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem. Experimental results with real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. Further, if we jointly finetune the base embedding fed into GRACE as input together with the rest of the GNN component of GRACE, there is a remarkable boost of 15.8% in performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Method for Detecting Spatio-temporal Correlation Anomalies of WSN Nodes Based on Topological Information Enhancement and Time-frequency Feature Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11951v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing anomaly detection methods for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) generally suffer from insufficient ex-traction of spatio-temporal correlation features, reliance on either time-domain or frequency-domain information alone, and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a topology-enhanced spatio-temporal feature fusion anomaly detection method, TE-MSTAD. First, building upon the RWKV model with linear attention mechanisms, a Cross-modal Feature Extraction (CFE) module is introduced to fully extract spatial correlation features among multiple nodes while reducing computational resource consumption. Second, a strategy is designed to construct an adjacency matrix by jointly learning spatial correlation from time-frequency domain features. Different graph neural networks are integrated to enhance spatial correlation feature extraction, thereby fully capturing spatial relationships among multiple nodes. Finally, a dual-branch network TE-MSTAD is designed for time-frequency domain feature fusion, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the time or frequency domain to improve WSN anomaly detection performance. Testing on both public and real-world datasets demonstrates that the TE-MSTAD model achieves F1 scores of 92.52% and 93.28%, respectively, exhibiting superior detection performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain.

| **[New Adaptive Mechanism for Large Neighborhood Search using Dual Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11414v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) is a widely used heuristic method for solving combinatorial optimization problems. ALNS explores the solution space by iteratively using destroy and repair operators with probabilities, which are adjusted by an adaptive mechanism to find optimal solutions. However, the classic ALNS adaptive mechanism does not consider the interaction between destroy and repair operators when selecting them. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a novel adaptive mechanism. This mechanism enhances the adaptability of the algorithm through a Dual Actor-Critic (DAC) model, which fully considers the fact that the quality of new solutions is jointly determined by the destroy and repair operators. It effectively utilizes the interaction between these operators during the weight adjustment process, greatly improving the adaptability of the ALNS algorithm. In this mechanism, the destroy and repair processes are modeled as independent Markov Decision Processes to guide the selection of operators more accurately. Furthermore, we use Graph Neural Networks to extract key features from problem instances and perform effective aggregation and normalization to enhance the algorithm's transferability to different sizes and characteristics of problems. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed DAC-ALNS algorithm significantly improves solution efficiency and exhibits excellent transferability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Factored Value Functions for Graph-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11401v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Credit assignment is a core challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), especially in large-scale systems with structured, local interactions. Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Networks for model order reduction of parameterized time-dependent PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11259v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for nonlinear Model Order Reduction (MOR) of time-dependent parameterized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, existing methodologies struggle to combine geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent behavior, overlooking dynamics-driven features or disregarding spatial information. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Network (LD-GCN), a purely data-driven, encoder-free architecture that learns a global, low-dimensional representation of dynamical systems conditioned on external inputs and parameters. The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation. The methodology is mathematically validated via a universal approximation theorem for encoder-free architectures, and numerically tested on complex computational mechanics problems involving physical and geometric parameters, including the detection of bifurcating phenomena for Navier-Stokes equations.

| **[Theoretically and Practically Efficient Resistance Distance Computation on Large Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11159v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computation of resistance distance is pivotal in a wide range of graph analysis applications, including graph clustering, link prediction, and graph neural networks. Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $κ$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $κ$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\tilde{O}(\sqrtκ m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\sqrtκ$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\tilde{O}(κ^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $κ^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Cognitive Neuroscience and Graph Intelligence: Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph Learning for Web Finance Fraud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11073v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online financial services constitute an essential component of contemporary web ecosystems, yet their openness introduces substantial exposure to fraud that harms vulnerable users and weakens trust in digital finance. Such threats have become a significant web harm that erodes societal fairness and affects the well being of online communities. However, existing detection methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with two persistent challenges: (1) fraud camouflage, where malicious transactions mimic benign behaviors to evade detection, and (2) long-tailed data distributions, which obscure rare but critical fraudulent cases. To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings. Extensive experiments on six web-based financial fraud datasets demonstrate that HIMVH achieves 6.42\% improvement in AUC, 9.74\% in F1 and 39.14\% in AP on average over 15 SOTA models.</p></details> |  |

We introduced KOCOBrain: KuramotO COupled Brain Graph Network; a unified graph neural network framework that integrates structural and functional connectomes via Kuramoto-based phase dynamics and cognition-aware attention. The Kuramoto layer models neural synchronization over anatomical connections, generating phase-informed embeddings that capture structure-function coupling, while cognitive scores modulate information routing in a subject-specific manner followed by a joint objective enhancing robustness under class imbalance scenario. Applied to the ABCD cohort, KOCOBrain improved prenatal drug exposure prediction over relevant baselines and revealed interpretable structure-function patterns that reflect disrupted brain network coordination associated with early exposure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version of the paper accepted to the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2026).

| **[A Low-Complexity Architecture for Multi-access Coded Caching Systems with Arbitrary User-cache Access Topology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10175v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the multi-access coded caching (MACC) problem under arbitrary user-cache access topologies, extending existing models that rely on highly structured and combinatorially designed connectivity. We consider a MACC system consisting of a single server, multiple cache nodes, and multiple user nodes. Each user can access an arbitrary subset of cache nodes to retrieve cached content. The objective is to design a general and low-complexity delivery scheme under fixed cache placement for arbitrary access topologies. We propose a universal graph-based framework for modeling the MACC delivery problem, where decoding conflicts among requested packets are captured by a conflict graph and the delivery design is reduced to a graph coloring problem. In this formulation, a lower transmission load corresponds to using fewer colors. The classical greedy coloring algorithm DSatur achieves a transmission load close to the index-coding converse bound, providing a tight benchmark, but its computational complexity becomes prohibitive for large-scale graphs. To overcome this limitation, we develop a learning-based framework using graph neural networks that efficiently constructs near-optimal coded multicast transmissions and generalizes across diverse access topologies and varying numbers of users. In addition, we extend the index-coding converse bound for uncoded cache placement to arbitrary access topologies and propose a low-complexity greedy approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based scheme achieves transmission loads close to those of DSatur and the converse bound while significantly reducing computational time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aggregating Direct and Indirect Neighbors through Graph Linear Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16871v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNN) typically rely on localized message passing, requiring increasing depth to capture long range dependencies. In this work, we introduce Graph Linear Transformations, a linear transformation that realizes direct and indirect feature mixing on graphs through a single, well-defined linear operator derived from the graph structure. By interpreting graphs as walk-summable Gaussian graphical models, we compute these transformations via Gaussian Belief Propagation, enabling each node to aggregate information from both direct and indirect neighbors without explicit enumeration of multi-hop paths. We show that different constructions of the underlying precision matrix induce distinct and interpretable propagation biases, ranging from selective edge-level interactions to uniform structural smoothing, and that Graph Linear Transformations can achieve competitive or superior performance compared to both local message-passing GNNs and dynamic neighborhood aggregation models across homophilic and heterophilic benchmark datasets.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 Figures |
| **[Superposition in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00928v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts. We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features, directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics. Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Homophily in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23773v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLGC: Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10358v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large graph datasets make training graph neural networks (GNNs) computationally costly. Graph condensation methods address this by generating small synthetic graphs that approximate the original data. However, existing approaches rely on clean, supervised labels, which limits their reliability when labels are scarce, noisy, or inconsistent. We propose Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation (PLGC), a self-supervised framework that constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match the original graph's structural and feature statistics -- without requiring ground-truth labels. PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin. Our findings highlight the practical and theoretical advantages of self-supervised graph condensation in noisy or weakly-labeled environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMPG: MoE-based Adaptive Multi-Perspective Graph Fusion for Protein Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10157v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted for Protein Representation Learning (PRL), as residue interaction networks can be naturally represented as graphs. Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attn-JGNN: Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15583v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks(Attn-JGNN) model for solving #SAT problems, which significantly improves the solving accuracy. Inspired by the Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, Attn-JGNN uses tree decomposition to encode the CNF formula into a join-graph, then performs iterative message passing on the join-graph, and finally approximates the model number by learning partition functions. In order to further improve the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model achieves better results than other neural network methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[An intelligent agent-based simulation of human mobility in extreme urban morphologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15143v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the feasibility of human mobility in extreme urban morphologies, characterized by high-density vertical structures and linear city layouts. To assess whether agents can navigate efficiently within such unprecedented topologies, we develop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling, reinforcement learning (RL), supervised learning, and graph neural networks (GNNs). The simulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across multiple vertical levels and varying density scenarios, using both synthetic data and real-world traces from high-density cities. Experiments show that the full AI-integrated architecture enables agents to achieve an average commute time of 7.8--8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89\%, and a reachability index over 91\%, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies indicate that removing intelligent modules such as RL or GNN significantly degrades performance, with commute times increasing by up to 85\% and reachability falling below 70\%. Environmental modeling demonstrates low energy consumption and minimal CO$_2$ emissions when electric modes are prioritized. These results suggest that efficient and sustainable mobility in extreme urban forms is achievable, provided adaptive AI systems, intelligent infrastructure, and real-time feedback mechanisms are implemented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Surrogates to leverage Mechanistic Expert Knowledge towards Reliable and Immediate Pandemic Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06500v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During the COVID-19 crisis, mechanistic models have guided evidence-based decision making. However, time-critical decisions in a dynamical environment limit the time available to gather supporting evidence. We address this bottleneck by developing a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate of an age-structured and spatially resolved mechanistic metapopulation simulation model. This combined approach complements classical modeling approaches which are mostly mechanistic and purely data-driven machine learning approaches which are often black box. Our design of experiments spans outbreak and persistent-threat regimes, up to three contact change points, and age-structured contact matrices on a spatial graph with 400 nodes representing German counties. We benchmark multiple GNN layers and identify an ARMAConv-based architecture that offers a strong accuracy-runtime trade-off. Across horizons of 30-90 day simulation and prediction, allowing up to three contact change points, the surrogate model attains 10-27 \% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) while delivering (near) constant runtime with respect to the forecast horizon. Our approach accelerates evaluation by up to 28,670 times compared with the mechanistic model, allowing responsive decision support in time-critical scenarios and straightforward web integration. These results show how GNN surrogates can translate complex metapopulation models into immediate, reliable tools for pandemic response.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[SGAC: A Graph Neural Network Framework for Imbalanced and Structure-Aware AMP Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16276v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifying Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) from the vast collection of peptides derived from metagenomic sequencing offers a promising avenue for combating antibiotic resistance. However, most existing AMP classification methods rely primarily on sequence-based representations and fail to capture the spatial structural information critical for accurate identification. Although recent graph-based approaches attempt to incorporate structural information, they typically construct residue- or atom-level graphs that introduce redundant atomic details and increase structural complexity. Furthermore, the class imbalance between the small number of known AMPs and the abundant non-AMPs significantly hinders predictive performance. To address these challenges, we employ lightweight OmegaFold to predict the three-dimensional structures of peptides and construct peptide graphs using C α atoms to capture their backbone geometry and spatial topology. Building on this representation, we propose the Spatial GNN-based AMP Classifier (SGAC), a novel framework that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract structural features and generate discriminative graph representations. To handle class imbalance, SGAC incorporates Weight-enhanced Contrastive Learning to cluster structurally similar peptides and separate dissimilar ones through adaptive weighting, and applies Weight-enhanced Pseudo-label Distillation to generate high-confidence pseudo labels for unlabeled samples, achieving balanced and consistent representation learning. Experiments on publicly available AMP and non-AMP datasets demonstrate that SGAC significantly achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |

Current methods utilize deep learning methods for face recognition. However, these methods lack effective mechanisms to model cross-domain structural correspondence between two different forensic modalities. In this paper, we introduce a SPOT-Face, a superpixel graph-based framework designed for cross-domain forensic face identification of victims using their skeleton and sketch images. Our unified framework involves constructing a superpixel-based graph from an image and then using different graph neural networks(GNNs) backbones to extract the embeddings of these graphs, while cross-domain correspondence is established through attention-guided optimal transport mechanism. We have evaluated our proposed framework on two publicly available dataset: IIT\_Mandi\_S2F (S2F) and CUFS. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate our proposed framework. The experimental results show significant improvement in identification metrics ( i.e., Recall, mAP) over existing graph-based baselines. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates to be highly effective for matching skulls and sketches to faces in forensic investigations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables (ICPR_2026)</p></details> |

To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce GPA(graph neural network (GNN)-based Path-Aware multi-view circuit learning), a novel GNN framework that learns precise, data-driven delay predictions by synergistically fusing three complementary views of circuit structure: And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs)-based functional encoding, post-mapping technology emphasizes critical timing paths. Trained exclusively on real cell delays extracted from critical paths of industrial-grade post-mapping netlists, GPA learns to classify cut delays with unprecedented accuracy, directly informing smarter mapping decisions. Evaluated on the 19 EPFL combinational benchmarks, GPA achieves 19.9%, 2.1% and 4.1% average delay reduction over the conventional heuristics methods (techmap, MCH) and the prior state-of-the-art ML-based approach SLAP, respectively-without compromising area efficiency.</p></details> | 7pages, 4figures |
