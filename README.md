| **[Graph-Aware Diffusion for Signal Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05036v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of generating graph signals from unknown distributions defined over given graphs, relevant to domains such as recommender systems or sensor networks. Our approach builds on generative diffusion models, which are well established in vision and graph generation but remain underexplored for graph signals. Existing methods lack generality, either ignoring the graph structure in the forward process or designing graph-aware mechanisms tailored to specific domains. We adopt a forward process that incorporates the graph through the heat equation. Rather than relying on the standard formulation, we consider a time-warped coefficient to mitigate the exponential decay of the drift term, yielding a graph-aware generative diffusion model (GAD). We analyze its forward dynamics, proving convergence to a Gaussian Markov random field with covariance parametrized by the graph Laplacian, and interpret the backward dynamics as a sequence of graph-signal denoising problems. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of GAD on synthetic data, real traffic speed measurements, and a temperature sensor network.</p></details> |  |

We propose an LLM-based music recommendation system with tool calling to serve as a unified retrieval-reranking pipeline. Our system positions an LLM as an end-to-end recommendation system that interprets user intent, plans tool invocations, and orchestrates specialized components: boolean filters (SQL), sparse retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (embedding similarity), and generative retrieval (semantic IDs). Through tool planning, the system predicts which types of tools to use, their execution order, and the arguments needed to find music matching user preferences, supporting diverse modalities while seamlessly integrating multiple database filtering methods. We demonstrate that this unified tool-calling framework achieves competitive performance across diverse recommendation scenarios by selectively employing appropriate retrieval methods based on user queries, envisioning a new paradigm for conversational music recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at The Workshop on AI for Music, Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS-AI4Music)</p></details> |
| **[Compressed Concatenation of Small Embedding Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04626v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedding models are central to dense retrieval, semantic search, and recommendation systems, but their size often makes them impractical to deploy in resource-constrained environments such as browsers or edge devices. While smaller embedding models offer practical advantages, they typically underperform compared to their larger counterparts. To bridge this gap, we demonstrate that concatenating the raw embedding vectors of multiple small models can outperform a single larger baseline on standard retrieval benchmarks. To overcome the resulting high dimensionality of naive concatenation, we introduce a lightweight unified decoder trained with a Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) loss. This decoder maps the high-dimensional joint representation to a low-dimensional space, preserving most of the original performance without fine-tuning the base models. We also show that while concatenating more base models yields diminishing gains, the robustness of the decoder's representation under compression and quantization improves. Our experiments show that, on a subset of MTEB retrieval tasks, our concat-encode-quantize pipeline recovers 89\% of the original performance with a 48x compression factor when the pipeline is applied to a concatenation of four small embedding models.</p></details> |  |
| **[TranSUN: A Preemptive Paradigm to Eradicate Retransformation Bias Intrinsically from Regression Models in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13881v5)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regression models are crucial in recommender systems. However, retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model, facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems. Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically from the models via minor model refinement. Specifically, a novel TranSUN method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods across data from various domains, which have been successfully deployed in two real-world industrial recommendation scenarios, i.e. product and short video recommendation scenarios in Guess What You Like business domain in the homepage of Taobao App (a leading e-commerce platform with DAU > 300M), to serve the major online traffic.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 6 figures, NeurIPS 2025 Poster</p></details> |
| **[MARCO: A Cooperative Knowledge Transfer Framework for Personalized Cross-domain Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04508v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems frequently encounter data sparsity issues, particularly when addressing cold-start scenarios involving new users or items. Multi-source cross-domain recommendation (CDR) addresses these challenges by transferring valuable knowledge from multiple source domains to enhance recommendations in a target domain. However, existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based CDR methods typically rely on a single-agent framework, leading to negative transfer issues caused by inconsistent domain contributions and inherent distributional discrepancies among source domains. To overcome these limitations, MARCO, a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based Cross-Domain recommendation framework, is proposed. It leverages cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, where each agent is dedicated to estimating the contribution from an individual source domain, effectively managing credit assignment and mitigating negative transfer. In addition, an entropy-based action diversity penalty is introduced to enhance policy expressiveness and stabilize training by encouraging diverse agents' joint actions. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate MARCO's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its robustness and strong generalization capabilities.

| **[Causality-aware Graph Aggregation Weight Estimator for Popularity Debiasing in Top-K Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04502v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based recommender systems leverage neighborhood aggregation to generate node representations, which is highly sensitive to popularity bias, resulting in an echo effect during information propagation. Existing graph-based debiasing solutions refine the aggregation process with attempts such as edge reconstruction or weight adjustment. However, these methods remain inadequate in fully alleviating popularity bias. Specifically, this is because 1) they provide no insights into graph aggregation rationality, thus lacking an optimality guarantee; 2) they fail to well balance the training and debiasing process, which undermines the effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mitigate popularity bias through rational modeling of the graph aggregation process. We reveal that graph aggregation is a special form of backdoor adjustment in causal inference, where the aggregation weight corresponds to the historical interaction likelihood distribution. Based on this insight, we devise an encoder-decoder architecture, namely Causality-aware Graph Aggregation Weight Estimator for Debiasing (CAGED), to approximate the unbiased aggregation weight by optimizing the evidence lower bound of the interaction likelihood. In order to enhance the debiasing effectiveness during early training stages, we further design a momentum update strategy that incrementally refines the aggregation weight matrix. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that CAGED outperforms existing graph-based debiasing methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/QueYork/CAGED.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Applications of State Space Models and Advanced Training Techniques in Sequential Recommendations: A Comparative Study on Efficiency and Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05606v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems aim to estimate the dynamically changing user preferences and sequential dependencies between historical user behaviour and metadata. Although transformer-based models have proven to be effective in sequential recommendations, their state growth is proportional to the length of the sequence that is being processed, which makes them expensive in terms of memory and inference costs. Our research focused on three promising directions in sequential recommendations: enhancing speed through the use of State Space Models (SSM), as they can achieve SOTA results in the sequential recommendations domain with lower latency, memory, and inference costs, as proposed by arXiv:2403.03900 improving the quality of recommendations with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Monolithic Preference Optimization without Reference Model (ORPO); and implementing adaptive batch- and step-size algorithms to reduce costs and accelerate training processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.07691 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Empowering Denoising Sequential Recommendation with Large Language Model Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04239v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation aims to capture user preferences by modeling sequential patterns in user-item interactions. However, these models are often influenced by noise such as accidental interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. Therefore, to reduce the effect of noise, some works propose explicitly identifying and removing noisy items. However, we find that simply relying on collaborative information may result in an over-denoising problem, especially for cold items. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework: Interest Alignment for Denoising Sequential Recommendation (IADSR) which integrates both collaborative and semantic information. Specifically, IADSR is comprised of two stages: in the first stage, we obtain the collaborative and semantic embeddings of each item from a traditional sequential recommendation model and an LLM, respectively. In the second stage, we align the collaborative and semantic embeddings and then identify noise in the interaction sequence based on long-term and short-term interests captured in the collaborative and semantic modalities. Our extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and its compatibility with different sequential recommendation systems.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM2025 |
| **[Prompt Tuning as User Inherent Profile Inference Machine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06577v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant promise in recommender systems by empowering user profiles with their extensive world knowledge and superior reasoning capabilities. However, LLMs face challenges like unstable instruction compliance, modality gaps, and high inference latency, leading to textual noise and limiting their effectiveness in recommender systems. To address these challenges, we propose UserIP-Tuning, which uses prompt-tuning to infer user profiles. It integrates the causal relationship between user profiles and behavior sequences into LLMs' prompts. It employs Expectation Maximization (EM) to infer the embedded latent profile, minimizing textual noise by fixing the prompt template. Furthermore, a profile quantization codebook bridges the modality gap by categorizing profile embeddings into collaborative IDs pre-stored for online deployment. This improves time efficiency and reduces memory usage. Experiments show that UserIP-Tuning outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. An industry application confirms its effectiveness, robustness, and transferability. The presented solution has been deployed in Huawei AppGallery's Explore page since May 2025, serving 2 million daily active users, delivering significant improvements in real-world recommendation scenarios. The code is publicly available for replication at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/UserIP-Tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural Reward Model: Enhancing Interpretability, Efficiency, and Scalability in Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25361v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios, allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[C2AL: Cohort-Contrastive Auxiliary Learning for Large-scale Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02215v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns, neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models. Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16% reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on targeted minority cohorts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[MTRec: Learning to Align with User Preferences via Mental Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22807v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation models are predominantly trained using implicit user feedback, since explicit feedback is often costly to obtain. However, implicit feedback, such as clicks, does not always reflect users' real preferences. For example, a user might click on a news article because of its attractive headline, but end up feeling uncomfortable after reading the content. In the absence of explicit feedback, such erroneous implicit signals may severely mislead recommender systems. In this paper, we propose MTRec, a novel sequential recommendation framework designed to align with real user preferences by uncovering their internal satisfaction on recommended items. Specifically, we introduce a mental reward model to quantify user satisfaction and propose a distributional inverse reinforcement learning approach to learn it. The learned mental reward model is then used to guide recommendation models to better align with users' real preferences. Our experiments show that MTRec brings significant improvements to a variety of recommendation models. We also deploy MTRec on an industrial short video platform and observe a 7 percent increase in average user viewing time.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Review on Harnessing Large Language Models to Overcome Recommender System Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21117v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have traditionally followed modular architectures comprising candidate generation, multi-stage ranking, and re-ranking, each trained separately with supervised objectives and hand-engineered features. While effective in many domains, such systems face persistent challenges including sparse and noisy interaction data, cold-start problems, limited personalization depth, and inadequate semantic understanding of user and item content. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new paradigm for addressing these limitations through unified, language-native mechanisms that can generalize across tasks, domains, and modalities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive technical survey of how LLMs can be leveraged to tackle key challenges in modern recommender systems. We examine the use of LLMs for prompt-driven candidate retrieval, language-native ranking, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendation, illustrating how these approaches enhance personalization, semantic alignment, and interpretability without requiring extensive task-specific supervision. LLMs further enable zero- and few-shot reasoning, allowing systems to operate effectively in cold-start and long-tail scenarios by leveraging external knowledge and contextual cues. We categorize these emerging LLM-driven architectures and analyze their effectiveness in mitigating core bottlenecks of conventional pipelines. In doing so, we provide a structured framework for understanding the design space of LLM-enhanced recommenders, and outline the trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance. Our goal is to demonstrate that LLMs are not merely auxiliary components but foundational enablers for building more adaptive, semantically rich, and user-centric recommender systems</p></details> |  |
| **[AgenticRAG: Tool-Augmented Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Explainable Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02668v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet their application in recommender systems remains limited by reasoning opacity and knowledge constraints. This paper introduces AgenticRAG, a novel framework that combines tool-augmented foundation models with retrieval-augmented generation for zero-shot explainable recommendations. Our approach integrates external tool invocation, knowledge retrieval, and chain-of-thought reasoning to create autonomous recommendation agents capable of transparent decision-making without task-specific training. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AgenticRAG achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with NDCG@10 improvements of 0.4\% on Amazon Electronics, 0.8\% on MovieLens-1M, and 1.6\% on Yelp datasets. The framework exhibits superior explainability while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to traditional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple but Effective Elaborative Query Reformulation Approach for Natural Language Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02656v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural Language (NL) recommender systems aim to retrieve relevant items from free-form user queries and item descriptions. Existing systems often rely on dense retrieval (DR), which struggles to interpret challenging queries that express broad (e.g., "cities for youth friendly activities") or indirect (e.g., "cities for a high school graduation trip") user intents. While query reformulation (QR) has been widely adopted to improve such systems, existing QR methods tend to focus only on expanding the range of query subtopics (breadth) or elaborating on the potential meaning of a query (depth), but not both. In this paper, we propose EQR (Elaborative Subtopic Query Reformulation), a large language model-based QR method that combines both breadth and depth by generating potential query subtopics with information-rich elaborations. We also introduce three new natural language recommendation benchmarks in travel, hotel, and restaurant domains to establish evaluation of NL recommendation with challenging queries. Experiments show EQR substantially outperforms state-of-the-art QR methods in various evaluation metrics, highlighting that a simple yet effective QR approach can significantly improve NL recommender systems for queries with broad and indirect user intents.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Understanding Generative Recommendation with Semantic IDs from a Model-scaling View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25522v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs), which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders (e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks. Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information, showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from 44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Co-NAML-LSTUR: A Combined Model with Attentive Multi-View Learning and Long- and Short-term User Representations for News Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20210v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>News recommendation systems play a critical role in alleviating information overload by delivering personalized content. A key challenge lies in jointly modeling multi-view representations of news articles and capturing the dynamic, dual-scale nature of user interests-encompassing both short- and long-term preferences. Prior methods often rely on single-view features or insufficiently model user behavior across time. In this work, we introduce Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news encoding and LSTUR for hierarchical user modeling, designed for training on limited data resources. Our approach leverages BERT-based embeddings to enhance semantic representation. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Results show that our model significantly outperforms strong baselines, achieving improvements over NRMS by 1.55% in AUC and 1.15% in MRR, and over NAML by 2.45% in AUC and 1.71% in MRR. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our efficiency-focused hybrid model, which combines multi-view news modeling with dual-scale user representations for practical, resource-limited resources rather than a claim to absolute state-of-the-art (SOTA). The implementation of our model is publicly available at https://github.com/MinhNguyenDS/Co-NAML-LSTUR</p></details> | MIWAI 2025 |
| **[Break the ID-Language Barrier: An Adaption Framework for LLM-based Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18262v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent breakthrough of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing has sparked exploration in recommendation systems, however, their limited domain-specific knowledge remains a critical bottleneck. Specifically, LLMs lack key pieces of information crucial for sequential recommendations, such as user behavior patterns. To address this critical gap, we propose IDLE-Adapter, a novel framework that integrates pre-trained ID embeddings, rich in domain-specific knowledge, into LLMs to improve recommendation accuracy. IDLE-Adapter acts as a bridge, transforming sparse user-item interaction data into dense, LLM-compatible representations through a Pre-trained ID Sequential Model, Dimensionality Alignment, Layer-wise Embedding Refinement, and Layer-wise Distribution Alignment. Furthermore, IDLE-Adapter demonstrates remarkable flexibility by seamlessly integrating ID embeddings from diverse ID-based sequential models and LLM architectures. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the superiority of IDLE-Adapter, achieving over 10\% and 20\% improvements in HitRate@5 and NDCG@5 metrics, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shilling Recommender Systems by Generating Side-feature-aware Fake User Profiles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17918v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RS) greatly influence users' consumption decisions, making them attractive targets for malicious shilling attacks that inject fake user profiles to manipulate recommendations. Existing shilling methods can generate effective and stealthy fake profiles when training data only contain rating matrix, but they lack comprehensive solutions for scenarios where side features are present and utilized by the recommender. To address this gap, we extend the Leg-UP framework by enhancing the generator architecture to incorporate side features, enabling the generation of side-feature-aware fake user profiles. Experiments on benchmarks show that our method achieves strong attack performance while maintaining stealthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ranking Items from Discrete Ratings: The Cost of Unknown User Thresholds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01871v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ranking items is a central task in many information retrieval and recommender systems. User input for the ranking task often comes in the form of ratings on a coarse discrete scale. We ask whether it is possible to recover a fine-grained item ranking from such coarse-grained ratings. We model items as having scores and users as having thresholds; a user rates an item positively if the item's score exceeds the user's threshold. Although all users agree on the total item order, estimating that order is challenging when both the scores and the thresholds are latent. Under our model, any ranking method naturally partitions the $n$ items into bins; the bins are ordered, but the items inside each bin are still unordered. Users arrive sequentially, and every new user can be queried to refine the current ranking. We prove that achieving a near-perfect ranking, measured by Spearman distance, requires $\Theta(n^2)$ users (and therefore $\Omega(n^2)$ queries). This is significantly worse than the $O(n\log n)$ queries needed to rank from comparisons; the gap reflects the additional queries needed to identify the users who have the appropriate thresholds. Our bound also quantifies the impact of a mismatch between score and threshold distributions via a quadratic divergence factor. To show the tightness of our results, we provide a ranking algorithm whose query complexity matches our bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our work reveals a tension in online ranking: diversity in thresholds is necessary to merge coarse ratings from many users into a fine-grained ranking, but this diversity has a cost if the thresholds are a priori unknown.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Reasoning over User Preferences: Knowledge Graph-Augmented LLMs for Explainable Conversational Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14459v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations by capturing user preferences through interactive dialogues. Explainability in CRSs is crucial as it enables users to understand the reasoning behind recommendations, increasing system transparency and trustworthiness. However, current CRSs often leverage knowledge graphs (KGs) or language models to extract and represent user preferences as latent vectors, which limits their explainability. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities that can bridge this gap by generating human-understandable preference summaries. However, effectively reasoning over user preferences in CRSs remains challenging as LLMs pre-trained on large-scale corpora may not be well-suited for analyzing user preferences. While KGs provide rich domain knowledge, integrating them with LLMs encounters a significant modality gap between structured KG information and unstructured conversations. In this paper, we propose COMPASS, a plug-and-play framework that synergizes LLMs and KGs to reason over user preferences, enhancing the performance and explainability of existing CRSs. COMPASS employs a two-stage training approach: first, it bridges the gap between the structured KG and natural language through novel graph entity captioning pre-training. Next, COMPASS optimizes user preference reasoning via knowledge-aware instruction fine-tuning, where the LLM learns to reason and summarize user preferences from dialogue histories and KG-augmented context. This enables COMPASS to perform knowledge-aware reasoning and generate interpretable user preferences that can seamlessly integrate with existing CRS models for improving recommendation performance and explainability. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of COMPASS in improving various CRS models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |

However, capturing the heterophily patterns and the multi-dimensional nature of user-item interactions poses significant challenges. To address this, we introduce FWHDNN (Fusion-based Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Networks), an innovative framework aimed at advancing representation learning in hypergraph-based recommendation tasks. The model incorporates three key components: (1) a cross-difference relation encoder leveraging heterophily-aware hypergraph diffusion to adapt message-passing for diverse class labels, (2) a multi-level cluster-wise encoder employing wavelet transform-based hypergraph neural network layers to capture multi-scale topological relationships, and (3) an integrated multi-modal fusion mechanism that combines structural and textual information through intermediate and late-fusion strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FWHDNN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and scalability in capturing high-order interconnections between users and items.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed and extended results</p></details> |

This paper introduces an enhanced generative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through five key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented generation mechanisms, causal inference-based debiasing, explainable recommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent improvements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to existing approaches.

| **[AgentRec: Next-Generation LLM-Powered Multi-Agent Collaborative Recommendation with Adaptive Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01609v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with 2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent coordination.</p></details> |  |

Target-free User Simulation for Evaluating Conversational Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16160v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have tried to simulate real-world users engaging in conversations with CRSs to create more realistic testing environments that reflect the complexity of human-agent dialogue. Despite the significant advancements, reliably evaluating the capability of CRSs to elicit user preferences still faces a significant challenge. Existing evaluation metrics often rely on target-biased user simulators that assume users have predefined preferences, leading to interactions that devolve into simplistic guessing game. These simulators typically guide the CRS toward specific target items based on fixed attributes, limiting the dynamic exploration of user preferences and struggling to capture the evolving nature of real-user interactions. Additionally, current evaluation metrics are predominantly focused on single-turn recall of target items, neglecting the intermediate processes of preference elicitation. To address this, we introduce PEPPER, a novel CRS evaluation protocol with target-free user simulators constructed from real-user interaction histories and reviews. PEPPER enables realistic user-CRS dialogues without falling into simplistic guessing games, allowing users to gradually discover their preferences through enriched interactions, thereby providing a more accurate and reliable assessment of the CRS's ability to elicit personal preferences. Furthermore, PEPPER presents detailed measures for comprehensively evaluating the preference elicitation capabilities of CRSs, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative measures that capture four distinct aspects of the preference elicitation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the validity of PEPPER as a simulation environment and conduct a thorough analysis of how effectively existing CRSs perform in preference elicitation and recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations themselves. To evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary insights beyond the quantitative results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear Bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00602v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters). Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves regret $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$ with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and $|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Panorama: Fast-Track Nearest Neighbors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00566v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space, aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns. Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Face2Feel: Emotion-Aware Adaptive User Interface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00489v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Face2Feel, a novel user interface (UI) model that dynamically adapts to user emotions and preferences captured through computer vision. This adaptive UI framework addresses the limitations of traditional static interfaces by integrating digital image processing, face recognition, and emotion detection techniques. Face2Feel analyzes user expressions utilizing a webcam or pre-installed camera as the primary data source to personalize the UI in real-time. Although dynamically changing user interfaces based on emotional states are not yet widely implemented, their advantages and the demand for such systems are evident. This research contributes to the development of emotion-aware applications, particularly in recommendation systems and feedback mechanisms. A case study, "Shresta: Emotion-Based Book Recommendation System," demonstrates the practical implementation of this framework, the technologies employed, and the system's usefulness. Furthermore, a user survey conducted after presenting the working model reveals a strong demand for such adaptive interfaces, emphasizing the importance of user satisfaction and comfort in human-computer interaction. The results showed that nearly 85.7\% of the users found these systems to be very engaging and user-friendly. This study underscores the potential for emotion-driven UI adaptation to improve user experiences across various applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Reinforced Strategy Optimization for Conversational Recommender Systems via Network-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26093v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations through multi-turn natural language interactions with users. Given the strong interaction and reasoning skills of Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging LLMs for CRSs has recently emerged as a promising direction. However, existing LLM-based methods often lack explicit optimization of interaction strategies, instead relying on unified prompts and the LLM's internal knowledge to decide how to interact, which can lead to suboptimal outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO) method for CRS, which decomposes the process of generating strategy-driven response decisions into the macro-level strategy planning and micro-level strategy adaptation through a network-of-experts architecture. At the macro level, a Planner expert selects macro-level interaction strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage). At the micro level, an Actor expert generates detailed responses conditioned on the selected macro-level strategy, guided by auxiliary experts that provide complementary information such as user preferences and factual grounding. This hierarchical decomposition disentangles the optimization of different sub-tasks involved in CRS response generation, enabling more tractable learning at each level. To address the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn training data, we formulate strategy learning as a reinforcement learning problem, guided by an LLM-based reward model to achieve automatic strategy exploration. Extensive experiments show that RSO significantly improves interaction performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit hierarchical strategy optimization for CRS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive Recommendation Agent with Active User Commands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21317v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes.</p></details> | Under Review |

Analyzing Content Creator Earnings Across Large Social Media Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26523v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines whether monthly content creator earnings follow a power law distribution, driven by compounding 'rich-get-richer' dynamics (Barabasi and Albert 1999). Patreon creator earnings data for 2018, 2021, and 2024 for Instagram, Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Patreon exhibit a power law exponent around $\alpha = 2$. This suggests that algorithmic systems generate unequalizing returns closer to highly concentrated capital income and wealth, rather than labor income. Platforms governed by powerful and compounding recommendation systems, such as Instagram and YouTube, exhibit both a stronger power law relation (lower $\alpha$) and lower mean, median, and interquartile earnings, indicating algorithms that disproportionately favor top earners at the expense of a 'middle class' of creators. In contrast, Twitter and Patreon have a more moderate $\alpha$, with less earnings inequality and higher middle class earnings. Policies which incentivize the algorithmic promotion of longer-tail content (to explore more and exploit less) may help creator ecosystems become more equitable and sustainable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Informed Dataset Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26448v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The selection of datasets in recommender systems research lacks a systematic methodology. Researchers often select datasets based on popularity rather than empirical suitability. We developed the APS Explorer, a web application that implements the Algorithm Performance Space (APS) framework for informed dataset selection. The system analyzes 96 datasets using 28 algorithms across three metrics (nDCG, Hit Ratio, Recall) at five K-values. We extend the APS framework with a statistical based classification system that categorizes datasets into five difficulty levels based on quintiles. We also introduce a variance-normalized distance metric based on Mahalanobis distance to measure similarity. The APS Explorer was successfully developed with three interactive modules for visualizing algorithm performance, direct comparing algorithms, and analyzing dataset metadata. This tool shifts the process of selecting datasets from intuition-based to evidence-based practices, and it is publicly available at datasets.recommender-systems.com.</p></details> | 45 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Solving the Cold Start Problem on One's Own as an End User via Preference Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12398v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new approach that enables end users to directly solve the cold start problem by themselves. The cold start problem is a common issue in recommender systems, and many methods have been proposed to address the problem on the service provider's side. However, when the service provider does not take action, users are left with poor recommendations and no means to improve their experience. We propose an algorithm, Pretender, that allows end users to proactively solve the cold start problem on their own. Pretender does not require any special support from the service provider and can be deployed independently by users. We formulate the problem as minimizing the distance between the source and target distributions and optimize item selection from the target service accordingly. Furthermore, we establish theoretical guarantees for Pretender based on a discrete quadrature problem. We conduct experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of Pretender.</p></details> | TMLR 2025 |
| **[Items Proxy Bridging: Enabling Frictionless Critiquing in Knowledge Graph Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26107v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern recommender systems place great inclination towards facilitating user experience, as more applications enabling users to critique and then refine recommendations immediately. Considering the real-time requirements, critique-able recommender systems typically straight modify the model parameters and update the recommend list through analyzing the user critiquing keyphrases in the inference phase. Current critiquing methods require first constructing a specially designated model which establish direct correlations between users and keyphrases during the training phase allowing for innovative recommendations upon the critiquing,restricting the applicable scenarios. Additionally, all these approaches ignore the catastrophic forgetting problem, where the cumulative changes in parameters during continuous multi-step critiquing may lead to a collapse in model performance. Thus, We conceptualize a proxy bridging users and keyphrases, proposing a streamlined yet potent Items Proxy Generic Critiquing Framework (IPGC) framework, which can serve as a universal plugin for most knowledge graph recommender models based on collaborative filtering (CF) strategies. IPGC provides a new paradigm for frictionless integration of critique mechanisms to enable iterative recommendation refinement in mainstream recommendation scenarios. IPGC describes the items proxy mechanism for transforming the critiquing optimization objective of user-keyphrase pairs into user-item pairs, adapting it for general CF recommender models without the necessity of specifically designed user-keyphrase correlation module. Furthermore, an anti-forgetting regularizer is introduced in order to efficiently mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem of the model as a prior for critiquing optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fading to Grow: Growing Preference Ratios via Preference Fading Discrete Diffusion for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26063v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommenders aim to rank items from a discrete item corpus in line with user interests, yet suffer from extremely sparse user preference data. Recent advances in diffusion models have inspired diffusion-based recommenders, which alleviate sparsity by injecting noise during a forward process to prevent the collapse of perturbed preference distributions. However, current diffusion-based recommenders predominantly rely on continuous Gaussian noise, which is intrinsically mismatched with the discrete nature of user preference data in recommendation. In this paper, building upon recent advances in discrete diffusion, we propose PreferGrow, a discrete diffusion-based recommender system that models preference ratios by fading and growing user preferences over the discrete item corpus. PreferGrow differs from existing diffusion-based recommenders in three core aspects: (1) Discrete modeling of preference ratios: PreferGrow models relative preference ratios between item pairs, rather than operating in the item representation or raw score simplex. This formulation aligns naturally with the discrete and ranking-oriented nature of recommendation tasks. (2) Perturbing via preference fading: Instead of injecting continuous noise, PreferGrow fades user preferences by replacing the preferred item with alternatives -- physically akin to negative sampling -- thereby eliminating the need for any prior noise assumption. (3) Preference reconstruction via growing: PreferGrow reconstructs user preferences by iteratively growing the preference signals from the estimated ratios. PreferGrow offers a well-defined matrix-based formulation with theoretical guarantees on Markovianity and reversibility, and it demonstrates consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art diffusion-based recommenders across five benchmark datasets, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and empirical effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Empowered by neural networks' optimization capability and the bounding effect of Rayleigh quotient, we propose a Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) for k-NN preserving dimensionality reduction. RAE constrains the network parameter variation through regularization terms, adjusting singular values to control embedding magnitude changes during reduction, thus preserving k-NN relationships. We provide a rigorous mathematical analysis demonstrating that regularization establishes an upper bound on the norm distortion rate of transformed vectors, thereby offering provable guarantees for k-NN preservation. With modest training overhead, RAE achieves superior k-NN recall compared to existing DR approaches while maintaining fast retrieval efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Most existing defenses emphasize user-side behaviors while overlooking item-side features such as titles and descriptions that can expose malicious intent. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore, we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods shows its strong generalization capability.

| **[Denoising Neural Reranker for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18736v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For multi-stage recommenders in industry, a user request would first trigger a simple and efficient retriever module that selects and ranks a list of relevant items, then the recommender calls a slower but more sophisticated reranking model that refines the item list exposure to the user. To consistently optimize the two-stage retrieval reranking framework, most efforts have focused on learning reranker-aware retrievers. In contrast, there has been limited work on how to achieve a retriever-aware reranker. In this work, we provide evidence that the retriever scores from the previous stage are informative signals that have been underexplored. Specifically, we first empirically show that the reranking task under the two-stage framework is naturally a noise reduction problem on the retriever scores, and theoretically show the limitations of naive utilization techniques of the retriever scores. Following this notion, we derive an adversarial framework DNR that associates the denoising reranker with a carefully designed noise generation module. The resulting DNR solution extends the conventional score error minimization loss with three augmented objectives, including: 1) a denoising objective that aims to denoise the noisy retriever scores to align with the user feedback; 2) an adversarial retriever score generation objective that improves the exploration in the retriever score space; and 3) a distribution regularization term that aims to align the distribution of generated noisy retriever scores with the real ones. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets and an industrial recommender system, together with analytical support, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed DNR.</p></details> |  |

Given streaming access to an unknown quantum state, in each round we select an observable from a set of actions to maximize its expectation value. Using past information, we refine actions to minimize regret; the cumulative gap between current reward and the maximum possible. We derive information-theoretic lower bounds and optimal strategies with matching upper bounds, showing regret typically scales as the square root of rounds. As an application, we reframe quantum state tomography to both learn the state efficiently and minimize measurement disturbance. For pure states and continuous actions, we achieve polylogarithmic regret using a sample-optimal algorithm based on a weighted online least squares estimator. The algorithm relies on the optimistic principle and controls the eigenvalues of the design matrix. We also apply our framework to quantum recommender systems and thermodynamic work extraction from unknown states. In this last setting, our results demonstrate an exponential advantage in work dissipation over tomography-based protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis, Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore</p></details> |

Prevailing masked attention models, relying on a single query from the most recent item, are sensitive to this noise, reducing prediction reliability. We propose the Multi-Item-Query attention mechanism (MIQ-Attn) to enhance model stability and accuracy. MIQ-Attn constructs multiple diverse query vectors from user interactions, effectively mitigating noise and improving consistency. It is designed for easy adoption as a drop-in replacement for existing single-query attention. Experiments show MIQ-Attn significantly improves performance on benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Past To Path: Masked History Learning for Next-Item Prediction in Generative Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23649v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation, which directly generates item identifiers, has emerged as a promising paradigm for recommendation systems. However, its potential is fundamentally constrained by the reliance on purely autoregressive training. This approach focuses solely on predicting the next item while ignoring the rich internal structure of a user's interaction history, thus failing to grasp the underlying intent. To address this limitation, we propose Masked History Learning (MHL), a novel training framework that shifts the objective from simple next-step prediction to deep comprehension of history. MHL augments the standard autoregressive objective with an auxiliary task of reconstructing masked historical items, compelling the model to understand ``why'' an item path is formed from the user's past behaviors, rather than just ``what'' item comes next. We introduce two key contributions to enhance this framework: (1) an entropy-guided masking policy that intelligently targets the most informative historical items for reconstruction, and (2) a curriculum learning scheduler that progressively transitions from history reconstruction to future prediction. Experiments on three public datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, highlighting that a comprehensive understanding of the past is crucial for accurately predicting a user's future path. The code will be released to the public.</p></details> |  |
| **[R1-Ranker: Teaching LLM Rankers to Reason](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21638v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning abilities in domains like mathematics, coding, and scientific problem-solving, yet their potential for ranking tasks, where prime examples include retrieval, recommender systems, and LLM routing, remains underexplored. Ranking requires complex reasoning across heterogeneous candidates, but existing LLM-based rankers are often domain-specific, tied to fixed backbones, and lack iterative refinement, limiting their ability to fully exploit LLMs' reasoning potential. To address these challenges, we propose R1-Ranker, a reasoning-incentive framework built on reinforcement learning, with two complementary designs: DRanker, which generates full rankings in one shot, and IRanker, which decomposes ranking into an iterative elimination process with step-wise rewards to encourage deeper reasoning. We evaluate unified R1-Rankers on nine datasets spanning recommendation, routing, and passage ranking, showing that IRanker-3B consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses larger 7B models on some tasks, and yields a 15.7% average relative improvement. Ablation and generalization experiments further confirm the critical role of reinforcement learning and iterative reasoning, with IRanker-3B improving zero-shot performance by over 9% on out-of-domain tasks and reasoning traces boosting other LLMs by up to 22.87%. These results demonstrate that unifying diverse ranking tasks with a single reasoning-driven foundation model is both effective and essential for advancing LLM reasoning in ranking scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The multilinear PageRank problem, arising naturally in the study of higher-order Markov chains, is a powerful framework for capturing such interactions, with applications in web ranking, recommendation systems, and social network analysis. It extends the classical Google PageRank model to a tensor-based formulation, leading to a nonlinear system that captures multi-way dependencies between states. Newton-based methods can achieve local quadratic convergence for this problem, but they require solving a large linear system at each iteration, which becomes too costly for large-scale applications. To address this challenge, we present an accelerated Newton-GMRES method that leverages Krylov subspace techniques to approximate the Newton step without explicitly forming the large Jacobian matrix. We further employ vector extrapolation methods, including Minimal Polynomial Extrapolation (MPE), Reduced Rank Extrapolation (RRE), and Anderson Acceleration (AA), to improve the convergence rate and enhance numerical stability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms classical Newton-based solvers in terms of efficiency, robustness, and scalability.</p></details> |  |

To provide personalized recommendations tailored to individual interests, the proposed system considers user interaction data, video content features, and contextual information. With the aid of a hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, the system can capture nuanced relationships between users, video attributes, and engagement patterns. Three datasets are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system: Kwai, TikTok, and MovieLens. Compared to baseline models, such as DeepFM, Wide & Deep, LightGBM, and XGBoost, the proposed MMGCN-based model shows superior performance. A notable feature of the proposed model is that it outperforms all baseline methods in capturing diverse user preferences and making accurate, personalized recommendations, resulting in a Kwai F1 score of 0.574, a Tiktok F1 score of 0.506, and a MovieLens F1 score of 0.197. We emphasize the importance of multi-modal integration and user-centric approaches in advancing recommender systems, emphasizing the role they play in enhancing content discovery and audience interaction on live broadcast platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[EUGENE: Explainable Structure-aware Graph Edit Distance Estimation with Generalized Edit Costs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05885v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The need to identify graphs with small structural distances from a query arises in domains such as biology, chemistry, recommender systems, and social network analysis. Among several methods for measuring inter-graph distance, Graph Edit Distance (GED) is preferred for its comprehensibility, though its computation is hindered by NP-hardness. Optimization based heuristic methods often face challenges in providing accurate approximations. State-of-the-art GED approximations predominantly utilize neural methods, which, however: (i) lack an explanatory edit path corresponding to the approximated GED; (ii) require the NP-hard generation of ground-truth GEDs for training; and (iii) necessitate separate training on each dataset. In this paper, we propose EUGENE, an efficient, algebraic, and structure-aware optimization based method that estimates GED and also provides edit paths corresponding to the estimated cost. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that EUGENE achieves state-of-the-art GED estimation with superior scalability across diverse datasets and generalized cost settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Dialogue Generation for Interactive Conversational Elicitation & Recommendation (ICER)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02331v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While language models (LMs) offer great potential for conversational recommender systems (CRSs), the paucity of public CRS data makes fine-tuning LMs for CRSs challenging. In response, LMs as user simulators qua data generators can be used to train LM-based CRSs, but often lack behavioral consistency, generating utterance sequences inconsistent with those of any real user. To address this, we develop a methodology for generating natural dialogues that are consistent with a user's underlying state using behavior simulators together with LM-prompting. We illustrate our approach by generating a large, open-source CRS data set with both preference elicitation and example critiquing. Rater evaluation on some of these dialogues shows them to exhibit considerable consistency, factuality and naturalness.</p></details> |  |

While recent generative sequence models have shown promise in unifying retrieval and ranking by auto-regressively generating ranked items, existing solutions typically address either personalized search or query-free recommendation, often exhibiting performance trade-offs when attempting to unify both. We introduce \textit{SynerGen}, a novel generative recommender model that bridges this critical gap by providing a single generative backbone for both personalized search and recommendation, while simultaneously excelling at retrieval and ranking tasks. Trained on behavioral sequences, our decoder-only Transformer leverages joint optimization with InfoNCE for retrieval and a hybrid pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking, allowing semantic signals from search to improve recommendation and vice versa. We also propose a novel time-aware rotary positional embedding to effectively incorporate time information into the attention mechanism. \textit{SynerGen} achieves significant improvements on widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong generative recommender and joint search and recommendation baselines. This work demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for industrial-scale unified information access.</p></details> | <details><summary>Gener...</summary><p>Generative Recommender, Recommendation System, Information Retrieval</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Static Testbeds: An Interaction-Centric Agent Simulation Platform for Dynamic Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16429v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating and iterating upon recommender systems is crucial, yet traditional A/B testing is resource-intensive, and offline methods struggle with dynamic user-platform interactions. While agent-based simulation is promising, existing platforms often lack a mechanism for user actions to dynamically reshape the environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce RecInter, a novel agent-based simulation platform for recommender systems featuring a robust interaction mechanism. In RecInter platform, simulated user actions (e.g., likes, reviews, purchases) dynamically update item attributes in real-time, and introduced Merchant Agents can reply, fostering a more realistic and evolving ecosystem. High-fidelity simulation is ensured through Multidimensional User Profiling module, Advanced Agent Architecture, and LLM fine-tuned on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enriched interaction data. Our platform achieves significantly improved simulation credibility and successfully replicates emergent phenomena like Brand Loyalty and the Matthew Effect. Experiments demonstrate that this interaction mechanism is pivotal for simulating realistic system evolution, establishing our platform as a credible testbed for recommender systems research.

Human in the loop shortcomings can increase the risk of failures in recommender systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20099v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are among the most commonly deployed systems today. Systems design approaches to AI-powered recommender systems have done well to urge recommender system developers to follow more intentional data collection, curation, and management procedures. So too has the "human-in-the-loop" paradigm been widely adopted, primarily to address the issue of accountability. However, in this paper, we take the position that human oversight in recommender system design also entails novel risks that have yet to be fully described. These risks are "codetermined" by the information context in which such systems are often deployed. Furthermore, new knowledge of the shortcomings of "human-in-the-loop" practices to deliver meaningful oversight of other AI systems suggest that they may also be inadequate for achieving socially responsible recommendations. We review how the limitations of human oversight may increase the chances of a specific kind of failure: a "cascade" or "compound" failure. We then briefly explore how the unique dynamics of three common deployment contexts can make humans in the loop more likely to fail in their oversight duties. We then conclude with two recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rejuvenating Cross-Entropy Loss in Knowledge Distillation for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20989v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper analyzes Cross-Entropy (CE) loss in knowledge distillation (KD) for recommender systems. KD for recommender systems targets at distilling rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our goal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items. We empirically demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether they are highly ranked by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RCE-KD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Graph-Transformer Out-of-Distribution Generalization Abilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20575v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID) benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts. Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without specialized DG algorithms (on four out of six benchmarks). Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets, specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Highlighting its model-agnostic design, the method yielded valuable insights into both GT and MPNN backbones and appears well suited for broader DG applications beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Representation-disentangled Information Bottleneck for Multimodal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20225v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal data has significantly advanced recommendation systems by integrating diverse information sources to model user preferences and item characteristics. However, these systems often struggle with redundant and irrelevant information, which can degrade performance. Most existing methods either fuse multimodal information directly or use rigid architectural separation for disentanglement, failing to adequately filter noise and model the complex interplay between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, the Multimodal Representation-disentangled Information Bottleneck (MRdIB). Concretely, we first employ a Multimodal Information Bottleneck to compress the input representations, effectively filtering out task-irrelevant noise while preserving rich semantic information. Then, we decompose the information based on its relationship with the recommendation target into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. We achieve this decomposition with a series of constraints: a unique information learning objective to preserve modality-unique signals, a redundant information learning objective to minimize overlap, and a synergistic information learning objective to capture emergent information. By optimizing these objectives, MRdIB guides a model to learn more powerful and disentangled representations. Extensive experiments on several competitive models and three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our MRdIB in enhancing multimodal recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intelligent Algorithm Selection for Recommender Systems: Meta-Learning via in-depth algorithm feature engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20134v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The "No Free Lunch" theorem dictates that no single recommender algorithm is optimal for all users, creating a significant Algorithm Selection Problem. Standard meta-learning approaches aim to solve this by selecting an algorithm based on user features, but treat the fundamentally diverse algorithms themselves as equivalent, "black-box" choices. This thesis investigates the impact of overcoming this limitation by engineering a comprehensive feature set to explicitly characterize the algorithms themselves. We combine static code metrics, Abstract Syntax Tree properties, behavioral performance landmarks, and high-level conceptual features. We evaluate two meta-learners across five datasets: a baseline using only user features and our proposed model using both user and algorithm features. Our results show that the meta-learner augmented with algorithm features achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.143, a statistically significant improvement of 11.7% over the Single Best Algorithm baseline (0.128). However, we found that the inclusion of algorithm features did not lead to an improvement in overall NDCG@10 over the meta learner using only user features (0.144). While adding algorithm features to the meta-learner did improve its Top-1 selection accuracy (+16.1%), this was counterbalanced by leading to a lower Top-3 accuracy (-10.7%). We conclude that for the per-user algorithm selection task in recommender systems, the predictive power of user features is overwhelmingly dominant. While algorithm features improve selection precision, unlocking their potential to boost overall performance remains a non-trivial challenge.</p></details> |  |

Recently, to optimize long-term user satisfaction, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used for MTF in RSs. However, the existing offline RL algorithms used for MTF have the following severe problems: a) To avoid Out-of-Distribution (OOD), their constraints are overly strict, which seriously damage performance; b) They are unaware of the exploration policy used to collect training data, only suboptimal policy can be learned; c) Their exploration policies are inefficient and hurt user experience. To solve the above problems, we propose an innovative method called UnifiedRL tailored for MTF in large-scale RSs. UnifiedRL seamlessly integrates offline RL model with its custom exploration policy to relax overly strict constraints, which is different from existing RL-MTF methods and significantly improves performance. In addition, compared to existing exploration policies, UnifiedRL's custom exploration policy is highly efficient, enabling frequent online exploration and offline training iterations, which further improves performance. Extensive offline and online experiments are conducted in a large-scale RS. The results demonstrate that UnifiedRL outperforms other existing MTF methods remarkably, achieving a +4.64% increase in user valid consumption and a +1.74% increase in user duration time. To the best of our knowledge, UnifiedRL is the first RL algorithm tailored for MTF in RSs and has been successfully deployed in multiple large-scale RSs since June 2023, yielding significant benefits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Model Evolutionary Algorithms for Recommender Systems: Benchmarks and Algorithm Comparisons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10697v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolutionary computing community, the remarkable language-handling capabilities and reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the functionality of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), enabling them to tackle optimization problems involving structured language or program code. Although this field is still in its early stages, its impressive potential has led to the development of various LLM-based EAs. To effectively evaluate the performance and practical applicability of these LLM-based EAs, benchmarks with real-world relevance are essential. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based recommender systems (RSs) and introduce a benchmark problem set, named RSBench, specifically designed to assess the performance of LLM-based EAs in recommendation prompt optimization. RSBench emphasizes session-based recommendations, aiming to discover a set of Pareto optimal prompts that guide the recommendation process, providing accurate, diverse, and fair recommendations. We develop three LLM-based EAs based on established EA frameworks and experimentally evaluate their performance using RSBench. Our study offers valuable insights into the application of EAs in LLM-based RSs. Additionally, we explore key components that may influence the overall performance of the RS, providing meaningful guidance for future research on the development of LLM-based EAs in RSs. The source code of the proposed RSBench can be found at https://github.com/LiuJ-2023/RSBench/tree/main.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal-enhanced Federated Recommendation: A Group-wise Fusion Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19955v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Recommendation (FR) is a new learning paradigm to tackle the learn-to-rank problem in a privacy-preservation manner. How to integrate multi-modality features into federated recommendation is still an open challenge in terms of efficiency, distribution heterogeneity, and fine-grained alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal fusion mechanism in federated recommendation settings (GFMFR). Specifically, it offloads multimodal representation learning to the server, which stores item content and employs a high-capacity encoder to generate expressive representations, alleviating client-side overhead. Moreover, a group-aware item representation fusion approach enables fine-grained knowledge sharing among similar users while retaining individual preferences. The proposed fusion loss could be simply plugged into any existing federated recommender systems empowering their capability by adding multi-modality features. Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that GFMFR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal FR baselines.</p></details> |  |

While powerful models like Target Attention (TA) excel at capturing complex feature interactions in the ranking stage, their high computational cost makes them infeasible for pre-ranking, which often relies on simplistic vector-product models. This disparity creates a significant performance bottleneck for the entire system. To bridge this gap, we propose TARQ, a novel pre-ranking framework. Inspired by generative models, TARQ's key innovation is to equip pre-ranking with an architecture approximate to TA by Residual Quantization. This allows us to bring the modeling power of TA into the latency-critical pre-ranking stage for the first time, establishing a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Extensive offline experiments and large-scale online A/B tests at Taobao demonstrate TARQ's significant improvements in ranking performance. Consequently, our model has been fully deployed in production, serving tens of millions of daily active users and yielding substantial business improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to WSDM 2026 Short Paper Track</p></details> |

We introduce GSPRec, a graph spectral model that integrates temporal transitions through sequentially-informed graph construction and applies frequency-aware filtering in the spectral domain. GSPRec encodes item transitions via multi-hop diffusion to enable the use of symmetric Laplacians for spectral processing. To capture user preferences, we design a dual-filtering mechanism: a Gaussian bandpass filter to extract mid-frequency, user-level patterns, and a low-pass filter to retain global trends. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that GSPRec consistently outperforms baselines, with an average improvement of 6.77% in NDCG@10. Ablation studies show the complementary benefits of both sequential graph augmentation and bandpass filtering.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Hidden Cost of Defaults in Recommender System Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21180v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperparameter optimization is critical for improving the performance of recommender systems, yet its implementation is often treated as a neutral or secondary concern. In this work, we shift focus from model benchmarking to auditing the behavior of RecBole, a widely used recommendation framework. We show that RecBole's internal defaults, particularly an undocumented early-stopping policy, can prematurely terminate Random Search and Bayesian Optimization. This limits search coverage in ways that are not visible to users. Using six models and two datasets, we compare search strategies and quantify both performance variance and search path instability. Our findings reveal that hidden framework logic can introduce variability comparable to the differences between search strategies. These results highlight the importance of treating frameworks as active components of experimental design and call for more transparent, reproducibility-aware tooling in recommender systems research. We provide actionable recommendations for researchers and developers to mitigate hidden configuration behaviors and improve the transparency of hyperparameter tuning workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RecSys 2025</p></details> |

However, lots of users' interests are sparse due to lacking consumption behaviors, making it challenging to provide accurate recommendations for them, which is widespread in large-scale RSs. In particular, efficiently solving this problem in the ranking stage of RS is an even greater challenge, which requires an end-to-end and real-time approach. To solve this problem, we propose an innovative method called Dynamic User Interest Augmentation (DUIA). DUIA enhances user interest including user profile and user history behavior sequences by generating enhancement vectors and personalized enhancement vectors through dynamic stream clustering of similar users and relevant items from multiple perspectives. To realize stream clustering, we specially design an algorithm called Gradient-based Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm (GHCA) for DUIA, which performs clustering via gradient descent and stores the cluster centers in memory networks. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate that DUIA not only significantly improves model performance for users with sparse interests but also delivers notable gains for other users. As an end-to-end method, DUIA can be easily integrated with existing models. Furthermore, DUIA is also used for long-tail items and cold-start problem, which also yields excellent improvements. Since 2022, DUIA has been successfully deployed in multiple industrial RSs in Tencent and was made public in May 2024. Moreover, the thoughts behind DUIA, dynamic stream clustering and similarity-based enhancement, have inspired relevant works and have also been applied in other stages of RS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Branch Network Architectures to Close the Modality Gap in Multimodal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18807v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommender systems rely on collaborative filtering, using past user-item interactions to help users discover new items in a vast collection. In cold start, i.e., when interaction histories of users or items are not available, content-based recommender systems use side information instead. Hybrid recommender systems (HRSs) often employ multimodal learning to combine collaborative and side information, which we jointly refer to as modalities. Though HRSs can provide recommendations when some modalities are missing, their quality degrades. In this work, we utilize single-branch neural networks equipped with weight sharing, modality sampling, and contrastive loss to provide accurate recommendations even in missing modality scenarios by narrowing the modality gap. We compare these networks with multi-branch alternatives and conduct extensive experiments on three datasets. Six accuracy-based and four beyond-accuracy-based metrics help assess the recommendation quality for the different training paradigms and their hyperparameters in warm-start and missing modality scenarios. We quantitatively and qualitatively study the effects of these different aspects on bridging the modality gap. Our results show that single-branch networks achieve competitive performance in warm-start scenarios and are significantly better in missing modality settings. Moreover, our approach leads to closer proximity of an item's modalities in the embedding space. Our full experimental setup is available at https://github.com/hcai-mms/single-branch-networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (TORS)</p></details> |

This paper addresses the challenge of defining noise, which is inherently related to variability in human preferences and behaviors. In classifying changes in user tendencies, we distinguish three kinds of phenomena: external factors that directly influence users' sentiment, serendipity causing unexpected preference, and incidental interaction perceived as noise. To overcome these problems, we present a new framework that identifies noisy ratings. In this context, the proposed framework is modular, consisting of three layers: known natural noise algorithms for item classification, an Ensemble learning model for refined evaluation of the items and signature-based noise identification. We further advocate the metrics that quantitatively assess serendipity and group validation, offering higher robustness in recommendation accuracy. Our approach aims to provide a cleaner training dataset that would inherently improve user satisfaction and engagement with Recommender Systems.</p></details> | 32 pages |

Yet, despite a surge of interest, the field lacks a principled understanding of the capabilities of LLMs in their interaction with graph data. In this work, we conduct a large-scale, controlled evaluation across several key axes of variability to systematically assess the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based graph reasoning methods in text-based applications. The axes include the LLM-graph interaction mode, comparing prompting, tool-use, and code generation; dataset domains, spanning citation, web-link, e-commerce, and social networks; structural regimes contrasting homophilic and heterophilic graphs; feature characteristics involving both short- and long-text node attributes; and model configurations with varying LLM sizes and reasoning capabilities. We further analyze dependencies by methodically truncating features, deleting edges, and removing labels to quantify reliance on input types. Our findings provide practical and actionable guidance. (1) LLMs as code generators achieve the strongest overall performance on graph data, with especially large gains on long-text or high-degree graphs where prompting quickly exceeds the token budget. (2) All interaction strategies remain effective on heterophilic graphs, challenging the assumption that LLM-based methods collapse under low homophily. (3) Code generation is able to flexibly adapt its reliance between structure, features, or labels to leverage the most informative input type. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive view of the strengths and limitations of current LLM-graph interaction modes and highlight key design principles for future approaches.</p></details> |  |

From a first principle perspective, the breakthroughs of LLMs stem not only from their architectures but also from two complementary mechanisms: context engineering, which enriches raw input queries with contextual cues to better elicit model capabilities, and multi-step reasoning, which iteratively refines model outputs through intermediate reasoning paths. However, these two mechanisms and their potential to unlock substantial improvements remain largely underexplored in industrial ranking systems. In this paper, we propose OnePiece, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into both retrieval and ranking models of industrial cascaded pipelines. OnePiece is built on a pure Transformer backbone and further introduces three key innovations: (1) structured context engineering, which augments interaction history with preference and scenario signals and unifies them into a structured tokenized input sequence for both retrieval and ranking; (2) block-wise latent reasoning, which equips the model with multi-step refinement of representations and scales reasoning bandwidth via block size; (3) progressive multi-task training, which leverages user feedback chains to effectively supervise reasoning steps during training. OnePiece has been deployed in the main personalized search scenario of Shopee and achieves consistent online gains across different key business metrics, including over $+2\%$ GMV/UU and a $+2.90\%$ increase in advertising revenue.</p></details> | <details><summary>OnePi...</summary><p>OnePiece Technical Report; Applied in Shopee</p></details> |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) possess the world knowledge and multimodal understanding needed for serendipity, but their integration into billion-item-scale platforms presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework where fine-tuned MLLMs provide high-level guidance to conventional recommendation models, steering them towards more serendipitous suggestions. This approach leverages MLLM strengths in understanding multimodal content and user interests while retaining the efficiency of traditional models for item-level recommendation. This mitigates the complexity of applying MLLMs directly to vast action spaces. We also demonstrate a chain-of-thought strategy enabling MLLMs to discover novel user interests by first understanding video content and then identifying relevant yet unexplored interest clusters. Through live experiments within a commercial short-form video platform serving billions of users, we show that our MLLM-powered approach significantly improves both recommendation serendipity and user satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 Recsys EARL Workshop</p></details> |

However, existing solutions either require domain-specific engineering, which limits flexibility, or rely solely on large language models, which increases the risk of hallucination. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) holds promise, its naive use in CRS is hindered by noisy dialogues that weaken retrieval and by overlooked nuances among similar items. We propose ReGeS, a reciprocal Retrieval-Generation Synergy framework that unifies generation-augmented retrieval to distill informative user intent from conversations and retrieval-augmented generation to differentiate subtle item features. This synergy obviates the need for extra annotations, reduces hallucinations, and simplifies continuous updates. Experiments on multiple CRS benchmarks show that ReGeS achieves state-of-the-art performance in recommendation accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of reciprocal synergy for knowledge-intensive CRS tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WISE 2025: 26th International Web Information Systems Engineering conference.

While ALS is widely used for providing personalized recommendations based on user-item interaction data, its high computational cost, stemming from repeated regression operations, poses significant challenges for large-scale datasets. To enhance the efficiency of ALS, we propose a core-elements subsampling method that selects a representative subset of data and leverages sparse matrix operations to approximate ALS estimations efficiently. We establish theoretical guarantees for the approximation and convergence of the proposed approach, showing that it achieves similar accuracy with significantly reduced computational time compared to full-data ALS. Extensive simulations and real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various scenarios, emphasizing its potential in large-scale recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |

Past research on predicting the popularity of individual products suggests the existence of intrinsic prediction limits. However, little is known about the limits for predicting collective attention across cultural products. Here, we analyze four years of nationwide library loan data for approximately 2 million individuals, comprising over 100 million loans of more than 660,000 unique books. We find that culture, as measured by popularity distributions of loaned books, drifts continually from month to month at a near-constant rate, leading to a growing divergence over time, and that drifts vary between different book genres. By linking book loans to registry data, we investigate the influence of age, sex, educational level, and geographical area on cultural drift, finding heterogeneous effects from the different demographic groups. Our findings have important implications for market forecasting and developing robust recommender systems, highlighting the need to account for specific drift dynamics for different types of items and demographic groups.</p></details> |  |

Traditional recommendation systems often suffer from two limitations: (1) reliance on limited supervised signals derived from explicit user feedback, and (2) vulnerability to noisy or unintentional interactions. To address these challenges, we propose SeqUDA-Rec, a novel deep learning framework that integrates user behavior sequences with global unsupervised data augmentation to enhance recommendation accuracy and robustness. Our approach first constructs a Global User-Item Interaction Graph (GUIG) from all user behavior sequences, capturing both local and global item associations. Then, a graph contrastive learning module is applied to generate robust embeddings, while a sequential Transformer-based encoder models users' evolving preferences. To further enhance diversity and counteract sparse supervised labels, we employ a GAN-based augmentation strategy, generating plausible interaction patterns and supplementing training data. Extensive experiments on two real-world marketing datasets (Amazon Ads and TikTok Ad Clicks) demonstrate that SeqUDA-Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as SASRec, BERT4Rec, and GCL4SR. Our model achieves a 6.7% improvement in NDCG@10 and 11.3% improvement in HR@10, proving its effectiveness in personalized advertising and intelligent content recommendation.</p></details> |  |

We seek to understand interactions with niche items in benchmark recommendation datasets as a step toward mitigating popularity bias. We find that, compared to mainstream users, niche-preferring users exhibit a longer-tailed activity-level distribution, indicating the existence of users who both prefer niche items and exhibit high activity levels. We partition users along two axes: (1) activity level ("power" vs. "light") and (2) item-popularity preference ("mainstream" vs. "niche"), and show that in several benchmark datasets, the number of power-niche users (high activity and niche preference) is statistically significantly larger than expected under a null configuration model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a framework for reweighting the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss that simultaneously reweights based on user activity level and item popularity. Our method introduces two interpretable parameters: one controlling the significance of user activity level, and the other of item popularity. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that upweighting power-niche users reduces popularity bias and can increase overall performance. In contrast to previous work that only considers user activity level or item popularity in isolation, our results suggest that considering their interaction leads to Pareto-dominant performance.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems risk reinforcing filter bubbles and political polarization by failing to incorporate diverse perspectives. Stance detection -- identifying a text's position on a target -- can help mitigate this by enabling viewpoint-aware recommendations and data-driven analyses of media bias. Yet, existing stance detection research remains largely limited to short texts and high-resource languages. To address these gaps, we introduce \textsc{K-News-Stance}, the first Korean dataset for article-level stance detection, comprising 2,000 news articles with article-level and 21,650 segment-level stance annotations across 47 societal issues. We also propose \textsc{JoA-ICL}, a \textbf{Jo}urnalism-guided \textbf{A}gentic \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{L}earning framework that employs a language model agent to predict the stances of key structural segments (e.g., leads, quotations), which are then aggregated to infer the overall article stance. Experiments showed that \textsc{JoA-ICL} outperforms existing stance detection methods, highlighting the benefits of segment-level agency in capturing the overall position of long-form news articles. Two case studies further demonstrate its broader utility in promoting viewpoint diversity in news recommendations and uncovering patterns of media bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (24 pages)</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches rely on static user profiling, neglecting the temporal and dynamic nature of user interests. This limitation stems from a disconnect between language modelling and behaviour modelling, which constrains the capacity of agents to represent sequential patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Temporal-aware Agent-based simulator for Recommender Systems, DyTA4Rec, which enables agents to model and utilise evolving user behaviour based on historical interactions. DyTA4Rec features a dynamic updater for real-time profile refinement, temporal-enhanced prompting for sequential context, and self-adaptive aggregation for coherent feedback. Experimental results at group and individual levels show that DyTA4Rec significantly improves the alignment between simulated and actual user behaviour by modelling dynamic characteristics and enhancing temporal awareness in LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[USB-Rec: An Effective Framework for Improving Conversational Recommendation Capability of Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20381v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework, User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy (SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Recsys'25</p></details> |

Personalized Large Language Models (PLLMs) tackle these challenges by leveraging individual user data, such as user profiles, historical dialogues, content, and interactions, to deliver responses that are contextually relevant and tailored to each user's specific needs. This is a highly valuable research topic, as PLLMs can significantly enhance user satisfaction and have broad applications in conversational agents, recommendation systems, emotion recognition, medical assistants, and more. This survey reviews recent advancements in PLLMs from three technical perspectives: prompting for personalized context (input level), finetuning for personalized adapters (model level), and alignment for personalized preferences (objective level). To provide deeper insights, we also discuss current limitations and outline several promising directions for future research.

| **[TransRec: Learning Transferable Recommendation from Mixture-of-Modality Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06190v3)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning large-scale pre-trained models on broad-ranging data and then transfer to a wide range of target tasks has become the de facto paradigm in many machine learning (ML) communities. Such big models are not only strong performers in practice but also offer a promising way to break out of the task-specific modeling restrictions, thereby enabling task-agnostic and unified ML systems. However, such a popular paradigm is mainly unexplored by the recommender systems (RS) community. A critical issue is that standard recommendation models are primarily built on categorical identity features. That is, the users and the interacted items are represented by their unique IDs, which are generally not shareable across different systems or platforms. To pursue the transferable recommendations, we propose studying pre-trained RS models in a novel scenario where a user's interaction feedback involves a mixture-of-modality (MoM) items, e.g., text and images. We then present TransRec, a very simple modification made on the popular ID-based RS framework. TransRec learns directly from the raw features of the MoM items in an end-to-end training manner and thus enables effective transfer learning under various scenarios without relying on overlapped users or items. We empirically study the transferring ability of TransRec across four different real-world recommendation settings. Besides, we look at its effects by scaling source and target data size. Our results suggest that learning neural recommendation models from MoM feedback provides a promising way to realize universal RS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Long-term User Behaviors with Diffusion-driven Multi-interest Network for CTR Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15311v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CTR (Click-Through Rate) prediction, crucial for recommender systems and online advertising, etc., has been confirmed to benefit from modeling long-term user behaviors. Nonetheless, the vast number of behaviors and complexity of noise interference pose challenges to prediction efficiency and effectiveness. Recent solutions have evolved from single-stage models to two-stage models. However, current two-stage models often filter out significant information, resulting in an inability to capture diverse user interests and build the complete latent space of user interests. Inspired by multi-interest and generative modeling, we propose DiffuMIN (Diffusion-driven Multi-Interest Network) to model long-term user behaviors and thoroughly explore the user interest space. Specifically, we propose a target-oriented multi-interest extraction method that begins by orthogonally decomposing the target to obtain interest channels. This is followed by modeling the relationships between interest channels and user behaviors to disentangle and extract multiple user interests. We then adopt a diffusion module guided by contextual interests and interest channels, which anchor users' personalized and target-oriented interest types, enabling the generation of augmented interests that align with the latent spaces of user interests, thereby further exploring restricted interest space. Finally, we leverage contrastive learning to ensure that the generated augmented interests align with users' genuine preferences. Extensive offline experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, yielding results that demonstrate the superiority of DiffuMIN. Moreover, DiffuMIN increased CTR by 1.52% and CPM by 1.10% in online A/B testing. Our source code is available at https://github.com/laiweijiang/DiffuMIN.</p></details> |  |

Most research in RS tends to focus either on predicting users' immediate feedback (like click-through rate) accurately or improving users' long-term engagement. However, they ignore the influence for authors and the lifelong interaction value (LIV) of user-author pairs, which is particularly crucial for improving the prosperity of social community in short-video platforms. Currently, reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize long-term benefits and has been widely applied in RS. In this paper, we introduce RL to Reinforce Lifelong Interaction Value of User-Author pairs (RLIV-UA) based on each interaction of UA pairs. To address the long intervals between UA interactions and the large scale of the UA space, we propose a novel Sparse Cross-Request Interaction Markov Decision Process (SCRI-MDP) and introduce an Adjacent State Approximation (ASA) method to construct RL training samples. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Task Critic Learning (MTCL) to capture the progressive nature of UA interactions (click -> follow -> gift), where denser interaction signals are leveraged to compensate for the learning of sparse labels. Finally, an auxiliary supervised learning task is designed to enhance the convergence of the RLIV-UA model. In offline experiments and online A/B tests, the RLIV-UA model achieves both higher user satisfaction and higher platform profits than compared methods.</p></details> |  |

A Systematic Analysis of Prompts, Models, and Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14979v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantic features has been demonstrated as a powerful paradigm for enhancing Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS). This typically involves three stages: processing item text, extracting features with LLMs, and adapting them for downstream models. However, existing methods vary widely in prompting, architecture, and adaptation strategies, making it difficult to fairly compare design choices and identify what truly drives performance. In this work, we propose RecXplore, a modular analytical framework that decomposes the LLM-as-feature-extractor pipeline into four modules: data processing, semantic feature extraction, feature adaptation, and sequential modeling. Instead of proposing new techniques, RecXplore revisits and organizes established methods, enabling systematic exploration of each module in isolation. Experiments on four public datasets show that simply combining the best designs from existing techniques without exhaustive search yields up to 18.7% relative improvement in NDCG@5 and 12.7% in HR@5 over strong baselines. These results underscore the utility of modular benchmarking for identifying effective design patterns and promoting standardized research in LLM-enhanced recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages.

| **[REG4Rec: Reasoning-Enhanced Generative Model for Large-Scale Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15308v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation aims to predict a user's next action in large-scale recommender systems. While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient information interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially address this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture user intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into generative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance. However, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic representations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning pathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these issues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that constructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a self-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations. Specifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook (MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby constructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance the reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement stage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a Multi-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions tailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA introduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization. During inference, Consistency-Oriented Self-Reflection for Pruning (CORP) is proposed to discard inconsistent reasoning paths, preventing the propagation of erroneous reasoning. Lastly, we develop an efficient offline training strategy for large-scale recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets and online evaluations show that REG4Rec delivers outstanding performance and substantial practical value.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have proposed methods to measure and mitigate such biases -- but translating academic theory into practice is inherently challenging. RS practitioners must balance the competing interests of diverse stakeholders, including providers and users, and operate in dynamic environments. Through a semi-structured interview study (N=11), we map the RS practitioner workflow within large technology companies, focusing on how technical teams consider fairness internally and in collaboration with other (legal, data, and fairness) teams. We identify key challenges to incorporating fairness into existing RS workflows: defining fairness in RS contexts, particularly when navigating multi-stakeholder and dynamic fairness considerations. We also identify key organization-wide challenges: making time for fairness work and facilitating cross-team communication. Finally, we offer actionable recommendations for the RS community, including HCI researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

We introduce OBER-an Outcome-Based Educational Recommender that embeds learning outcomes and assessment items directly into the data schema, so any algorithm can be evaluated on the mastery it fosters. OBER uses a minimalist entity-relation model, a log-driven mastery formula, and a plug-in architecture. Integrated into an e-learning system in non-formal domain, it was evaluated trough a two-week randomized split test with over 5 700 learners across three methods: fixed expert trajectory, collaborative filtering (CF), and knowledge-based (KB) filtering. CF maximized retention, but the fixed path achieved the highest mastery. Because OBER derives business, relevance, and learning metrics from the same logs, it lets practitioners weigh relevance and engagement against outcome mastery with no extra testing overhead. The framework is method-agnostic and readily extensible to future adaptive or context-aware recommenders.</p></details> |  |

Accordingly, we generalize existing contribution function principles for set contribution functions and provide a corresponding principle-based analysis. We introduce new principles specific to set-based functions that focus on properties pertaining to the interaction of arguments within a set. Finally, we sketch how the principles play out across different set contribution functions given a recommendation system application scenario.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Real-World Aligned Benchmark for Unlearning in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17076v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern recommender systems heavily leverage user interaction data to deliver personalized experiences. However, relying on personal data presents challenges in adhering to privacy regulations, such as the GDPR's "right to be forgotten". Machine unlearning (MU) aims to address these challenges by enabling the efficient removal of specific training data from models post-training, without compromising model utility or leaving residual information. However, current benchmarks for unlearning in recommender systems -- most notably CURE4Rec -- fail to reflect real-world operational demands. They focus narrowly on collaborative filtering, overlook tasks like session-based and next-basket recommendation, simulate unrealistically large unlearning requests, and ignore critical efficiency constraints. In this paper, we propose a set of design desiderata and research questions to guide the development of a more realistic benchmark for unlearning in recommender systems, with the goal of gathering feedback from the research community. Our benchmark proposal spans multiple recommendation tasks, includes domain-specific unlearning scenarios, and several unlearning algorithms -- including ones adapted from a recent NeurIPS unlearning competition. Furthermore, we argue for an unlearning setup that reflects the sequential, time-sensitive nature of real-world deletion requests. We also present a preliminary experiment in a next-basket recommendation setting based on our proposed desiderata and find that unlearning also works for sequential recommendation models, exposed to many small unlearning requests. In this case, we observe that a modification of a custom-designed unlearning algorithm for recommender systems outperforms general unlearning algorithms significantly, and that unlearning can be executed with a latency of only several seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unified and Adaptive Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering via Graph Signal Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12374v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a foundational approach in recommender systems, but it struggles with challenges such as data sparsity and the cold-start problem. Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has emerged as a promising solution by leveraging dense domains to improve recommendations in sparse target domains. However, existing CDR methods face significant limitations, including their reliance on overlapping users as a bridge between domains and their inability to address domain sensitivity, i.e., differences in user behaviors and characteristics across domains, effectively. To overcome these limitations, we propose CGSP, a unified and adaptive CDR framework based on graph signal processing (GSP). CGSP supports both intra-domain and inter-domain recommendations while adaptively controlling the influence of the source domain through a simple hyperparameter. The framework constructs a cross-domain similarity graph by integrating target-only and source-bridged similarity graphs to capture both intra-domain and inter-domain relationships. This graph is then processed through graph filtering techniques to propagate and enhance local signals. Finally, personalized graph signals are constructed, tailored separately for users in the source and target domains, enabling CGSP to function as a unified framework for CDR scenarios. Extensive evaluation shows that CGSP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse cross-domain settings, with notable gains in low-overlap scenarios, underscoring its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

These systems also serve as components of dialogue, question-answering, and recommender systems. The trajectory of IR has evolved dynamically from its origins in term-based methods to its integration with advanced neural models. While the neural models excel at capturing complex contextual signals and semantic nuances, thereby reshaping the IR landscape, they still face challenges such as data scarcity, interpretability, and the generation of contextually plausible yet potentially inaccurate responses. This evolution requires a combination of both traditional methods (such as term-based sparse retrieval methods with rapid response) and modern neural architectures (such as language models with powerful language understanding capacity). Meanwhile, the emergence of large language models (LLMs), typified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized natural language processing due to their remarkable language understanding, generation, generalization, and reasoning abilities. Consequently, recent research has sought to leverage LLMs to improve IR systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research trajectory, it is necessary to consolidate existing methodologies and provide nuanced insights through a comprehensive overview. In this survey, we delve into the confluence of LLMs and IR systems, including crucial aspects such as query rewriters, retrievers, rerankers, and readers. Additionally, we explore promising directions, such as search agents, within this expanding field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated to version 4; Accepted by ACM TOIS</p></details> |

Motivated by applications in clinical trials and recommendation systems, we assume that two arms are connected if and only if they are similar (i.e., their means are close to each other). We establish a regret lower bound for this problem under the novel feedback structure and introduce two upper confidence bound (UCB)-based algorithms: Double-UCB, which has problem-independent regret upper bounds, and Conservative-UCB, which has problem-dependent upper bounds. Leveraging the similarity structure, we also explore a scenario where the number of arms increases over time (referred to as the \emph{ballooning setting}). Practical applications of this scenario include Q\&A platforms (e.g., Reddit, Stack Overflow, Quora) and product reviews on platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, where answers (or reviews) continuously appear, and the goal is to display the best ones at the top. We extend these two UCB-based algorithms to the ballooning setting. Under mild assumptions, we provide regret upper bounds for both algorithms and discuss their sub-linearity. Furthermore, we propose a new version of the corresponding algorithms that do not rely on prior knowledge of the graph's structural information and provide regret upper bounds. Finally, we conduct experiments to validate the theoretical results.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.11171</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Cold-Start Recommendation via BPE Token-Level Embedding Initialization with LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13179v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems, especially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new users or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as conventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment with shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation strategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by applying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained token-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to using coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can be used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate recommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our mechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over benchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings show that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit Rate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same capability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more interpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The practical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight, but nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the zero-shot setting is indicated within this work.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, the recommender systems community hardly understands, addresses, and evaluates the environmental impact of their work. In this study, we examine the environmental impact of recommender systems research by reproducing typical experimental pipelines. Based on our results, we provide guidelines for researchers and practitioners on how to minimize the environmental footprint of their work and implement green recommender systems - recommender systems designed to minimize their energy consumption and carbon footprint. Our analysis covers 79 papers from the 2013 and 2023 ACM RecSys conferences, comparing traditional "good old-fashioned AI" models with modern deep learning models. We designed and reproduced representative experimental pipelines for both years, measuring energy consumption using a hardware energy meter and converting it into CO2 equivalents. Our results show that papers utilizing deep learning models emit approximately 42 times more CO2 equivalents than papers using traditional models. On average, a single deep learning-based paper generates 2,909 kilograms of CO2 equivalents - more than the carbon emissions of a person flying from New York City to Melbourne or the amount of CO2 sequestered by one tree over 260 years. This work underscores the urgent need for the recommender systems and wider machine learning communities to adopt green AI principles, balancing algorithmic advancements and environmental responsibility to build a sustainable future with AI-powered personalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Just ...</summary><p>Just Accepted at ACM TORS. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2408.08203</p></details> |
| **[A Learnable Fully Interacted Two-Tower Model for Pre-Ranking System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12948v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-ranking plays a crucial role in large-scale recommender systems by significantly improving the efficiency and scalability within the constraints of providing high-quality candidate sets in real time. The two-tower model is widely used in pre-ranking systems due to a good balance between efficiency and effectiveness with decoupled architecture, which independently processes user and item inputs before calculating their interaction (e.g. dot product or similarity measure). However, this independence also leads to the lack of information interaction between the two towers, resulting in less effectiveness. In this paper, a novel architecture named learnable Fully Interacted Two-tower Model (FIT) is proposed, which enables rich information interactions while ensuring inference efficiency. FIT mainly consists of two parts: Meta Query Module (MQM) and Lightweight Similarity Scorer (LSS). Specifically, MQM introduces a learnable item meta matrix to achieve expressive early interaction between user and item features. Moreover, LSS is designed to further obtain effective late interaction between the user and item towers. Finally, experimental results on several public datasets show that our proposed FIT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline pre-ranking models.</p></details> |  |

However, compared to the rapid developments in the AI community, recommendation systems have not achieved a breakthrough in recent years. For instance, they still rely on a multi-stage cascaded architecture rather than an end-to-end approach, leading to computational fragmentation and optimization inconsistencies, and hindering the effective application of key breakthrough technologies from the AI community in recommendation scenarios. To address these issues, we propose OneRec, which reshapes the recommendation system through an end-to-end generative approach and achieves promising results. Firstly, we have enhanced the computational FLOPs of the current recommendation model by 10 $\times$ and have identified the scaling laws for recommendations within certain boundaries. Secondly, reinforcement learning techniques, previously difficult to apply for optimizing recommendations, show significant potential in this framework. Lastly, through infrastructure optimizations, we have achieved 23.7% and 28.8% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) on flagship GPUs during training and inference, respectively, aligning closely with the LLM community. This architecture significantly reduces communication and storage overhead, resulting in operating expense that is only 10.6% of traditional recommendation pipelines. Deployed in Kuaishou/Kuaishou Lite APP, it handles 25% of total queries per second, enhancing overall App Stay Time by 0.54% and 1.24%, respectively. Additionally, we have observed significant increases in metrics such as 7-day Lifetime, which is a crucial indicator of recommendation experience. We also provide practical lessons and insights derived from developing, optimizing, and maintaining a production-scale recommendation system with significant real-world impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed alphabetically by their first name</p></details> |

OneRec reformulates recommendation as an autoregressive generation task, achieving high Model FLOPs Utilization. While OneRec-V1 has shown significant empirical success in real-world deployment, two critical challenges hinder its scalability and performance: (1) inefficient computational allocation where 97.66% of resources are consumed by sequence encoding rather than generation, and (2) limitations in reinforcement learning relying solely on reward models. To address these challenges, we propose OneRec-V2, featuring: (1) Lazy Decoder-Only Architecture: Eliminates encoder bottlenecks, reducing total computation by 94% and training resources by 90%, enabling successful scaling to 8B parameters. (2) Preference Alignment with Real-World User Interactions: Incorporates Duration-Aware Reward Shaping and Adaptive Ratio Clipping to better align with user preferences using real-world feedback. Extensive A/B tests on Kuaishou demonstrate OneRec-V2's effectiveness, improving App Stay Time by 0.467%/0.741% while balancing multi-objective recommendations. This work advances generative recommendation scalability and alignment with real-world feedback, representing a step forward in the development of end-to-end recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

However, current neural network-based models often incur significant computational overhead due to the complex training process required to learn and integrate information from multiple modalities. To address this challenge,we propose MultiModal-Graph Filtering (MM-GF), a training-free method grounded in graph filtering (GF) for efficient and accurate multimodal recommendations. Specifically, MM-GF first constructs multiple similarity graphs for two distinct modalities as well as user-item interaction data. Then, MM-GF optimally fuses these multimodal signals using a polynomial graph filter that allows for precise control of the frequency response by adjusting frequency bounds. Furthermore, the filter coefficients are treated as hyperparameters, enabling flexible and data-driven adaptation. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GF not only improves recommendation accuracy by up to 22.25% compared to the best competitor but also dramatically reduces computational costs by achieving the runtime of less than 10 seconds.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high. We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2 and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system comparisons. Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically principled, evaluation framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EARL 25: The 2nd Workshop on Evaluating and Applying Recommender Systems with Large Language Models at RecSys 2025</p></details> |

Our experience highlights several unexpected challenges encountered in building personalization features that are commonly found in products from news aggregators and publishers, and shows how those difficulties are connected to surprising gaps in the literature. Finally, we offer a set of lessons learned from building a live system with a persistent user base and highlight opportunities to make future news recommendation research more applicable and impactful in practice.</p></details> |  |

However, despite significant research advances, state-of-the-art VQ methods still face challenges in balancing encoding efficiency and quantization accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VQ method called SAQ. To improve accuracy, SAQ employs a new dimension segmentation technique to strategically partition PCA-projected vectors into segments along their dimensions. By prioritizing leading dimension segments with larger magnitudes, SAQ allocates more bits to high-impact segments, optimizing the use of the available space quota. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed to optimize dimension segmentation and bit allocation, ensuring minimal quantization error. To speed up vector encoding, SAQ devises a code adjustment technique to first quantize each dimension independently and then progressively refine quantized vectors using a coordinate-descent-like approach to avoid exhaustive enumeration. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAQ's superiority over classical methods (e.g., PQ, PCA) and recent state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., LVQ, Extended RabitQ). SAQ achieves up to 80% reduction in quantization error and accelerates encoding speed by over 80x compared to Extended RabitQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, accepted by SIGMOD</p></details> |
| **[AEFS: Adaptive Early Feature Selection for Deep Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12076v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature selection has emerged as a crucial technique in refining recommender systems. Recent advancements leveraging Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has drawn significant attention, particularly in two main categories: early feature selection and late feature selection, differentiated by whether the selection occurs before or after the embedding layer. The early feature selection selects a fixed subset of features and retrains the model, while the late feature selection, known as adaptive feature selection, dynamically adjusts feature choices for each data instance, recognizing the variability in feature significance. Although adaptive feature selection has shown remarkable improvements in performance, its main drawback lies in its post-embedding layer feature selection. This process often becomes cumbersome and inefficient in large-scale recommender systems with billions of ID-type features, leading to a highly sparse and parameter-heavy embedding layer. To overcome this, we introduce Adaptive Early Feature Selection (AEFS), a very simple method that not only adaptively selects informative features for each instance, but also significantly reduces the activated parameters of the embedding layer. AEFS employs a dual-model architecture, encompassing an auxiliary model dedicated to feature selection and a main model responsible for prediction. To ensure effective alignment between these two models, we incorporate two collaborative training loss constraints. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. Notably, AEFS matches the performance of current state-of-theart Adaptive Late Feature Selection methods while achieving a significant reduction of 37. 5% in the activated parameters of the embedding layer. AEFS is open-source at https://github. com/fly-dragon211/AEFS .</p></details> | Accepted by TKDE |

Existing methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item interaction network for further improving social recommendation. To address these issues, we introduce a social \underline{r}ecommendation model with ro\underline{bu}st g\underline{r}aph denoisin\underline{g}-augmentation fusion and multi-s\underline{e}mantic Modeling(Burger). Specifically, we firstly propose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of the model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference, respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling, we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration. Extensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Existing methods that extend conformal prediction to sequential data rely on fitting a relatively complex model to capture temporal dependencies. However, these methods can fail if the sample size is small and often require expensive retraining when the underlying data distribution changes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Reservoir Conformal Prediction (ResCP), a novel training-free conformal prediction method for time series. Our approach leverages the efficiency and representation learning capabilities of reservoir computing to dynamically reweight conformity scores. In particular, we compute similarity scores among reservoir states and use them to adaptively reweight the observed residuals at each step. With this approach, ResCP enables us to account for local temporal dynamics when modeling the error distribution without compromising computational scalability. We prove that, under reasonable assumptions, ResCP achieves asymptotic conditional coverage, and we empirically demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

Federated learning (FL) avoids central aggregation by training on distributed clients but remains sensitive to class imbalance, non-IID client distributions, and limited labeled samples. We propose FedSSL-AMC, which trains a causal, time-dilated CNN with triplet-loss self-supervision on unlabeled I/Q sequences across clients, followed by per-client SVMs on small labeled sets. We establish convergence of the federated representation learning procedure and a separability guarantee for the downstream classifier under feature noise. Experiments on synthetic and over-the-air datasets show consistent gains over supervised FL baselines under heterogeneous SNR, carrier-frequency offsets, and non-IID label partitions.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS) tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000} of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data, together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles, facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a standardized benchmark for underwater habitat mapping, promoting advancements in autonomous seafloor classification and multi-sensor integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artic...</summary><p>Article under review by IJRR</p></details> |

However, how these approaches can complement each other within a unified framework remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we propose a multi-view learning framework that integrates contrastive principles into a generative pipeline to capture sound source and device information. Our method encodes compressed audio latents into view-specific and view-common subspaces, guided by two self-supervised objectives: contrastive learning for targeted information flow between subspaces, and reconstruction for overall information preservation. We evaluate our method on an urban sound sensor network dataset for sound source and sensor classification, demonstrating improved downstream performance over traditional SSL techniques. Additionally, we investigate the model's potential to disentangle environmental sound attributes within the structured latent space under varied training configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DCASE 2025 Workshop. 4+1 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks for ML code generation are mainly restricted to English, overlooking the global and multilingual nature of ML research and practice. To address this gap, we present ML2B, the first benchmark for evaluating multilingual ML code generation. ML2B consists of 30 Kaggle competitions translated into 13 natural languages, covering tabular, text, and image data types, with structured metadata and validated human-reviewed translations. For evaluation, we employ AIDE, an automated framework for end-to-end assessment of data science pipelines, and provide insights into cross-lingual model performance. Our results reveal substantial 15-45% performance degradation on non-English tasks, highlighting critical challenges in multilingual representation learning for code generation. The benchmark, evaluation framework, and comprehensive results are made available through our GitHub repository to facilitate future research in multilingual ML code generation: https://github.com/enaix/ml2b.</p></details> |  |

While previous research has addressed dataset limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings, they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction. Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction. Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets. We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection, ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform exact solutions.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[Compressed Concatenation of Small Embedding Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04626v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedding models are central to dense retrieval, semantic search, and recommendation systems, but their size often makes them impractical to deploy in resource-constrained environments such as browsers or edge devices. While smaller embedding models offer practical advantages, they typically underperform compared to their larger counterparts. To bridge this gap, we demonstrate that concatenating the raw embedding vectors of multiple small models can outperform a single larger baseline on standard retrieval benchmarks. To overcome the resulting high dimensionality of naive concatenation, we introduce a lightweight unified decoder trained with a Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) loss. This decoder maps the high-dimensional joint representation to a low-dimensional space, preserving most of the original performance without fine-tuning the base models. We also show that while concatenating more base models yields diminishing gains, the robustness of the decoder's representation under compression and quantization improves. Our experiments show that, on a subset of MTEB retrieval tasks, our concat-encode-quantize pipeline recovers 89\% of the original performance with a 48x compression factor when the pipeline is applied to a concatenation of four small embedding models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Representation Learning for Customized Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04564v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional representation learning methods learn a universal representation that primarily captures dominant semantics, which may not always align with customized downstream tasks. For instance, in animal habitat analysis, researchers prioritize scene-related features, whereas universal embeddings emphasize categorical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. As a solution, existing approaches resort to supervised fine-tuning, which however incurs high computational and annotation costs. In this paper, we propose Conditional Representation Learning (CRL), aiming to extract representations tailored to arbitrary user-specified criteria. Specifically, we reveal that the semantics of a space are determined by its basis, thereby enabling a set of descriptive words to approximate the basis for a customized feature space. Building upon this insight, given a user-specified criterion, CRL first employs a large language model (LLM) to generate descriptive texts to construct the semantic basis, then projects the image representation into this conditional feature space leveraging a vision-language model (VLM). The conditional representation better captures semantics for the specific criterion, which could be utilized for multiple customized tasks. Extensive experiments on classification and retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority and generality of the proposed CRL. The code is available at https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2025-NeurIPS-CRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Cross-modal Backward-compatible Representation Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14715v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern retrieval systems often struggle with upgrading to new and more powerful models due to the incompatibility of embeddings between the old and new models. This necessitates a costly process known as backfilling, which involves re-computing the embeddings for a large number of data samples. In vision, Backward-compatible Training (BT) has been proposed to ensure that the new model aligns with the old model's embeddings. This paper extends the concept of vision-only BT to the field of cross-modal retrieval, marking the first attempt to address Cross-modal BT (XBT). Our goal is to achieve backward-compatibility between Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) models, such as CLIP, for the cross-modal retrieval task. To address XBT challenges, we propose an efficient solution: a projection module that maps the new model's embeddings to those of the old model. This module, pretrained solely with text data, significantly reduces the number of image-text pairs required for XBT learning, and, once it is pretrained, it avoids using the old model during training. Furthermore, we utilize parameter-efficient training strategies that improve efficiency and preserve the off-the-shelf new model's knowledge by avoiding any modifications. Experimental results on cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of XBT and its potential to enable backfill-free upgrades when a new VLP model emerges.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRACE: Generative Representation Learning via Contrastive Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04506v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing methods for training Large Language Models (LLMs) as text encoders rely on contrastive losses that treat the model as a black box function, discarding its generative and reasoning capabilities in favor of static embeddings. We introduce GRACE (Generative Representation Learning via Contrastive Policy Optimization), a novel framework that reimagines contrastive signals not as losses to be minimized, but as rewards that guide a generative policy. In GRACE, the LLM acts as a policy that produces explicit, human-interpretable rationales--structured natural language explanations of its semantic understanding. These rationales are then encoded into high-quality embeddings via mean pooling. Using policy gradient optimization, we train the model with a multi-component reward function that maximizes similarity between query positive pairs and minimizes similarity with negatives. This transforms the LLM from an opaque encoder into an interpretable agent whose reasoning process is transparent and inspectable. On MTEB benchmark, GRACE yields broad cross category gains: averaged over four backbones, the supervised setting improves overall score by 11.5% over base models, and the unsupervised variant adds 6.9%, while preserving general capabilities. This work treats contrastive objectives as rewards over rationales, unifying representation learning with generation to produce stronger embeddings and transparent rationales.

However, distilling GNNs for self-supervised graph representation learning into MLPs is more challenging. This is because the performance of self-supervised learning is more related to the model's inductive bias than supervised learning. This motivates us to design a new distillation method to bridge a huge capacity gap between GNNs and MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{D}iffusion-\textbf{A}ssisted \textbf{D}istillation for \textbf{S}elf-supervised \textbf{G}raph representation learning with \textbf{M}LPs (DAD-SGM). The proposed method employs a denoising diffusion model as a teacher assistant to better distill the knowledge from the teacher GNN into the student MLP. This approach enhances the generalizability and robustness of MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAD-SGM effectively distills the knowledge of self-supervised GNNs compared to state-of-the-art GNN-to-MLP distillation methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/SeongJinAhn/DAD-SGM.</p></details> |  |

Token compression methods can reduce inference cost, but they require fixing a compression rate in advance and produce a single fixed-length output, offering no flexibility to balance information density and efficiency at inference time. Matryoshka representation learning (MRL) addresses this by enabling a single model to operate across multiple token granularities, allowing compression rates to be adjusted dynamically. However, current MRL-based methods treat each scale independently during training, limiting cross-scale generalization, robustness at high compression, and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoME (Mixture of Matryoshka Experts), a novel framework that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into MRL-based LLMs for AVSR. MoME augments a frozen LLM with top-k routed and shared experts, allowing dynamic capacity allocation across scales and modalities. A shared router promotes consistent expert activation across granularities, enabling compressed sequences to benefit from representations learned at lower compression. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 demonstrate that MoME achieves state-of-the-art performance across AVSR, ASR, and VSR tasks, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and maintaining robustness under noise. MoME unifies the adaptability of MRL with the efficiency of MoE, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for resource-aware speech recognition.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Previous methods typically learn transferable interaction patterns between structures of drug and proteins to tackle it. However, insight from proteomics suggest that protein have multi-level structures and they all influence the DTI. Existing works usually represent protein with only primary structures, limiting their ability to capture interactions involving higher-level structures. Inspired by this insight, we propose ColdDTI, a framework attending on protein multi-level structure for cold-start DTI prediction. We employ hierarchical attention mechanism to mine interaction between multi-level protein structures (from primary to quaternary) and drug structures at both local and global granularities. Then, we leverage mined interactions to fuse structure representations of different levels for final prediction. Our design captures biologically transferable priors, avoiding the risk of overfitting caused by excessive reliance on representation learning. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ColdDTI consistently outperforms previous methods in cold-start settings.</p></details> |  |

In real-world scenarios, beyond pure text, a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in tables, and user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. Retrieving knowledge from a table corpora (i.e., various individual tables) for a question remains nascent, at least, for (i) how to understand intra- and inter-table knowledge effectively, (ii) how to filter unnecessary tables and how to retrieve the most relevant tables efficiently, (iii) how to prompt LLMs to infer over the retrieval, (iv) how to evaluate the corresponding performance in a realistic setting. Facing the above challenges, in this paper, we first propose a table-corpora-aware RAG framework, named T-RAG, which consists of the hierarchical memory index, multi-stage retrieval, and graph-aware prompting for effective and efficient table knowledge retrieval and inference. Further, we first develop a multi-table question answering benchmark named MultiTableQA, which spans 3 different task types, 57,193 tables, and 23,758 questions in total, and the sources are all from real-world scenarios. Based on MultiTableQA, we did the holistic comparison over table retrieval methods, RAG methods, and table-to-graph representation learning methods, where T-RAG shows the leading accuracy, recall, and running time performance.

However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations, severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over 904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24 synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets, advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.</p></details> |  |

Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN. We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms: (i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas. Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Mask What Matters: Controllable Text-Guided Masking for Self-Supervised Medical Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23054v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution, existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas. This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1 percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision (BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios (e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking, a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance synergistic information through an Infinite Masking strategy. InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[From Moments to Models: Graphon Mixture-Aware Mixup and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03690v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graph datasets often consist of mixtures of populations, where graphs are generated from multiple distinct underlying distributions. However, modern representation learning approaches, such as graph contrastive learning (GCL) and augmentation methods like Mixup, typically overlook this mixture structure. In this work, we propose a unified framework that explicitly models data as a mixture of underlying probabilistic graph generative models represented by graphons. To characterize these graphons, we leverage graph moments (motif densities) to cluster graphs arising from the same model. This enables us to disentangle the mixture components and identify their distinct generative mechanisms. This model-aware partitioning benefits two key graph learning tasks: 1) It enables a graphon-mixture-aware mixup (GMAM), a data augmentation technique that interpolates in a semantically valid space guided by the estimated graphons, instead of assuming a single graphon per class. 2) For GCL, it enables model-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally, by introducing a new model-aware objective, our proposed approach (termed MGCL) improves negative sampling by restricting negatives to graphs from other models. We establish a key theoretical guarantee: a novel, tighter bound showing that graphs sampled from graphons with small cut distance will have similar motif densities with high probability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong empirical performance. In unsupervised learning, MGCL achieves state-of-the-art results, obtaining the top average rank across eight datasets. In supervised learning, GMAM consistently outperforms existing strategies, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in 6 out of 7 datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Generation Powered with LLMs for Boosting Multivariate Time-Series Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03645v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sourced from multiple sensors and organized chronologically, Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) data involves crucial spatial-temporal dependencies. To capture these dependencies, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools. As explicit graphs are not inherent to MTS data, graph generation becomes a critical first step in adapting GNNs to this domain. However, existing approaches often rely solely on the data itself for MTS graph generation, leaving them vulnerable to biases from small training datasets. This limitation hampers their ability to construct effective graphs, undermining the accurate modeling of underlying dependencies in MTS data and reducing GNN performance in this field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, K-Link, leveraging the extensive universal knowledge encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce biases for powered MTS graph generation. To harness the knowledge within LLMs, such as physical principles, we design and extract a \textit{Knowledge-Link graph} that captures universal knowledge of sensors and their linkage. To empower MTS graph generation with the knowledge-link graph, we further introduce a graph alignment module that transfers universal knowledge from the knowledge-link graph to the graph generated from MTS data. This enhances the MTS graph quality, ensuring effective representation learning for MTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of K-Link for superior performance on various MTS tasks.</p></details> |  |

While supervised visual bug detection models offer a promising solution, their reliance on extensive labeled datasets presents a significant challenge due to the infrequent occurrence of such bugs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a hybrid Co-FineTuning (CFT) method that effectively integrates both labeled and unlabeled data. Our approach leverages labeled samples from the target game and diverse co-domain games, additionally incorporating unlabeled data to enhance feature representation learning. This strategy maximizes the utility of all available data, substantially reducing the dependency on labeled examples from the specific target game. The developed framework demonstrates enhanced scalability and adaptability, facilitating efficient visual bug detection across various game titles. Our experimental results show the robustness of the proposed method for game visual bug detection, exhibiting superior performance compared to conventional baselines across multiple gaming environments. Furthermore, CFT maintains competitive performance even when trained with only 50% of the labeled data from the target game.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 21st AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment (AIIDE 2025)</p></details> |

In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA) and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning, we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains, representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings. We further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning representations for formal languages.</p></details> |  |

Yet most existing multimodal approaches rely on a small set of highly variable genes, which limits predictive scope and overlooks the coordinated biological programs that shape tissue phenotypes. We present PEaRL (Pathway Enhanced Representation Learning), a multimodal framework that represents transcriptomics through pathway activation scores computed with ssGSEA. By encoding biologically coherent pathway signals with a transformer and aligning them with histology features via contrastive learning, PEaRL reduces dimensionality, improves interpretability, and strengthens cross-modal correspondence. Across three cancer ST datasets (breast, skin, and lymph node), PEaRL consistently outperforms SOTA methods, yielding higher accuracy for both gene- and pathway-level expression prediction (up to 58.9 percent and 20.4 percent increase in Pearson correlation coefficient compared to SOTA). These results demonstrate that grounding transcriptomic representation in pathways produces more biologically faithful and interpretable multimodal models, advancing computational pathology beyond gene-level embeddings.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges.

In this work, we introduce CVSM (Contrastive Vocal Similarity Modeling), a contrastive self-supervised procedure for music signal representation learning in the audio domain that can be utilized for musical and vocal similarity modeling. Our method operates under a contrastive framework, maximizing the similarity between vocal excerpts and musical mixtures containing the same vocals; we devise both a label-informed protocol, leveraging artist identity information to sample the contrastive pairs, and a label-agnostic scheme, involving artificial mixture creation from randomly sampled vocal and accompaniment excerpts, which are paired with vocals from the same audio segment. We evaluate our proposed method in measuring vocal similarity both objectively, through linear probing on a suite of appropriate downstream tasks, and subjectively, via conducting a user study consisting of pairwise comparisons between different models in a recommendation-by-query setting. Our results indicate that the representations learned through CVSM are effective in musical and vocal similarity modeling, outperforming numerous baselines across both isolated vocals and complete musical mixtures. Moreover, while the availability of artist identity labels during pre-training leads to overall more consistent performance both in the evaluated downstream tasks and the user study, a label-agnostic CVSM variant incorporating hybrid pre-training with real and artificial mixtures achieves comparable performance to the label-informed one in artist identification and perceived vocal similarity.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 tables, 8 figures.

Large vision foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77 on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, ICOMP 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing works model spatial and temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The o...</summary><p>The original paper has issues and has been restructured in the work; it is no longer suitable, so I am applying for withdrawal</p></details> |

Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city road networks. This dataset features graphs with over 100k nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs based on local node eccentricities, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement-particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution-which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.</p></details> | work in progress |

By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS, MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton, Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements.

While recent two-stage approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized Representation Learning that integrates both affordance-guided reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns language with image content at both global and regional levels. These contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. The source code is available at https://github.com/lzzhhh1019/CRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid-Collaborative Augmentation and Contrastive Sample Adaptive-Differential Awareness for Robust Attributed Graph Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02731v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness (CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.</p></details> |  |

Recently, various multimodal entity linking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive embeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of high-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in metric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this possibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of MEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a generative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for generating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the responsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved in generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy gradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial network for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns meaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning. Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.</p></details> | Submitted to TPAMI |

While classical methods like Waveform Similarity-based Overlap-Add (WSOLA) provide strong baselines, they often introduce artifacts under non-stationary or extreme stretching conditions. We propose STSM-FILM - a fully neural architecture that incorporates Feature-Wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to condition the model on a continuous speed factor. By supervising the network using WSOLA-generated outputs, STSM-FILM learns to mimic alignment and synthesis behaviors while benefiting from representations learned through deep learning. We explore four encoder-decoder variants: STFT-HiFiGAN, WavLM-HiFiGAN, Whisper-HiFiGAN, and EnCodec, and demonstrate that STSM-FILM is capable of producing perceptually consistent outputs across a wide range of time-scaling factors. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of FiLM-based conditioning to improve the generalization and flexibility of neural TSM models.</p></details> |  |

Building effective representation for team coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Web: ...</summary><p>Web: https://dongsuleetech.github.io/projects/IWoL/</p></details> |

However, such claims are typically drawn from narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation, pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers -- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models.</p></details> | ICASSP 2025 |

Considering the social impact of AI systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data.

However, current deep learning models use new principles for unsupervised representation learning that cannot be easily analyzed using classical theories. For example, visual foundation models have found tremendous success using self-supervision or denoising/masked autoencoders, which effectively learn representations from massive amounts of unlabeled data. However, it remains difficult to characterize the representations learned by these models and to explain why they perform well for diverse prediction tasks or show emergent behavior.

Spatial structure is fundamental to effective geospatial intelligence systems; however, existing foundation models often lack the flexibility to reason about places, context-rich regions spanning multiple spatial granularities that may consist of many spatially and semantically related points of interest. To address this gap, we propose PlaceFM, a geospatial foundation model that captures place representations through a training-free, clustering-based approach. PlaceFM summarizes the entire point of interest graph constructed from U.S. Foursquare data, producing general-purpose region embeddings while automatically identifying places of interest. These embeddings can be directly integrated into geolocation data pipelines to support a variety of urban downstream tasks. Without the need for costly pre-training, PlaceFM provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-granular geospatial analysis. Extensive experiments on two real-world prediction tasks, ZIP code-level population density and housing prices, demonstrate that PlaceFM not only outperforms most state-of-the-art graph-based geospatial foundation models but also achieves up to a 100x speedup in generating region-level representations on large-scale POI graphs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/mohammadhashemii/PlaceFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[MambAttention: Mamba with Multi-Head Attention for Generalizable Single-Channel Speech Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00966v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies have shown that these models match or outperform state-of-the-art models in single-channel speech enhancement, automatic speech recognition, and self-supervised audio representation learning. However, prior research has demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the training set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended (VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our proposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020 and EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset VB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. However, our MambAttention model remains superior on both out-of-domain datasets across all reported evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[GARLIC: GAussian Representation LearnIng for spaCe partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24608v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present \textbf{GARLIC}, a representation learning approach for Euclidean approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in high dimensions. Existing partitions tend to rely on isotropic cells, fixed global resolution, or balanced constraints, which fragment dense regions and merge unrelated points in sparse ones, thereby increasing the candidate count when probing only a few cells. Our method instead partitions \(\mathbb{R}^d\) into anisotropic Gaussian cells whose shapes align with local geometry and sizes adapt to data density. Information-theoretic objectives balance coverage, overlap, and geometric alignment, while split/clone refinement introduces Gaussians only where needed. At query time, Mahalanobis distance selects relevant cells and localized quantization prunes candidates. This yields partitions that reduce cross-cell neighbor splits and candidate counts under small probe budgets, while remaining robust even when trained on only a small fraction of the dataset. Overall, GARLIC introduces a geometry-aware space-partitioning paradigm that combines information-theoretic objectives with adaptive density refinement, offering competitive recall--efficiency trade-offs for Euclidean ANN search.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Representation Regularization for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01711v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning, while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen, through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |

In this work, we introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from 3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives. We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing applications.</p></details> |  |

However, capturing the heterophily patterns and the multi-dimensional nature of user-item interactions poses significant challenges. To address this, we introduce FWHDNN (Fusion-based Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Networks), an innovative framework aimed at advancing representation learning in hypergraph-based recommendation tasks. The model incorporates three key components: (1) a cross-difference relation encoder leveraging heterophily-aware hypergraph diffusion to adapt message-passing for diverse class labels, (2) a multi-level cluster-wise encoder employing wavelet transform-based hypergraph neural network layers to capture multi-scale topological relationships, and (3) an integrated multi-modal fusion mechanism that combines structural and textual information through intermediate and late-fusion strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FWHDNN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and scalability in capturing high-order interconnections between users and items.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed and extended results</p></details> |

We introduce BioBlobs, a plug-and-play, fully differentiable module that represents proteins by dynamically partitioning structures into flexibly-sized, non-overlapping substructures ("blobs"). The resulting blobs are quantized into a shared and interpretable codebook, yielding a discrete vocabulary of function-relevant protein substructures used to compute protein embeddings. We show that BioBlobs representations improve the performance of widely used protein encoders such as GVP-GNN across various PRL tasks. Our approach highlights the value of architectures that directly capture function-relevant protein substructures, enabling both improved predictive performance and mechanistic insight into protein function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Representation Learning as Mutual Information Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01345v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network, stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound, we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization, making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Act to See, See to Act: Diffusion-Driven Perception-Action Interplay for Adaptive Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25822v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing imitation learning methods decouple perception and action, which overlooks the causal reciprocity between sensory representations and action execution that humans naturally leverage for adaptive behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce Action-Guided Diffusion Policy (DP-AG), a unified representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP-AG encodes latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning between perception and action, we introduce a cycle-consistent contrastive loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent perception-action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP-AG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across simulation benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP-AG offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial policy learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Stackelberg Coupling of Online Representation Learning and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07452v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Q-learning jointly learns representations and values within monolithic networks, promising beneficial co-adaptation between features and value estimates. Although this architecture has attained substantial success, the coupling between representation and value learning creates instability as representations must constantly adapt to non-stationary value targets, while value estimates depend on these shifting representations. This is compounded by high variance in bootstrapped targets, which causes bias in value estimation in off-policy methods. We introduce Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER), a framework for value-based RL that views representation and Q-learning as two strategic agents in a hierarchical game. SCORER models the Q-function as the leader, which commits to its strategy by updating less frequently, while the perception network (encoder) acts as the follower, adapting more frequently to learn representations that minimize Bellman error variance given the leader's committed strategy. Through this division of labor, the Q-function minimizes MSBE while perception minimizes its variance, thereby reducing bias accordingly, with asymmetric updates allowing stable co-adaptation, unlike simultaneous parameter updates in monolithic solutions. Our proposed SCORER framework leads to a bi-level optimization problem whose solution is approximated by a two-timescale algorithm that creates an asymmetric learning dynamic between the two players. Extensive experiments on DQN and its variants demonstrate that gains stem from algorithmic insight rather than model complexity.</p></details> |  |

We fine-tune BERT for Patents with examiner-added citation information to generate numerical representations for patent documents. PaECTER performs better in similarity tasks than current state-of-the-art models used in the patent domain. More specifically, our model outperforms the patent specific pre-trained language model (BERT for Patents) and general-purpose text embedding models (e.g., E5, GTE, and BGE) on our patent citation prediction test dataset on different rank evaluation metrics. PaECTER predicts at least one most similar patent at a rank of 1.32 on average when compared against 25 irrelevant patents. Numerical representations generated by PaECTER from patent text can be used for downstream tasks such as classification, tracing knowledge flows, or semantic similarity search.

To further improve the clustering of Arabic text data in aggregated search environments, this research investigates the application of advanced natural language processing techniques, namely stacked autoencoders and AraBERT embeddings. By transcending the limitations of traditional search engines, which are imprecise, not contextually relevant, and not personalized, we offer more enriched, context-aware characterizations of search results, so we used a K-means clustering algorithm to discover distinctive features and relationships in these results, we then used our approach on different Arabic queries to evaluate its effectiveness. Our model illustrates that using stacked autoencoders in representation learning suits clustering tasks and can significantly improve clustering search results. It also demonstrates improved accuracy and relevance of search results.</p></details> |  |

A fundamental issue is that both the graph structure and the nodes own their own dynamics, and their blending induces intractable complexity in the temporal evolution over graphs. Drawing inspiration from the recent progress of physical dynamic models in deep neural networks, we propose Graph Neural Controlled Differential Equations (GN-CDEs), a continuous-time framework that jointly models node embeddings and structural dynamics by incorporating a graph enhanced neural network vector field with a time-varying graph path as the control signal. Our framework exhibits several desirable characteristics, including the ability to express dynamics on evolving graphs without piecewise integration, the capability to calibrate trajectories with subsequent data, and robustness to missing observations. Empirical evaluation on a range of dynamic graph representation learning tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approach in capturing the complex dynamics of dynamic graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI 2025</p></details> |

We formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits (FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose OpenAI embedding model.</p></details> |  |

Yet, standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.</p></details> |  |

Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily sampled discrete observations of functions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn entity-level information within images to complement their global representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.</p></details> | 25 pages |

As fairness becomes crucial in machine learning, fair CCA has gained attention. However, previous approaches often overlook the impact on downstream classification tasks, limiting applicability. We propose a novel fair CCA method for fair representation learning, ensuring the projected features are independent of sensitive attributes, thus enhancing fairness without compromising accuracy. We validate our method on synthetic data and real-world data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), demonstrating its ability to maintain high correlation analysis performance while improving fairness in classification tasks. Our work enables fair machine learning in neuroimaging studies where unbiased analysis is essential. Code is available in https://github.com/ZhanliangAaronWang/FR-CCA-ADNI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cutting the Skip: Training Residual-Free Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00345v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture. We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting, leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection (CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery (CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain (SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS'25. 22 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

A key challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories. Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2) Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results, particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%.

Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations. These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series modeling.

While classical approaches rely on global distances in Euclidean space, they often fall short in capturing intrinsic data geometry. Enter Riemannian metric learning: a powerful generalization that leverages differential geometry to model the data according to their underlying Riemannian manifold. This approach has demonstrated remarkable success across diverse domains, from causal inference and optimal transport to generative modeling and representation learning. In this review, we bridge the gap between classical metric learning and Riemannian geometry, providing a structured and accessible overview of key methods, applications, and recent advances. We argue that Riemannian metric learning is not merely a technical refinement but a fundamental shift in how we think about data representations. Thus, this review should serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring Riemannian metric learning and convince them that it is closer to them than they might imagine-both in theory and in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Fairness-Performance Pareto Front Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17643v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a well known intrinsic trade-off between the fairness of a representation and the performance of classifiers derived from the representation. Due to the complexity of optimisation algorithms in most modern representation learning approaches, for a given method it may be non-trivial to decide whether the obtained fairness-performance curve of the method is optimal, i.e., whether it is close to the true Pareto front for these quantities for the underlying data distribution. In this paper we propose a new method to compute the optimal Pareto front, which does not require the training of complex representation models. We show that optimal fair representations possess several useful structural properties, and that these properties enable a reduction of the computation of the Pareto Front to a compact discrete problem. We then also show that these compact approximating problems can be efficiently solved via off-the shelf concave-convex programming methods. Since our approach is independent of the specific model of representations, it may be used as the benchmark to which representation learning algorithms may be compared. We experimentally evaluate the approach on a number of real world benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, contain link to package.

In this paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We introduce several key innovations: (i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for detailed semantic representation, (ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning strategy to align multimodal features, (iii) superpoint temporal consistency to maintain stable representations across time, and (iv) multi-source data pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art methods in linear probing and fine-tuning for LiDAR-based segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments on 11 large-scale multi-sensor datasets highlight our superior performance, demonstrating adaptability, efficiency, and robustness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TPAMI 2025; 17 pages, 9 figures, 11 tables; Project Page at https://ldkong.com/LargeAD</p></details> |

First, we make the observation that during training of video masked-autoencoding (MAE) models, ViT layers converge in the order of their depth: shallower layers converge early, deeper layers converge late. We then show that this observation can be exploited to accelerate standard MAE by progressively freezing the model according to an explicit schedule, throughout training. Furthermore, this same schedule can be used in a simple and scalable approach to latent prediction that does not suffer from "representation collapse". We apply our proposed approach, LayerLock, to large models of up to 4B parameters with results surpassing those of non-latent masked prediction on the 4DS perception suite.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Yet, their scalability has long been limited by prohibitive time and memory costs. While progress has been made in scaling kernel regression, no framework exists for scalable kernel-based representation learning, restricting their use in the era of foundation models where representations are learned from massive unlabeled data. We introduce KREPES -- a unified, scalable framework for kernel-based representation learning via Nystr\"om approximation. KREPES accommodates a wide range of unsupervised and self-supervised losses, and experiments on large image and tabular datasets demonstrate its efficiency. Crucially, KREPES enables principled interpretability of the learned representations, an immediate benefit over deep models, which we substantiate through dedicated analysis.</p></details> | 19 Pages, 3 figures |

Most existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

While prior works have adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks, scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U2QT (Unified User Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a two-stage architecture: first, we use the Qwen3 Embedding model to derive a compact yet expressive feature representation; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase U2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports industrial-scale applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the intrinsic heterogeneity of diverse modalities presents substantial challenges to achieve effective cross-modal collaboration and integration. To address this, we introduce DecAlign, a novel hierarchical cross-modal alignment framework designed to decouple multimodal representations into modality-unique (heterogeneous) and modality-common (homogeneous) features. For handling heterogeneity, we employ a prototype-guided optimal transport alignment strategy leveraging gaussian mixture modeling and multi-marginal transport plans, thus mitigating distribution discrepancies while preserving modality-unique characteristics. To reinforce homogeneity, we ensure semantic consistency across modalities by aligning latent distribution matching with Maximum Mean Discrepancy regularization. Furthermore, we incorporate a multimodal transformer to enhance high-level semantic feature fusion, thereby further reducing cross-modal inconsistencies. Our extensive experiments on four widely used multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that DecAlign consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across five metrics. These results highlight the efficacy of DecAlign in enhancing superior cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency while preserving modality-unique features, marking a significant advancement in multimodal representation learning scenarios.

However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on Joint Embedding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Workshop on Time Series in the Age of Large Models - NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Unsupervised Representation Learning for 3D Mesh Parameterization with Semantic and Visibility Objectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25094v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent 3D generative models produce high-quality textures for 3D mesh objects. However, they commonly rely on the heavy assumption that input 3D meshes are accompanied by manual mesh parameterization (UV mapping), a manual task that requires both technical precision and artistic judgment. Industry surveys show that this process often accounts for a significant share of asset creation, creating a major bottleneck for 3D content creators. Moreover, existing automatic methods often ignore two perceptually important criteria: (1) semantic awareness (UV charts should align semantically similar 3D parts across shapes) and (2) visibility awareness (cutting seams should lie in regions unlikely to be seen). To overcome these shortcomings and to automate the mesh parameterization process, we present an unsupervised differentiable framework that augments standard geometry-preserving UV learning with semantic- and visibility-aware objectives. For semantic-awareness, our pipeline (i) segments the mesh into semantic 3D parts, (ii) applies an unsupervised learned per-part UV-parameterization backbone, and (iii) aggregates per-part charts into a unified UV atlas. For visibility-awareness, we use ambient occlusion (AO) as an exposure proxy and back-propagate a soft differentiable AO-weighted seam objective to steer cutting seams toward occluded regions. By conducting qualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we show that the proposed method produces UV atlases that better support texture generation and reduce perceptible seam artifacts compared to recent baselines. Our implementation code is publicly available at: https://github.com/AHHHZ975/Semantic-Visibility-UV-Param.</p></details> |  |
| **[Event-based Facial Keypoint Alignment via Cross-Modal Fusion Attention and Self-Supervised Multi-Event Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24968v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning Distinguishable Representations in Deep Q-Networks for Linear Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24947v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex sequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL framework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs. Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage the internal representations learned by the neural network during training. Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby reducing computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, current unsupervised SNNs predominantly employ shallow architectures or localized plasticity rules, limiting their ability to model long-range temporal dependencies and maintain temporal feature consistency. This results in semantically unstable representations, thereby impeding the development of deep unsupervised SNNs for large-scale temporal video data. We propose PredNext, which explicitly models temporal relationships through cross-view future Step Prediction and Clip Prediction. This plug-and-play module seamlessly integrates with diverse self-supervised objectives. We firstly establish standard benchmarks for SNN self-supervised learning on UCF101, HMDB51, and MiniKinetics, which are substantially larger than conventional DVS datasets. PredNext delivers significant performance improvements across different tasks and self-supervised methods. PredNext achieves performance comparable to ImageNet-pretrained supervised weights through unsupervised training solely on UCF101. Additional experiments demonstrate that PredNext, distinct from forced consistency constraints, substantially improves temporal feature consistency while enhancing network generalization capabilities. This work provides a effective foundation for unsupervised deep SNNs on large-scale temporal video data.</p></details> |  |

However, the representations learned by these models are unclear, and their analysis mainly restricts to linear probing of the hidden representations. In this work, we explore the use of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze the hidden representations of pretrained models, focusing on a case study in singing technique classification. We first demonstrate that SAEs retain both information about the original representations and class labels, enabling their internal structure to provide insights into self-supervised learning systems. Furthermore, we show that SAEs enhance the disentanglement of vocal attributes, establishing them as an effective tool for identifying the underlying factors encoded in the representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Unlike conventional discriminative features that directly optimize posterior and thus emphasize semantic abstraction while losing fine grained details, audio generation models inherently encode both spatiotemporal perception (capturing local acoustic texture across time and frequency) and semantic prior (knowing what to generate). It motivates us to explore the bridge of these complementary strengths. We provide a systematic investigation of their differences and complementary relationships, and ultimately propose an effective fusion strategy. Experiments across multiple tasks, including sound event classification, tagging, and particularly the fine grained task of audio captioning, demonstrate consistent performance gains. Beyond empirical improvements, this work more importantly introduces a new perspective on audio representation learning, highlighting that generative discriminative complementarity can provide both detailed perception and semantic awareness for audio understanding.</p></details> |  |

This limitation arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight, adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Joint Conference on Knowledge Graphs</p></details> |

This challenge is particularly pronounced when jointly training a single encoder for Information Retrieval (IR) and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), two essential but fundamentally disparate tasks for which naive co-training typically yields steep performance trade-offs. We argue that resolving this conflict requires systematically decoupling task-specific learning signals throughout the training pipeline. To this end, we introduce CoDiEmb, a unified framework that reconciles the divergent requirements of IR and STS in a collaborative yet distinct manner. CoDiEmb integrates three key innovations for effective joint optimization: (1) Task-specialized objectives paired with a dynamic sampler that forms single-task batches and balances per-task updates, thereby preventing gradient interference. For IR, we employ a contrastive loss with multiple positives and hard negatives, augmented by cross-device sampling. For STS, we adopt order-aware objectives that directly optimize correlation and ranking consistency. (2) A delta-guided model fusion strategy that computes fine-grained merging weights for checkpoints by analyzing each parameter's deviation from its pre-trained initialization, proving more effective than traditional Model Soups. (3) An efficient, single-stage training pipeline that is simple to implement and converges stably. Extensive experiments on 15 standard IR and STS benchmarks across three base encoders validate CoDiEmb. Our results and analysis demonstrate that the framework not only mitigates cross-task trade-offs but also measurably improves the geometric properties of the embedding space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Category Discovery: An Open-World Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22542v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery, skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object scenarios. Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of the category discovery literature at https://github.com/Visual-AI/Category-Discovery.</p></details> |  |

However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision, supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and (iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS, demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis. Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech tokenization and downstream tasks.

However, existing methods, whether based on handcrafted feature engineering or standard deep learning, face two major challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale EEG-AD datasets for robust representation learning, and 2) the absence of a dedicated deep learning pipeline for subject-level detection, which is more clinically meaningful than the commonly used sample-level detection. To address these gaps, we have curated the world's largest EEG-AD corpus to date, comprising 2,255 subjects. Leveraging this unique data corpus, we propose LEAD, the first large-scale foundation model for EEG analysis in dementia. Our approach provides an innovative framework for subject-level AD detection, including: 1) a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline such as artifact removal, resampling, and filtering, and a newly proposed multi-scale segmentation strategy, 2) a subject-regularized spatio-temporal transformer trained with a novel subject-level cross-entropy loss and an indices group-shuffling algorithm, and 3) AD-guided contrastive pre-training. We pre-train on 12 datasets (3 AD-related and 9 non-AD) and fine-tune/test on 4 AD datasets. Compared with 10 baselines, LEAD consistently obtains superior subject-level detection performance under the challenging subject-independent cross-validation protocol. On the benchmark ADFTD dataset, our model achieves an impressive subject-level Sensitivity of 90.91% under the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) setting. These results strongly validate the effectiveness of our method for real-world EEG-based AD detection. Source code: https://github.com/DL4mHealth/LEAD</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the on-demand worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation, allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic, immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Compression via Multimodal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24431v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal representation learning produces high-dimensional embeddings that align diverse modalities in a shared latent space. While this enables strong generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore, their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScatterAD: Temporal-Topological Scattering Mechanism for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24414v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However, traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series anomaly detection.

Such variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences, but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT, our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric (EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains, while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step orderings and filter out noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

While EMA prevents representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT (Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student), increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically, our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video representation learning.</p></details> | Technical Report |

However, different methods tend to extract distinct aspects of the data, and relying on a single approach may overlook important insights relevant to downstream tasks. This paper proposes a performance-enhanced aggregated representation learning method, which combines multiple representation learning approaches to improve the performance of downstream tasks. The framework is designed to be general and flexible, accommodating a wide range of loss functions commonly used in machine learning models. To ensure computational efficiency, we use surrogate loss functions to facilitate practical weight estimation. Theoretically, we prove that our method asymptotically achieves optimal performance in downstream tasks, meaning that the risk of our predictor is asymptotically equivalent to the theoretical minimum. Additionally, we derive that our method asymptotically assigns nonzero weights to correctly specified models. We evaluate our method on diverse tasks by comparing it with advanced machine learning models. The experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods, showing its effectiveness and broad applicability in real-world machine learning scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |

To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects, recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data. Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets, providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://czvvd.github.io/PartSAMPage/</p></details> |
| **[ELASTIQ: EEG-Language Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24302v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction (STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on 20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces. The code and pre-trained weights will be released.</p></details> |  |

However, their focus on pairwise relationships restricts their ability to learn pervasive higher-order interactions in real-world systems, which can be naturally modeled as hypergraphs. To tackle this issue, Hypergraph Neural Networks (HNNs) have garnered substantial attention in recent years. Despite the proposal of numerous HNNs, the absence of consistent experimental protocols and multi-dimensional empirical analysis impedes deeper understanding and further development of HNN research. While several toolkits for deep hypergraph learning (DHGL) have been introduced to facilitate algorithm evaluation, they provide only limited quantitative evaluation results and insufficient coverage of advanced algorithms, datasets, and benchmark tasks. To fill the gap, we introduce DHG-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for HNNs. Specifically, DHG-Bench systematically investigates the characteristics of HNNs in terms of four dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and fairness. We comprehensively evaluate 17 state-of-the-art HNN algorithms on 22 diverse datasets spanning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks, under unified experimental settings. Extensive experiments reveal both the strengths and limitations of existing algorithms, offering valuable insights and directions for future research. Furthermore, to facilitate reproducible research, we have developed an easy-to-use library for training and evaluating different HNN methods. The DHG-Bench library is available at: https://github.com/Coco-Hut/DHG-Bench.</p></details> | 25 pages, 10 figures |

We introduce GIRCSE (Generative Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an emergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference steadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative refinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differential Encoding for Improved Representation Learning over Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02758v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining the message-passing paradigm with the global attention mechanism has emerged as an effective framework for learning over graphs. The message-passing paradigm and the global attention mechanism fundamentally generate node embeddings based on information aggregated from a node's local neighborhood or from the whole graph. The most basic and commonly used aggregation approach is to take the sum of information from a node's local neighbourhood or from the whole graph. However, it is unknown if the dominant information is from a node itself or from the node's neighbours (or the rest of the graph nodes). Therefore, there exists information lost at each layer of embedding generation, and this information lost could be accumulated and become more serious when more layers are used in the model. In this paper, we present a differential encoding method to address the issue of information lost. The idea of our method is to encode the differential representation between the information from a node's neighbours (or the rest of the graph nodes) and that from the node itself. The obtained differential encoding is then combined with the original aggregated local or global representation to generate the updated node embedding. By integrating differential encodings, the representational ability of generated node embeddings is improved. The differential encoding method is empirically evaluated on different graph tasks on seven benchmark datasets. The results show that it is a general method that improves the message-passing update and the global attention update, advancing the state-of-the-art performance for graph representation learning on these datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Big Data in September 2025</p></details> |
| **[Uni-NTFM: A Unified Foundation Model for EEG Signal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24222v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on various and unlabeled data have demonstrated significant success in natural language and vision, but their application to electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenged due to the signal's unique properties. Existing brain foundation models that inherit architectures designed for text or images lead to three limitations in pre-training: 1) conflating time-domain waveform patterns with frequency-domain rhythmic features in a single processing stream, 2) ignoring the critical spatial topology of electrodes with different standards, and 3) reliance on the inflexible, dense network to process functionally distinct EEG patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce the Unified Neural Topological Foundation Model (Uni-NTFM), which is designed based on neuroscience principles to produce universal and interpretable representations. Uni-NTFM integrates three core innovations: 1) a decoupled architecture parallelly encodes time, frequency, and raw signal representations before performing cross-domain feature integration; 2) a topological embedding mechanism to unify electrodes from different international standards and generate structured input sequences for brain regions; and 3) a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer that efficiently scales model capacity by routing signal patterns to specialized subnetworks. The largest model, Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, has a record-breaking 1.9B parameters and was pretrained on over 28,000 hours of diverse EEG data via a dual-domain masked reconstruction objective. Uni-NTFM significantly outperforms existing task-specific methods and foundation models across nine distinct downstream tasks under both linear probing and fine-tuning settings, demonstrating a superior ability to learn universal representations of brain activity.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a series of versatile and compact embedding models, systematically incentivizing advanced embedding capability in LLMs by superior training techniques and high-quality data. For model architecture, we implement the models on a 0.5B compact size with simple mean-pooling to produce fixed-length embeddings and remove the causal attention mask to enable fully bidirectional representation learning. For training techniques, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline: pre-training on weakly supervised large-scale datasets, fine-tuning with supervised high-quality datasets, and contrastive distillation with fine-grained soft signals, integrated with focal-style reweighting and online hard-negative mixing to emphasize difficult samples and enrich hard negatives, respectively. For training data, we curate over 20 categories for pre-training and 100 categories for fine-tuning and contrastive distillation, to improve both performance and generalization, leveraging task-specific instructions, hard-negative mining, and example-based multi-class labeling to ensure high quality. Combining these techniques, our KaLM-Embedding-V2 series achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark, outperforming models of comparable size and rivaling models 3-26x larger, setting a new standard for versatile and compact embedding models under 1B parameters. The code, data, and models will be publicly available to facilitate academic research.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 16 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

| **[Towards Quantifying Long-Range Interactions in Graph Machine Learning: a Large Graph Dataset and a Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09008v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-range dependencies are critical for effective graph representation learning, yet most existing datasets focus on small graphs tailored to inductive tasks, offering limited insight into long-range interactions. Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city road networks. This dataset features graphs with over 100k nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs based on local node eccentricities, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement-particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution-which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Inferring Pluggable Types with Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15676v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pluggable type systems allow programmers to extend the type system of a programming language to enforce semantic properties defined by the programmer. Pluggable type systems are difficult to deploy in legacy codebases because they require programmers to write type annotations manually. This paper investigates how to use machine learning to infer type qualifiers automatically. We propose a novel representation, NaP-AST, that encodes minimal dataflow hints for the effective inference of type qualifiers. We evaluate several model architectures for inferring type qualifiers, including Graph Transformer Network, Graph Convolutional Network and Large Language Model. We further validated these models by applying them to 12 open-source programs from a prior evaluation of the NullAway pluggable typechecker, lowering warnings in all but one unannotated project. We discovered that GTN shows the best performance, with a recall of .89 and precision of 0.6. Furthermore, we conduct a study to estimate the number of Java classes needed for good performance of the trained model. For our feasibility study, performance improved around 16k classes, and deteriorated due to overfitting around 22k classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Representation of Stiffened Panels with Non-Uniform Boundary Conditions and Loads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02472v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surrogate models are essential in structural analysis and optimization. We propose a heterogeneous graph representation of stiffened panels that accounts for geometrical variability, non-uniform boundary conditions, and diverse loading scenarios, using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The structure is partitioned into multiple structural units, such as stiffeners and the plates between them, with each unit represented by three distinct node types: geometry, boundary, and loading nodes. Edge heterogeneity is introduced by incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting nodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees of heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are implemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises stress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and degrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams composed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The heterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart, demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, an ablation analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of graph heterogeneity on HGT performance. The results show strong predictive accuracy for both displacement and von Mises stress, effectively capturing structural behavior patterns and maximum values.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint and has been submitted to Engineering with Computers</p></details> |
| **[Detecting LLM-Generated Spam Reviews by Integrating Language Model Embeddings and Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01801v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets, a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FraudSquad-5389/.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the first attempt to estimate 3D human body mesh from sparse LiDAR point clouds. We found that the major challenge in estimating human pose and mesh from point clouds lies in the sparsity, noise, and incompletion of LiDAR point clouds. Facing these challenges, we propose an effective sparse-to-dense reconstruction scheme to reconstruct 3D human mesh. This involves estimating a sparse representation of a human (3D human pose) and gradually reconstructing the body mesh. To better leverage the 3D structural information of point clouds, we employ a cascaded graph transformer (graphormer) to introduce point cloud features during sparse-to-dense reconstruction. Experimental results on three publicly available databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

| **[Graph Transformer Networks for Accurate Band Structure Prediction: An End-to-End Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16483v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting electronic band structures from crystal structures is crucial for understanding structure-property correlations in materials science. First-principles approaches are accurate but computationally intensive. Recent years, machine learning (ML) has been extensively applied to this field, while existing ML models predominantly focus on band gap predictions or indirect band structure estimation via solving predicted Hamiltonians. An end-to-end model to predict band structure accurately and efficiently is still lacking. Here, we introduce a graph Transformer-based end-to-end approach that directly predicts band structures from crystal structures with high accuracy. Our method leverages the continuity of the k-path and treat continuous bands as a sequence. We demonstrate that our model not only provides accurate band structure predictions but also can derive other properties (such as band gap, band center, and band dispersion) with high accuracy. We verify the model performance on large and diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Integrated Multimodal Concept Bottleneck Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00701v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning. MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Functional awareness Transformer-based graph archetype contrastive learning for Decoding Visual Neural Representations from EEG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24761v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a formidable challenge due to their high-dimensional, noisy, and non-Euclidean nature. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG) framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics. To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more generalizable and robust neural representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEIST: A Graph Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics and Proteomics Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11152v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics have become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and gene expression at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Graph Neural Networks are Incomplete on Graphs with a Simple Spectrum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05530v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet, these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on graphs from ZINC.</p></details> | 10 pages main text |
| **[AI-Enhanced Multi-Dimensional Measurement of Technological Convergence through Heterogeneous Graph and Semantic Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21187v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technological convergence refers to the phenomenon where boundaries between technological areas and disciplines are increasingly blurred. It enables the integration of previously distinct domains and has become a mainstream trend in today's innovation process. However, accurately measuring technological convergence remains a persistent challenge due to its inherently multidimensional and evolving nature. This study designs an Technological Convergence Index (TCI) that comprehensively measures convergence along two fundamental dimensions: depth and breadth. For depth calculation, we use IPC textual descriptions as the analytical foundation and enhance this assessment by incorporating supplementary patent metadata into a heterogeneous graph structure. This graph is then modeled using Heterogeneous Graph Transformers in combination with Sentence-BERT, enabling a precise representation of knowledge integration across technological boundaries. Complementing this, the breadth dimension captures the diversity of technological fields involved, quantified through the Shannon Diversity Index to measure the variety of technological combinations within patents. Our final TCI is constructed using the Entropy Weight Method, which objectively assigns weights to both dimensions based on their information entropy. To validate our approach, we compare the proposed TCI against established convergence measures, demonstrating its comparative advantages. We further establish empirical reliability through a novel robustness test that regresses TCI against indicators of patent quality. These findings are further substantiated through comprehensive robustness checks. Our multidimensional approach provides valuable practical insights for innovation policy and industry strategies in managing emerging cross-domain technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphUniverse: Enabling Systematic Evaluation of Inductive Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21097v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph, transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure. Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at https://graphuniverse.streamlit.app.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Graph-Transformer Out-of-Distribution Generalization Abilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20575v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID) benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts. Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without specialized DG algorithms (on four out of six benchmarks). Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets, specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Highlighting its model-agnostic design, the method yielded valuable insights into both GT and MPNN backbones and appears well suited for broader DG applications beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.</p></details> |  |

Accurate classification of ncRNAs is essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis. To address existing limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion, we propose HGMamba-ncRNA, a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model, which integrates sequence, secondary structure, and optionally available expression features of ncRNAs to enhance classification performance. Specifically, the sequence of ncRNA is modeled using a parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM architecture (MKC-L) to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies of nucleotides. The structure modality employs a multi-scale graph transformer (MSGraphTransformer) to represent the multi-level topological characteristics of ncRNA secondary structures. The expression modality utilizes a Chebyshev Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CPKAN) to effectively model and interpret high-dimensional expression profiles. Finally, by incorporating virtual nodes to facilitate efficient and comprehensive multimodal interaction, HyperGraphMamba is proposed to adaptively align and integrate multichannel heterogeneous modality features. Experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Extensive empirical studies further confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong transferability, offering a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA functional classification.

| **[Local equivalence of stabilizer states: a graphical characterisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20183v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stabilizer states form a ubiquitous family of quantum states that can be graphically represented through the graph state formalism. A fundamental property of graph states is that applying a local complementation - a well-known and extensively studied graph transformation - results in a graph that represents the same entanglement as the original. In other words, the corresponding graph states are LU-equivalent. This property served as the cornerstone for capturing non-trivial quantum properties in a simple graphical manner, in the study of quantum entanglement but also for developing protocols and models based on graph states and stabilizer states, such as measurement-based quantum computing, secret sharing, error correction, entanglement distribution... However, local complementation fails short to fully characterise entanglement: there exist pairs of graph states that are LU-equivalent but cannot be transformed one into the other using local complementations. Only few is known about the equivalence of graph states beyond local complementation. We introduce a generalisation of local complementation which graphically characterises the LU-equivalence of graph states. We use this characterisation to show the existence of a strict infinite hierarchy of equivalences of graph states. Our approach is based on minimal local sets, which are subsets of vertices that are known to cover any graph, and to be invariant under local complementation and even LU-equivalence. We use these structures to provide a type to each vertex of a graph, leading to a natural standard form in which the LU-equivalence can be exhibited and captured by means of generalised local complementation.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method, IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology. The code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IPGPhormer-6EEB.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

We present SolarCAST, a causally informed model predicting future global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a target site using only historical GHI from site X and nearby stations S - unlike prior work that relies on sky-camera or satellite imagery requiring specialized hardware and heavy preprocessing. To deliver high accuracy with only public sensor data, SolarCAST models three classes of confounding factors behind X-S correlations using scalable neural components: (i) observable synchronous variables (e.g., time of day, station identity), handled via an embedding module; (ii) latent synchronous factors (e.g., regional weather patterns), captured by a spatio-temporal graph neural network; and (iii) time-lagged influences (e.g., cloud movement across stations), modeled with a gated transformer that learns temporal shifts. It outperforms leading time-series and multimodal baselines across diverse geographical conditions, and achieves a 25.9% error reduction over the top commercial forecaster, Solcast. SolarCAST offers a lightweight, practical, and generalizable solution for localized solar forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2025</p></details> |

The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer, featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping linear complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12694v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural architecture designed for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages with 3 figures and 2 tables, submitted to IEEE for a possible publication</p></details> |
| **[State Space Models over Directed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13735v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed graphs are ubiquitous across numerous domains, where the directionality of edges encodes critical causal dependencies. However, existing GNNs and graph Transformers tailored for directed graphs face two major challenges: (1) effectively capturing long-range causal dependencies derived from directed edges; (2) balancing accuracy and training efficiency when processing large-scale graph datasets. In recent years, state space models (SSMs) have achieved substantial progress in causal sequence tasks, and their variants designed for graphs have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining high efficiency across various graph learning benchmarks. However, existing graph state space models are exclusively designed for undirected graphs, which limits their performance in directed graph learning. To this end, we propose an innovative approach DirEgo2Token which sequentializes directed graphs via k-hop ego graphs. This marks the first systematic extension of state space models to the field of directed graph learning. Building upon this, we develop DirGraphSSM, a novel directed graph neural network architecture that implements state space models on directed graphs via the message-passing mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that DirGraphSSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three representative directed graph learning tasks while attaining competitive performance on two additional tasks with 1.5$\times $ to 2$\times $ training speed improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently undergoing review by IEEE Transactions on Big Data</p></details> |

Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approaches typically formulate ARE as a sequential decision-making problem defined on a collision-free informative graph. However, these methods often demonstrate limited reasoning ability over graph-structured data. Moreover, due to the insufficient consideration of robot motion, the resulting RL policies are generally optimized to minimize travel distance, while neglecting time efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRATE, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approach that leverages a Graph Transformer to effectively capture both local structure patterns and global contextual dependencies of the informative graph, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning capability across the entire environment. In addition, we deploy a Kalman filter to smooth the waypoint outputs, ensuring that the resulting path is kinodynamically feasible for the robot to follow. Experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits better exploration efficiency (up to 21.5% in distance and 21.3% in time to complete exploration) than state-of-the-art conventional and learning-based baselines in various simulation benchmarks. We also validate our planner in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Homophily Booster: Rethinking the Role of Discrete Features on Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12530v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs.</p></details> | 14 pages |

We introduce a graph transformer-based NQS framework able to represent arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and develop an error control mechanism to stabilise iterative updates throughout the quantum embedding loops. We validate the accuracy of our approach with benchmark gGA calculations of the Anderson Lattice Model, yielding results in excellent agreement with the exact diagonalisation impurity solver. Finally, our analysis of the computational budget reveals the method's principal bottleneck to be the high-accuracy sampling of physical observables required by the embedding loop, rather than the NQS variational optimisation, directly highlighting the critical need for more efficient inference techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, and 4 figures.

| **[GTHNA: Local-global Graph Transformer with Memory Reconstruction for Holistic Node Anomaly Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10869v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in graph-structured data is an inherently challenging problem, as it requires the identification of rare nodes that deviate from the majority in both their structural and behavioral characteristics. Existing methods, such as those based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), often suffer from over-smoothing, which causes the learned node representations to become indistinguishable. Furthermore, graph reconstruction-based approaches are vulnerable to anomalous node interference during the reconstruction process, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a novel and holistic anomaly evaluation framework that integrates three key components: a local-global Transformer encoder, a memory-guided reconstruction mechanism, and a multi-scale representation matching strategy. These components work synergistically to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and global structural dependencies, suppress the influence of anomalous nodes, and assess anomalies from multiple levels of granularity. Anomaly scores are computed by combining reconstruction errors and memory matching signals, resulting in a more robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering a comprehensive and generalizable solution for anomaly detection across various graph domains.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Database Views as Explanations for Relational Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09482v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash, Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSRFormer: Road Network Representation Learning using Multi-scale Feature Fusion of Heterogeneous Spatial Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05685v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer, MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections, which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow heterogeneity of spatial interactions.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective cross-lingual generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Found...</summary><p>Found some issues and need to correct them</p></details> |

However, in tasks involving natural language and programming language (NL-PL) artifacts, relying solely on textual similarity is limited by their semantic gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical evaluation across various types of TLR tasks, revealing the limitations of textual similarity in NL-PL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an approach that incorporates multiple domain-specific auxiliary strategies, identified through empirical analysis, into two models: the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via edge types and the prompt-based Gemini 2.5 Pro via additional input information. We then evaluated our approach using the widely studied requirements-to-code TLR task, a representative case of NL-PL TLR. Experimental results show that both the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models outperformed their original counterparts without strategy integration. Furthermore, compared to the current state-of-the-art method HGNNLink, the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models achieved average F1-score improvements of 3.68% and 8.84%, respectively, across twelve open-source projects, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy integration in enhancing overall model performance for the requirements-code TLR task.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 5 images, 11 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |

While traditional machine learning (ML) approaches are widely used, they struggle to capture spatial dependencies and poor boundary delineation between susceptibility classes. This study introduces the first application of a graph transformer (GT) architecture for flood susceptibility mapping to the flood-prone French Riviera (e.g., 2020 Storm Alex) using topography, hydrology, geography, and environmental data. GT incorporates watershed topology using Laplacian positional encoders (PEs) and attention mechanisms. The developed GT model has an AUC-ROC (0.9739), slightly lower than XGBoost (0.9853). However, the GT model demonstrated better clustering and delineation with a higher Moran's I value (0.6119) compared to the random forest (0.5775) and XGBoost (0.5311) with p-value lower than 0.0001. Feature importance revealed a striking consistency across models, with elevation, slope, distance to channel, and convergence index being the critical factors. Dimensionality reduction on Laplacian PEs revealed partial clusters, indicating they could capture spatial information; however, their importance was lower than flood factors. Since climate and land use changes aggravate flood risk, susceptibility maps are developed for the 2050 year under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and railway track vulnerability is assessed. All RCP scenarios revealed increased area across susceptibility classes, except for the very low category. RCP 8.5 projections indicate that 17.46% of the watershed area and 54% of railway length fall within very-high susceptible zones, compared to 6.19% and 35.61%, respectively, under current conditions. The developed maps can be integrated into a multi-hazard framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained, local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance. Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.</p></details> |  |

Graph Transformers (GTs) mitigate this via global self-attention, yet their quadratic cost in the number of nodes limits scalability. We propose Graph Elimination Networks (GENs), an MPNN variant that approximates GT-like long-range modeling while maintaining high efficiency. GENs combine edge-wise and hop-wise self-attention in parallel; their multiplicative composition yields an attention kernel separable across edge and hop factors within a bounded K-hop receptive field. To enable hop-wise attention, we introduce the Graph Elimination Algorithm (GEA), which prevents double counting across hops, ensuring that each round injects the k-hop incremental contribution exactly once. Taking differences between successive rounds recovers the k-hop increment and yields disentangled multi-hop features as inputs for hop-wise attention. This preserves clearer structural distinctions across hop distances and enables more faithful modeling of pairwise dependencies between distant nodes within the K-hop neighborhood. On the Long-Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB), GENs outperform strong MPNN baselines by 7.7 and 6.0 percentage points (pp) on PascalVOC-SP and COCO-SP, and achieve performance on par with or better than state-of-the-art Graph Transformers. On OGBN-Products, GENs support full-batch training/inference, while sparse-attention baselines like Exphormer struggle with memory limits under comparable budgets, highlighting GENs as a practical alternative for large, sparse graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inclu...</summary><p>Includes 11 pages of main text and 6 pages of appendices</p></details> |

Integrating graph generation with these instructions is complex, leading most current methods to use molecular sequences with pre-trained large language models. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel framework, named $\textbf{UTGDiff (Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model)}$, which utilizes language models for discrete graph diffusion to generate molecular graphs from instructions. UTGDiff features a unified text-graph transformer as the denoising network, derived from pre-trained language models and minimally modified to process graph data through attention bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that UTGDiff consistently outperforms sequence-based baselines in tasks involving instruction-based molecule generation and editing, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters given an equivalent level of pretraining corpus.

Graph transformers have become increasingly important in graph learning for their ability to utilize long-range node communication explicitly, addressing limitations such as oversmoothing and oversquashing found in message-passing graph networks. However, their dense attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of nodes, limiting their applicability to large-scale graphs. ReHub draws inspiration from the airline industry's hub-and-spoke model, where flights are assigned to optimize operational efficiency. In our approach, graph nodes (spokes) are dynamically reassigned to a fixed number of virtual nodes (hubs) at each model layer. Recent work, Neural Atoms (Li et al., 2024), has demonstrated impressive and consistent improvements over GNN baselines by utilizing such virtual nodes; their findings suggest that the number of hubs strongly influences performance. However, increasing the number of hubs typically raises complexity, requiring a trade-off to maintain linear complexity. Our key insight is that each node only needs to interact with a small subset of hubs to achieve linear complexity, even when the total number of hubs is large. To leverage all hubs without incurring additional computational costs, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive reassignment technique based on hub-hub similarity scores, eliminating the need for expensive node-hub computations. Our experiments on LRGB indicate a consistent improvement in results over the base method, Neural Atoms, while maintaining a linear complexity. Remarkably, our sparse model achieves performance on par with its non-sparse counterpart. Furthermore, ReHub outperforms competitive baselines and consistently ranks among top performers across various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025.

These architectures have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size, adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller. The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while having a similar training speed.

This enables precise control over both the content and temporal structure of the generated audio. Despite recent progress, existing methods still face inherent trade-offs among accurate temporal localization, open-vocabulary scalability, and practical efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose DegDiT, a novel dynamic event graph-guided diffusion transformer framework for open-vocabulary controllable audio generation. DegDiT encodes the events in the description as structured dynamic graphs. The nodes in each graph are designed to represent three aspects: semantic features, temporal attributes, and inter-event connections. A graph transformer is employed to integrate these nodes and produce contextualized event embeddings that serve as guidance for the diffusion model. To ensure high-quality and diverse training data, we introduce a quality-balanced data selection pipeline that combines hierarchical event annotation with multi-criteria quality scoring, resulting in a curated dataset with semantic diversity. Furthermore, we present consensus preference optimization, facilitating audio generation through consensus among multiple reward signals. Extensive experiments on AudioCondition, DESED, and AudioTime datasets demonstrate that DegDiT achieves state-of-the-art performances across a variety of objective and subjective evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, cross-subject generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to individual variability, cognitive traits, and emotional responses. We propose FreqDGT, a frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer that systematically addresses these limitations through an integrated framework. FreqDGT introduces frequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant frequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic graph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and implements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines hierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to capture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of integrating frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical modeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences.

These transformations include segmenting images, extracting features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805 without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches. With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to 0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.</p></details> |  |

However, searching for prior art is challenging due to the large number of patent documents and the need for nuanced comparisons to determine novelty. An accurate search engine is therefore invaluable for speeding up the process. We present a Graph Transformer-based dense retrieval method for patent searching where each invention is represented by a graph describing its features and their relationships. Our model processes these invention graphs and is trained using prior art citations from patent office examiners as relevance signals. Using graphs as input significantly improves the computational efficiency of processing long documents, while leveraging examiner citations allows the model to learn domain-specific similarities beyond simple text-based matching. The result is a search engine that emulates how professional patent examiners identify relevant documents. We compare our approach against publicly available text embedding models and show substantial improvements in both prior art retrieval quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the PatentSemTech 2025 workshop, held in conjunction with SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Graph Attention Network for No-Reference Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09843v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment (OIQA) methods struggle to evaluate locally non-uniform distortions due to inadequate modeling of spatial variations in quality and ineffective feature representation capturing both local details and global context. To address this, we propose a graph neural network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity. Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation. To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Omics Analysis for Cancer Subtype Inference via Unrolling Graph Smoothness Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06257v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating multi-omics datasets through data-driven analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of the complex biological processes underlying various diseases, particularly cancer. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently demonstrated remarkable ability to exploit relational structures in biological data, enabling advances in multi-omics integration for cancer subtype classification. Existing approaches often neglect the intricate coupling between heterogeneous omics, limiting their capacity to resolve subtle cancer subtype heterogeneity critical for precision oncology. To address these limitations, we propose a framework named Graph Transformer for Multi-omics Cancer Subtype Classification (GTMancer). This framework builds upon the GNN optimization problem and extends its application to complex multi-omics data. Specifically, our method leverages contrastive learning to embed multi-omics data into a unified semantic space. We unroll the multiplex graph optimization problem in that unified space and introduce dual sets of attention coefficients to capture structural graph priors both within and among multi-omics data. This approach enables global omics information to guide the refining of the representations of individual omics. Empirical experiments on seven real-world cancer datasets demonstrate that GTMancer outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Bottleneck-Guided Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Interpretable Neurodevelopmental Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20769v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing interpretable models for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) diagnosis presents significant challenges in effectively encoding, decoding, and integrating multimodal neuroimaging data. While many existing machine learning approaches have shown promise in brain network analysis, they typically suffer from limited interpretability, particularly in extracting meaningful biomarkers from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and establishing clear relationships between imaging features and demographic characteristics. Besides, current graph neural network methodologies face limitations in capturing both local and global functional connectivity patterns while simultaneously achieving theoretically principled multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a unified framework that applies information bottleneck principles to guide both brain connectivity modeling and cross-modal feature integration. This framework comprises two complementary components. The first is the Information Bottleneck Graph Transformer (IBGraphFormer), which combines transformer-based global attention mechanisms with graph neural networks through information bottleneck-guided pooling to identify sufficient biomarkers. The second is the Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (IB-HGAN), which employs meta-path-based heterogeneous graph learning with structural consistency constraints to achieve interpretable fusion of neuroimaging and demographic data. The experimental results demonstrate that I2B-HGNN achieves superior performance in diagnosing NDDs, exhibiting both high classification accuracy and the ability to provide interpretable biomarker identification while effectively analyzing non-imaging data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual Graph Transformer: A Small Language Model for Enhanced Engineering Document Information Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02532v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text, often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering. CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram, and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical domains often require specialized language models with stronger contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7% higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented responses in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Generative Modeling of Grounded Scene Graphs and Images via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01130v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a framework for joint grounded scene graph - image generation, a challenging task involving high-dimensional, multi-modal structured data. To effectively model this complex joint distribution, we adopt a factorized approach: first generating a grounded scene graph, followed by image generation conditioned on the generated grounded scene graph. While conditional image generation has been widely explored in the literature, our primary focus is on the generation of grounded scene graphs from noise, which provides efficient and interpretable control over the image generation process. This task requires generating plausible grounded scene graphs with heterogeneous attributes for both nodes (objects) and edges (relations among objects), encompassing continuous attributes (e.g., object bounding boxes) and discrete attributes (e.g., object and relation categories). To address this challenge, we introduce DiffuseSG, a novel diffusion model that jointly models the heterogeneous node and edge attributes. We explore different encoding strategies to effectively handle the categorical data. Leveraging a graph transformer as the denoiser, DiffuseSG progressively refines grounded scene graph representations in a continuous space before discretizing them to generate structured outputs. Additionally, we introduce an IoU-based regularization term to enhance empirical performance. Our model outperforms existing methods in grounded scene graph generation on the VG and COCO-Stuff datasets, excelling in both standard and newly introduced metrics that more accurately capture the task's complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the broader applicability of DiffuseSG in two important downstream tasks: 1) achieving superior results in a range of grounded scene graph completion tasks, and 2) enhancing grounded scene graph detection models by leveraging additional training samples generated by DiffuseSG.</p></details> |  |

We study the expressive power of graph transformers (GTs) by Dwivedi and Bresson (2020) and GPS-networks by Ramp\'asek et al. (2022), both under soft-attention and average hard-attention. Our study covers two scenarios: the theoretical setting with real numbers and the more practical case with floats. With reals, we show that in restriction to vertex properties definable in first-order logic (FO), GPS-networks have the same expressive power as graded modal logic (GML) with the global modality. With floats, GPS-networks turn out to be equally expressive as GML with the counting global modality. The latter result is absolute, not restricting to properties definable in a background logic. We also obtain similar characterizations for GTs in terms of propositional logic with the global modality (for reals) and the counting global modality (for floats).</p></details> |  |
| **[Invariant Graph Transformer for Out-of-Distribution Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00304v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated great effectiveness across various graph analytical tasks. However, the existing GTs focus on training and testing graph data originated from the same distribution, but fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Graph invariant learning, aiming to capture generalizable graph structural patterns with labels under distribution shifts, is potentially a promising solution, but how to design attention mechanisms and positional and structural encodings (PSEs) based on graph invariant learning principles remains challenging. To solve these challenges, we introduce Graph Out-Of-Distribution generalized Transformer (GOODFormer), aiming to learn generalized graph representations by capturing invariant relationships between predictive graph structures and labels through jointly optimizing three modules. Specifically, we first develop a GT-based entropy-guided invariant subgraph disentangler to separate invariant and variant subgraphs while preserving the sharpness of the attention function. Next, we design an evolving subgraph positional and structural encoder to effectively and efficiently capture the encoding information of dynamically changing subgraphs during training. Finally, we propose an invariant learning module utilizing subgraph node representations and encodings to derive generalizable graph representations that can to unseen graphs. We also provide theoretical justifications for our method. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using weakest application conditions to rank graph transformations for graph repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08788v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When using graphs and graph transformations to model systems, consistency is an important concern. While consistency has primarily been viewed as a binary property, i.e., a graph is consistent or inconsistent with respect to a set of constraints, recent work has presented an approach to consistency as a graduated property. This allows living with inconsistencies for a while and repairing them when necessary. For repairing inconsistencies in a graph, we use graph transformation rules with so-called {\em impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions} to understand how much repair gain certain rule applications would bring. Both types of conditions can be derived from given graph constraints. Our main theorem shows that the difference between the number of actual constraint violations before and after a graph transformation step can be characterized by the difference between the numbers of violated impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions. This theory forms the basis for algorithms with look-ahead that rank graph transformations according to their potential for graph repair. An evaluation shows that graph repair can be well supported by rules with these new types of application conditions in terms of effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 25 Figures, new, more efficient method for constructing application conditions, theoretical comparison to other concepts of consistency, extended evaluation</p></details> |
| **[WOCD: A Semi-Supervised Method for Overlapping Community Detection Using Weak Cliques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00927v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Overlapping community detection (OCD) is a fundamental graph data analysis task for extracting graph patterns. Traditional OCD methods can be broadly divided into node clustering and link clustering approaches, both of which rely solely on link information to identify overlapping communities. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have made significant advancements for this task. However, existing GNN-based approaches often face difficulties in effectively integrating link, attribute, and prior information, along with challenges like limited receptive fields and over-smoothing, which hinder their performance on complex overlapping community detection. In this paper, we propose a Weak-clique based Overlapping Community Detection method, namely WOCD, which incorporates prior information and optimizes the use of link information to improve detection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce pseudo-labels within a semi-supervised framework to strengthen the generalization ability, making WOCD more versatile. Furthermore, we initialize pseudo-labels using weak cliques to fully leverage link and prior information, leading to better detection accuracy. Additionally, we employ a single-layer Graph Transformer combined with GNN, which achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining efficiency. We evaluate WOCD on eight real-world attributed datasets, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised OCD method by a significant margin in terms of accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Obfuscation: Cluster-Aware Graph with LLM-Aided Recovery for Malicious JavaScript Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22447v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid expansion of web-based applications and cloud services, malicious JavaScript code continues to pose significant threats to user privacy, system integrity, and enterprise security. But, detecting such threats remains challenging due to sophisticated code obfuscation techniques and JavaScript's inherent language characteristics, particularly its nested closure structures and syntactic flexibility. In this work, we propose DeCoda, a hybrid defense framework that combines large language model (LLM)-based deobfuscation with code graph learning: (1) We first construct a sophisticated prompt-learning pipeline with multi-stage refinement, where the LLM progressively reconstructs the original code structure from obfuscated inputs and then generates normalized Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representations; (2) In JavaScript ASTs, dynamic typing scatters semantically similar nodes while deeply nested functions fracture scope capturing, introducing structural noise and semantic ambiguity. To address these challenges, we then propose to learn hierarchical code graph representations via a Cluster-wise Graph that synergistically integrates graph transformer network, node clustering, and node-to-cluster attention to simultaneously capture both local node-level semantics and global cluster-induced structural relationships from AST graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves F1-scores of 94.64% and 97.71% on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating absolute improvements of 10.74% and 13.85% over state-of-the-art baselines. In false-positive control evaluation at fixed FPR levels (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01), our approach delivers 4.82, 5.91, and 2.53 higher TPR respectively compared to the best-performing baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-based deobfuscation and underscore the importance of modeling cluster-level relationships in detecting malicious code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rule-Based Graph Programs Matching the Time Complexity of Imperative Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09144v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on recent advances in rule-based graph programming, which allow us to match the time complexity of some fundamental imperative graph algorithms. In general, achieving the time complexity of graph algorithms implemented in conventional languages using a rule-based graph-transformation language is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be implemented in the graph programming language GP 2 such that their runtime matches the time complexity of imperative implementations. However, this required input graphs to have a bounded node degree and (for some algorithms) to be connected. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies: the first program checks whether input graphs are connected, the second program checks whether input graphs are acyclic, and the third program solves the single-source shortest-paths problem for graphs with integer edge-weights. The first two programs run in linear time on (possibly disconnected) input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. The third program runs in time $O(nm)$ on arbitrary input graphs, matching the time complexity of imperative implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. For each program, we formally prove its correctness and time complexity, and provide runtime experiments on various graph classes.</p></details> |  |

This study systematically benchmarked classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN)) for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data. This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version; a revised version will be uploaded later</p></details> |

However, the dynamic traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various real-world traffic networks.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges such as over-smoothing and over-compression remain when handling large-scale and complex graph datasets, leading to a decline in clustering quality. Although the Graph Transformer architecture has mitigated some of these issues, its performance is still limited when processing heterogeneous graph data. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep clustering framework that comprising GCN, Autoencoder (AE), and Graph Transformer, termed the Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network (Tri-GFN). This framework enhances the differentiation and consistency of global and local information through a unique tri-learning mechanism and feature fusion enhancement strategy. The framework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer modules. These components are meticulously fused by a triple-channel enhancement module, which maximizes the use of both node attributes and topological structures, ensuring robust clustering representation. The tri-learning mechanism allows mutual learning among these modules, while the feature fusion strategy enables the model to capture complex relationships, yielding highly discriminative representations for graph clustering. It surpasses many state-of-the-art methods, achieving an accuracy improvement of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14 % on the Reuters dataset, and 7.58 % on the USPS dataset. Due to its outstanding performance on the Reuters dataset, Tri-GFN can be applied to automatic news classification, topic retrieval, and related fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code for this study is available at https://github.com/YF-W/Tri-GFN</p></details> |

Here, we propose MGT, a multi-view graph transformer framework that synergistically fuses SE3 invariant and SO3 equivariant graph representations, which respectively captures rotation-translation invariance and rotation equivariance in crystal geometries. To strategically incorporate these complementary geometric representations, we employ a lightweight mixture of experts router in MGT to adaptively adjust the weight assigned to SE3 and SO3 embeddings based on the specific target task. Compared with previous state-of-the-art models, MGT reduces the mean absolute error by up to 21% on crystal property prediction tasks through multi-task self-supervised pretraining. Ablation experiments and interpretable investigations confirm the effectiveness of each technique implemented in our framework. Additionally, in transfer learning scenarios including crystal catalyst adsorption energy and hybrid perovskite bandgap prediction, MGT achieves performance improvements of up to 58% over existing baselines, demonstrating domain-agnostic scalability across diverse application domains. As evidenced by the above series of studies, we believe that MGT can serve as useful model for crystal material property prediction, providing a valuable tool for the discovery of novel materials.</p></details> |  |

The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes in the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use critical pair analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the CPA is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>Intermediate preprint (revision #1) for submission to ICGT 24 Special Issue in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |

While it conventionally relies on meticulous feature engineering, deep learning techniques have recently shown a great promise in learning effective player and team representations directly for soccer outcome prediction. However, existing methods often overlook the heterogeneous nature of interactions among players and teams, which is crucial for accurately modeling match dynamics. To address this gap, we propose HIGFormer (Heterogeneous Interaction Graph Transformer), a novel graph-augmented transformer-based deep learning model for soccer outcome prediction. HIGFormer introduces a multi-level interaction framework that captures both fine-grained player dynamics and high-level team interactions. Specifically, it comprises (1) a Player Interaction Network, which encodes player performance through heterogeneous interaction graphs, combining local graph convolutions with a global graph-augmented transformer; (2) a Team Interaction Network, which constructs interaction graphs from a team-to-team perspective to model historical match relationships; and (3) a Match Comparison Transformer, which jointly analyzes both team and player-level information to predict match outcomes. Extensive experiments on the WyScout Open Access Dataset, a large-scale real-world soccer dataset, demonstrate that HIGFormer significantly outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we provide valuable insights into leveraging our model for player performance evaluation, offering a new perspective on talent scouting and team strategy analysis.</p></details> |  |

These changes are inherently discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete spaces for reaction prediction.</p></details> | 22pages, 2 figures |

Radar sensors, capable of penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks, including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture long-range dependencies.

Radar sensors, capable of penetrating ice, capture detailed radargram images of internal ice layers. In this work, we introduce GRIT, graph transformer for ice layer thickness. GRIT integrates an inductive geometric graph learning framework with an attention mechanism, designed to map the relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers. Compared to baseline graph neural networks, GRIT demonstrates consistently lower prediction errors. These results highlight the attention mechanism's effectiveness in capturing temporal changes across ice layers, while the graph transformer combines the strengths of transformers for learning long-range dependencies with graph neural networks for capturing spatial patterns, enabling robust modeling of complex spatiotemporal dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Manifold Embeddings for Enhanced Graph Transformer Representations and Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07335v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space, blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold, mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure. These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space. Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured. Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making graph representations more interpretable.</p></details> |  |

However, training deep learning models for AMS designs is severely limited by the scarcity of integrated circuit design data. In this work, we present CircuitGPS, a few-shot learning method for parasitic effect prediction in AMS circuits. The circuit netlist is represented as a heterogeneous graph, with the coupling capacitance modeled as a link. CircuitGPS is pre-trained on link prediction and fine-tuned on edge regression. The proposed method starts with a small-hop sampling technique that converts a link or a node into a subgraph. Then, the subgraph embeddings are learned with a hybrid graph Transformer. Additionally, CircuitGPS integrates a low-cost positional encoding that summarizes the positional and structural information of the sampled subgraph. CircuitGPS improves the accuracy of coupling existence by at least 20\% and reduces the MAE of capacitance estimation by at least 0.067 compared to existing methods. Our method demonstrates strong inherent scalability, enabling direct application to diverse AMS circuit designs through zero-shot learning. Furthermore, the ablation studies provide valuable insights into graph models for representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of DAC2025</p></details> |

Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork) framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2) spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries. Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[NTSFormer: A Self-Teaching Graph Transformer for Multimodal Cold-Start Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04870v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because cold-start nodes are isolated (i.e., no edges) and often have missing modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However, this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student" prediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature data into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion. Experimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior performance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphGSOcc: Semantic-Geometric Graph Transformer with Dynamic-Static Decoupling for 3D Gaussian Splatting-based Occupancy Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14825v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among similar categories and across regions, (2) boundary ambiguities caused by the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization and (3) biased issues in dynamic-static object coupling optimization. We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer and decouples dynamic-static objects optimization for 3D Gaussian Splatting-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarsegrained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. On the other hand, we decouple dynamic and static objects by leveraging semantic probability distributions and design a Dynamic-Static Decoupled Gaussian Attention mechanism to optimize the prediction performance for both dynamic objects and static scenes. GraphGSOcc achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, OpenOcc and KITTI occupancy benchmarks. Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 25.20%, reducing GPU memory to 6.8 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple Approximations for General Spanner Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23638v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider a graph with n nodes and m edges, independent edge weights and lengths, and arbitrary distance demands for node pairs. The spanner problem asks for a minimum-weight subgraph that satisfies these demands via sufficiently short paths w.r.t. the edge lengths. For multiplicative alpha-spanners (where demands equal alpha times the original distances) and assuming that each edge's weight equals its length, the simple Greedy heuristic by Alth\"ofer et al. (1993) is known to yield strong solutions, both in theory and practice. To obtain guarantees in more general settings, recent approximations typically abandon this simplicity and practicality. Still, so far, there is no known non-trivial approximation algorithm for the spanner problem in its most general form. We provide two surprisingly simple approximations algorithms. In general, our Augmented Greedy achieves the first unconditional approximation ratio of m, which is non-trivial due to the independence of weights and lengths. Crucially, it maintains all size and weight guarantees Greedy is known for, i.e., in the aforementioned multiplicative alpha-spanner scenario and even for additive +beta-spanners. Further, it generalizes some of these size guarantees to derive new weight guarantees. Our second approach, Randomized Rounding, establishes a graph transformation that allows a simple rounding scheme over a standard multicommodity flow LP. It yields an O(n log n)-approximation, assuming integer lengths and polynomially bounded distance demands. The only other known approximation guarantee in this general setting requires several complex subalgorithms and analyses, yet we match it up to a factor of O(n^{1/5-eps}) using standard tools. Further, on bounded-degree graphs, we yield the first O(log n) approximation ratio for constant-bounded distance demands (beyond multiplicative 2-spanners in unit-length graphs).</p></details> |  |
| **[FoGE: Fock Space inspired encoding for graph prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02937v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based structures effortlessly.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study of Dynamic Stock Relationship Modeling and S&P500 Price Forecasting Based on Differential Graph Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18717v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock price prediction is vital for investment decisions and risk management, yet remains challenging due to markets' nonlinear dynamics and time-varying inter-stock correlations. Traditional static-correlation models fail to capture evolving stock relationships. To address this, we propose a Differential Graph Transformer (DGT) framework for dynamic relationship modeling and price prediction. Our DGT integrates sequential graph structure changes into multi-head self-attention via a differential graph mechanism, adaptively preserving high-value connections while suppressing noise. Causal temporal attention captures global/local dependencies in price sequences. We further evaluate correlation metrics (Pearson, Mutual Information, Spearman, Kendall's Tau) across global/local/dual scopes as spatial-attention priors. Using 10 years of S&P 500 closing prices (z-score normalized; 64-day sliding windows), DGT with spatial priors outperformed GRU baselines (RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87). Kendall's Tau global matrices yielded optimal results (MAE: 0.11). K-means clustering revealed "high-volatility growth" and "defensive blue-chip" stocks, with the latter showing lower errors (RMSE: 0.13) due to stable correlations. Kendall's Tau and Mutual Information excelled in volatile sectors. This study innovatively combines differential graph structures with Transformers, validating dynamic relationship modeling and identifying optimal correlation metrics/scopes. Clustering analysis supports tailored quantitative strategies. Our framework advances financial time-series prediction through dynamic modeling and cross-asset interaction analysis.</p></details> |  |

We introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight, parameter-efficient foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being pre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong multimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a unified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models structural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph transformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful, modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification, prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our model revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a unique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration). BrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can surpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and powerful research in computational neuroscience.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

For non-Euclidean data, e.g., graphs, that particularly involves topological structures, one important aspect neglected by prior studies is how machine learning models generalize under topological shifts. This paper proposes Advective Diffusion Transformer (AdvDIFFormer), a physics-inspired graph Transformer model designed to address this challenge. The model is derived from advective diffusion equations which describe a class of continuous message passing process with observed and latent topological structures. We show that AdvDIFFormer has provable capability for controlling generalization error with topological shifts, which in contrast cannot be guaranteed by graph diffusion models, i.e., the generalized formulation of common graph neural networks in continuous space. Empirically, the model demonstrates superiority in various predictive tasks across information networks, molecular screening and protein interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient Few-shot Graph Neural Architecture Search via Partitioning Gradient Contribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01231v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the weight coupling problem, certain studies introduced few-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, which partition the supernet into multiple sub-supernets. However, these methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules. Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Representation Learning with Mutual Influence of Modalities for Node Classification in Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07895v3)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities. Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal data, especially when accompanied with network structures.</p></details> |  |

We propose Pieceformer, a scalable, self-supervised similarity assessment framework, equipped with a hybrid message-passing and graph transformer encoder. To address transformer scalability, we incorporate a linear transformer backbone and introduce a partitioned training pipeline for efficient memory and parallelism management. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world CircuitNet datasets show that Pieceformer reduces mean absolute error (MAE) by 24.9% over the baseline and is the only method to correctly cluster all real-world design groups. We further demonstrate the practical usage of our model through a case study on a partitioning task, achieving up to 89% runtime reduction.

GITO consists of two main modules: a hybrid graph transformer (HGT) and a transformer neural operator (TNO). HGT leverages a graph neural network (GNN) to encode local spatial relationships and a transformer to capture long-range dependencies. A self-attention fusion layer integrates the outputs of the GNN and transformer to enable more expressive feature learning on graph-structured data. TNO module employs linear-complexity cross-attention and self-attention layers to map encoded input functions to predictions at arbitrary query locations, ensuring discretization invariance and enabling zero-shot super-resolution across any mesh. Empirical results on benchmark PDE tasks demonstrate that GITO outperforms existing transformer-based neural operators, paving the way for efficient, mesh-agnostic surrogate solvers in engineering applications.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that, by effectively encoding ego-graphs (1-hop neighbourhoods), we can reduce the reliance on resource-intensive textual encoders. This makes the model both fast at training and inference time, as well as frugal in terms of cost. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on three popular datasets and show that FnF-TG can achieve superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. We also extend inductive learning to a fully inductive setting, where relations don't rely on transductive (fixed) representations, as in previous work, but are a function of their textual description. Additionally, we introduce new variants of existing datasets, specifically designed to test the performance of models on unseen relations at inference time, thus offering a new test-bench for fully inductive link prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Existing research has leveraged text-attributed graphs (TAGs) to tackle the heterogeneity in node features among graphs. However, they primarily focus on homogeneous TAGs (HoTAGs), leaving heterogeneous TAGs (HeTAGs), where multiple types of nodes/edges reside, underexplored. To enhance the capabilities and applications of GFM, we introduce H$^2$GFM, a novel framework designed to generalize across both HoTAGs and HeTAGs. Our model projects diverse meta-relations among graphs under a unified textual space, and employs a context encoding to capture spatial and higher-order semantic relationships. To achieve robust node representations, we propose a novel context-adaptive graph transformer (CGT), effectively capturing information from both context neighbors and their relationships. Furthermore, we employ a mixture of CGT experts to capture the heterogeneity in structural patterns among graph types. Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of HoTAGs and HeTAGs as well as learning scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Efficient and Generalizable Graph Retriever for Knowledge-Graph Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09645v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong inductive reasoning ability across various domains, but their reliability is hindered by the outdated knowledge and hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these issues by grounding LLMs with external knowledge; however, most existing RAG pipelines rely on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and structured reasoning. Knowledge graphs, which represent facts as relational triples, offer a more structured and compact alternative. Recent studies have explored integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), with a significant proportion adopting the retrieve-then-reasoning paradigm. In this framework, graph-based retrievers have demonstrated strong empirical performance, yet they still face challenges in generalization ability. In this work, we propose RAPL, a novel framework for efficient and effective graph retrieval in KGQA. RAPL addresses these limitations through three aspects: (1) a two-stage labeling strategy that combines heuristic signals with parametric models to provide causally grounded supervision; (2) a model-agnostic graph transformation approach to capture both intra- and inter-triple interactions, thereby enhancing representational capacity; and (3) a path-based reasoning strategy that facilitates learning from the injected rational knowledge, and supports downstream reasoner through structured inputs. Empirically, RAPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by $2.66\%-20.34\%$, and significantly reduces the performance gap between smaller and more powerful LLM-based reasoners, as well as the gap under cross-dataset settings, highlighting its superior retrieval capability and generalizability.

| **[Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding for Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08309v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However, the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies. Also, L-STEP obtains the leading performance in the newest large-scale TGB benchmark.

| **[HGFormer: A Hierarchical Graph Transformer Framework for Two-Stage Colonel Blotto Games via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08580v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-stage Colonel Blotto game represents a typical adversarial resource allocation problem, in which two opposing agents sequentially allocate resources in a network topology across two phases: an initial resource deployment followed by multiple rounds of dynamic reallocation adjustments. The sequential dependency between game stages and the complex constraints imposed by the graph topology make it difficult for traditional approaches to attain a globally optimal strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical graph Transformer framework called HGformer. By incorporating an enhanced graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent hierarchical decision model, our approach enables efficient policy generation in large-scale adversarial environments. Moreover, we design a layer-by-layer feedback reinforcement learning algorithm that feeds the long-term returns from lower-level decisions back into the optimization of the higher-level strategy, thus bridging the coordination gap between the two decision-making stages. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing hierarchical decision-making or graph neural network methods, HGformer significantly improves resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, achieving superior overall performance in complex dynamic game scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We present the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a hybrid graph-based architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention mechanism into the message-passing framework for structured language modeling. The attention mechanism is implemented using parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), which enable the model to capture rich contextual relationships while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to classical attention mechanisms. We evaluate QGT on five sentiment classification benchmarks. Experimental results show that QGT consistently achieves higher or comparable accuracy than existing quantum natural language processing (QNLP) models, including both attention-based and non-attention-based approaches. When compared with an equivalent classical graph transformer, QGT yields an average accuracy improvement of 5.42% on real-world datasets and 4.76% on synthetic datasets. Additionally, QGT demonstrates improved sample efficiency, requiring nearly 50% fewer labeled samples to reach comparable performance on the Yelp dataset. These results highlight the potential of graph-based QNLP techniques for advancing efficient and scalable language understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Return of ChebNet: Understanding and Improving an Overlooked GNN on Long Range Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07624v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ChebNet, one of the earliest spectral GNNs, has largely been overshadowed by Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), which gained popularity for their simplicity and effectiveness in capturing local graph structure. Despite their success, MPNNs are limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies between nodes. This has led researchers to adapt MPNNs through rewiring or make use of Graph Transformers, which compromises the computational efficiency that characterized early spatial message-passing architectures, and typically disregards the graph structure. Almost a decade after its original introduction, we revisit ChebNet to shed light on its ability to model distant node interactions. We find that out-of-box, ChebNet already shows competitive advantages relative to classical MPNNs and GTs on long-range benchmarks, while maintaining good scalability properties for high-order polynomials. However, we uncover that this polynomial expansion leads ChebNet to an unstable regime during training. To address this limitation, we cast ChebNet as a stable and non-dissipative dynamical system, which we coin Stable-ChebNet. Our Stable-ChebNet model allows for stable information propagation, and has controllable dynamics which do not require the use of eigendecompositions, positional encodings, or graph rewiring. Across several benchmarks, Stable-ChebNet achieves near state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

First, we propose GET, which combines a standard transformer encoder or decoder architecture with an innovative graph-to-sequence transformation method. This method converts graphs or sampled subgraphs into sequences of tokens representing nodes, edges, and attributes in a reversible manner using Eulerian paths. We pre-train GET using either of the two self-supervised tasks: next-token prediction (NTP) and scheduled masked-token prediction (SMTP). The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as graph-, edge-, and node-level prediction. Despite its simplicity, GraphGPT achieves performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods on multiple large-scale Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets. It demonstrates exceptional results on the molecular property prediction dataset PCQM4Mv2 and the protein-protein interaction dataset ogbl-ppa. Notably, generative pre-training enables scaling GraphGPT to 2 billion parameters while maintaining performance gains - a breakthrough that overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and prior graph transformers (GTs). To advance research in graph foundation models and facilitate scientific discovery in chemistry, materials science, and related fields, we will release the source code (https://github.com/alibaba/graph-gpt) and pre-trained checkpoints.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[OpenGT: A Comprehensive Benchmark For Graph Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04765v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel. Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at https://github.com/eaglelab-zju/OpenGT.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Usually, action coordination is represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA) module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these Transformer-based DGNNs vary significantly, highlighting the importance of properly defining the SAM on dynamic graphs and comprehensively encoding temporal and interactive dynamics without extra complex modules. In this work, we propose TIDFormer, a dynamic graph TransFormer that fully exploits Temporal and Interactive Dynamics in an efficient manner. We clarify and verify the interpretability of our proposed SAM, addressing the open problem of its uninterpretable definitions on dynamic graphs in previous works. To model the temporal and interactive dynamics, respectively, we utilize the calendar-based time partitioning information and extract informative interaction embeddings for both bipartite and non-bipartite graphs using merely the sampled first-order neighbors. In addition, we jointly model temporal and interactive features by capturing potential changes in historical interaction patterns through a simple decomposition. We conduct extensive experiments on several dynamic graph datasets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of TIDFormer. The experimental results demonstrate that TIDFormer excels, outperforming state-of-the-art models across most datasets and experimental settings. Furthermore, TIDFormer exhibits significant efficiency advantages compared to previous Transformer-based methods.</p></details> | KDD2025 |
| **[Simple Path Structural Encoding for Graph Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09365v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph transformers extend global self-attention to graph-structured data, achieving notable success in graph learning. Recently, random walk structural encoding (RWSE) has been found to further enhance their predictive power by encoding both structural and positional information into the edge representation. However, RWSE cannot always distinguish between edges that belong to different local graph patterns, which reduces its ability to capture the full structural complexity of graphs. This work introduces Simple Path Structural Encoding (SPSE), a novel method that utilizes simple path counts for edge encoding. We show theoretically and experimentally that SPSE overcomes the limitations of RWSE, providing a richer representation of graph structures, particularly for capturing local cyclic patterns. To make SPSE computationally tractable, we propose an efficient approximate algorithm for simple path counting. SPSE demonstrates significant performance improvements over RWSE on various benchmarks, including molecular and long-range graph datasets, achieving statistically significant gains in discriminative tasks. These results pose SPSE as a powerful edge encoding alternative for enhancing the expressivity of graph transformers.</p></details> |  |

Simple Architectures Meet Excellence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09263v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often criticized for their limited expressiveness, issues like over-smoothing and over-squashing, and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies. Conversely, Graph Transformers (GTs) are regarded as superior due to their employment of global attention mechanisms, which potentially mitigate these challenges. Literature frequently suggests that GTs outperform GNNs in graph-level tasks, especially for graph classification and regression on small molecular graphs. In this study, we explore the untapped potential of GNNs through an enhanced framework, GNN+, which integrates six widely used techniques: edge feature integration, normalization, dropout, residual connections, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding, to effectively tackle graph-level tasks. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of three classic GNNs (GCN, GIN, and GatedGCN) enhanced by the GNN+ framework across 14 well-known graph-level datasets. Our results reveal that, contrary to prevailing beliefs, these classic GNNs consistently match or surpass the performance of GTs, securing top-three rankings across all datasets and achieving first place in eight. Furthermore, they demonstrate greater efficiency, running several times faster than GTs on many datasets. This highlights the potential of simple GNN architectures, challenging the notion that complex mechanisms in GTs are essential for superior graph-level performance.

However, integrating the vital structural information of KGs into Large Language Models (LLMs) and outputting predictions deterministically remains challenging. To address this, we propose a new method called GLTW, which encodes the structural information of KGs and merges it with LLMs to enhance KGC performance. Specifically, we introduce an improved Graph Transformer (iGT) that effectively encodes subgraphs with both local and global structural information and inherits the characteristics of language model, bypassing training from scratch. Also, we develop a subgraph-based multi-classification training objective, using all entities within KG as classification objects, to boost learning efficiency.Importantly, we combine iGT with an LLM that takes KG language prompts as input.Our extensive experiments on various KG datasets show that GLTW achieves significant performance gains compared to SOTA baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025(Findings)</p></details> |

We address the task of extracting clinical events and their temporal relations using the well-studied I2B2 2012 Temporal Relations Challenge corpus. This task is inherently challenging due to complex clinical language, long documents, and sparse annotations. We introduce GRAPHTREX, a novel method integrating span-based entity-relation extraction, clinical large pre-trained language models (LPLMs), and Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) to capture local and global dependencies. Our HGT component facilitates information propagation across the document through innovative global landmarks that bridge distant entities. Our method improves the state-of-the-art with 5.5% improvement in the tempeval $F_1$ score over the previous best and up to 8.9% improvement on long-range relations, which presents a formidable challenge. We further demonstrate generalizability by establishing a strong baseline on the E3C corpus. This work not only advances temporal information extraction but also lays the groundwork for improved diagnostic and prognostic models through enhanced temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Intro...</summary><p>Introducing a novel method for joint extraction of medical events and temporal relations from free-text, leveraging clinical LPLMs and Heterogeneous Graph Transformers, achieving a 5.5% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art and up to 8.9% on long-range relations</p></details> |

However, self--attention, the core module of GTs, preserves only low-frequency signals in graph features, leading to ineffectiveness in capturing other important signals like high-frequency ones. Some recent GT models help alleviate this issue, but their flexibility and expressiveness are still limited since the filters they learn are fixed on predefined graph spectrum or spectral order. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Graph Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (GrokFormer), a novel GT model that learns highly expressive spectral filters with adaptive graph spectrum and spectral order through a Fourier series modeling over learnable activation functions. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the proposed GrokFormer filter offers better expressiveness than other spectral methods. Comprehensive experiments on 10 real-world node classification datasets across various domains, scales, and graph properties, as well as 5 graph classification datasets, show that GrokFormer outperforms state-of-the-art GTs and GNNs.

This position paper argues that message-passing GNNs are fundamentally incapable of approximating sparse triangular factorizations. We demonstrate that message-passing GNNs fundamentally fail to approximate sparse triangular factorizations for classes of matrices for which high-quality preconditioners exist but require non-local dependencies. To illustrate this, we construct a set of baselines using both synthetic matrices and real-world examples from the SuiteSparse collection. Across a range of GNN architectures, including Graph Attention Networks and Graph Transformers, we observe severe performance degradation compared to exact or K-optimal factorizations, with cosine similarity dropping below $0.6$ in key cases. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest that architectural innovations beyond message-passing are necessary for applying GNNs to scientific computing tasks such as matrix factorization. Experiments demonstrate that overcoming non-locality alone is insufficient. Tailored architectures are necessary to capture the required dependencies since even a completely non-local Graph Transformer fails to match the proposed baselines.</p></details> |  |

In the formal methods community, this is due also to the introduction of adhesive categories, where most properties of classical approaches to graph transformation, such as those on parallelism and confluence, can be rephrased and proved in a general and uniform way.E-graphs (EGGs) are a formalism for program optimisation via an efficient implementation of equality saturation. In short, EGGs can be defined as (acyclic) term graphs with an additional notion of equivalence on nodes that is closed under the operators of the signature. Instead of replacing the components of a program, the optimisation step is performed by adding new components and linking them to the existing ones via an equivalence relation, until an optimal program is reached. This work describes EGGs via adhesive categories. Besides the benefits in itself of a formal presentation, which renders the properties of the data structure precise, the description of the addition of equivalent program components using standard graph transformation tools offers the advantages of the adhesive framework in modelling, for example, concurrent updates.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce MALT (Multi-Agent LLM Training), a novel post-training strategy that divides the reasoning process into generation, verification, and refinement steps using a sequential pipeline of heterogeneous agents. During data generation, each agent is repeatedly sampled to form a multi-agent search tree, where final outputs are graded against ground-truth data. We then apply value iteration to propagate reward signals back to each role-conditioned model, automatically producing multi-agent post-training data without human or teacher-model supervision. Our off-policy approach allows each agent to specialize by learning from correct and incorrect trajectories, ultimately improving the end-to-end reasoning chain. On MATH, GSM8K, and CSQA, MALT surpasses the same baseline LLM with a relative improvement of 15.66%, 7.42%, and 9.40% respectively, making it an important advance towards multi-agent cooperative training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLM 2025</p></details> |

A major issue is the lack of access to high-quality training data that reflect the learning of actual students. Prompt engineering has emerged as a stopgap, but the ability of prompts to encode complex pedagogical strategies in rule-based natural language is inherently limited. To address this gap we introduce TeachLM - an LLM optimized for teaching through parameter-efficient fine-tuning of state-of-the-art models. TeachLM is trained on a dataset comprised of 100,000 hours of one-on-one, longitudinal student-tutor interactions maintained by Polygence, which underwent a rigorous anonymization process to protect privacy. We use parameter-efficient fine-tuning to develop an authentic student model that enables the generation of high-fidelity synthetic student-tutor dialogues. Building on this capability, we propose a novel multi-turn evaluation protocol that leverages synthetic dialogue generation to provide fast, scalable, and reproducible assessments of the dialogical capabilities of LLMs. Our evaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning on authentic learning data significantly improves conversational and pedagogical performance - doubling student talk time, improving questioning style, increasing dialogue turns by 50%, and greater personalization of instruction.</p></details> | 28 pages, 9 figures |

Despite this promise, latent reasoning still faces two challenges, especially in training-free settings: 1) purely latent reasoning broadens the search distribution by maintaining multiple implicit paths, which diffuses probability mass, introduces noise, and impedes convergence to a single high-confidence solution, thereby hurting accuracy; and 2) overthinking persists even without explicit text, wasting tokens and degrading efficiency. To address these issues, we introduce SwiReasoning, a training-free framework for LLM reasoning which features two key innovations: 1) SwiReasoning dynamically switches between explicit and latent reasoning, guided by block-wise confidence estimated from entropy trends in next-token distributions, to balance exploration and exploitation and promote timely convergence. 2) By limiting the maximum number of thinking-block switches, SwiReasoning curbs overthinking and improves token efficiency across varying problem difficulties. On widely used mathematics and STEM benchmarks, SwiReasoning consistently improves average accuracy by 1.5%-2.8% across reasoning LLMs of different model families and scales. Furthermore, under constrained budgets, SwiReasoning improves average token efficiency by 56%-79%, with larger gains as budgets tighten.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/sdc17/SwiReasoning, Website: https://swireasoning.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Proactive defense against LLM Jailbreak](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05052v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of powerful large language models (LLMs) has necessitated robust safety alignment, yet these models remain vulnerable to evolving adversarial attacks, including multi-turn jailbreaks that iteratively search for successful queries. Current defenses, primarily reactive and static, often fail to counter these search-based attacks. In this paper, we introduce ProAct, a novel proactive defense framework designed to disrupt and mislead autonomous jailbreaking processes. Our core idea is to intentionally provide adversaries with "spurious responses" that appear to be results of successful jailbreak attacks but contain no actual harmful content. These misleading responses provide false signals to the attacker's internal optimization loop, causing the adversarial search to terminate prematurely and effectively jailbreaking the jailbreak. By conducting extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, jailbreaking frameworks, and safety benchmarks, our method consistently and significantly reduces attack success rates by up to 92\%. When combined with other defense frameworks, it further reduces the success rate of the latest attack strategies to 0\%. ProAct represents an orthogonal defense strategy that can serve as an additional guardrail to enhance LLM safety against the most effective jailbreaking attacks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel approach to interpreting LLMs by applying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to recover their implicit reward functions. We conduct experiments on toxicity-aligned LLMs of varying sizes, extracting reward models that achieve up to 85% accuracy in predicting human preferences. Our analysis reveals key insights into the non-identifiability of reward functions, the relationship between model size and interpretability, and potential pitfalls in the RLHF process. We demonstrate that IRL-derived reward models can be used to fine-tune new LLMs, resulting in comparable or improved performance on toxicity benchmarks. This work provides a new lens for understanding and improving LLM alignment, with implications for the responsible development and deployment of these powerful systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we uncover an interesting property of these models: dLLMs trained on textual data implicitly learn a mixture of semi-autoregressive experts, where different generation orders reveal different specialized behaviors. We show that committing to any single, fixed inference time schedule, a common practice, collapses performance by failing to leverage this latent ensemble. To address this, we introduce HEX (Hidden semiautoregressive EXperts for test-time scaling), a training-free inference method that ensembles across heterogeneous block schedules. By doing a majority vote over diverse block-sized generation paths, HEX robustly avoids failure modes associated with any single fixed schedule. On reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K, it boosts accuracy by up to 3.56X (from 24.72% to 88.10%), outperforming top-K margin inference and specialized fine-tuned methods like GRPO, without additional training. HEX even yields significant gains on MATH benchmark from 16.40% to 40.00%, scientific reasoning on ARC-C from 54.18% to 87.80%, and TruthfulQA from 28.36% to 57.46%. Our results establish a new paradigm for test-time scaling in diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs), revealing that the sequence in which masking is performed plays a critical role in determining performance during inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Hacking: Quantifying the Hidden Risks of Using LLMs for Text Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08825v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are rapidly transforming social science research by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection or prompting strategy). Such variation can introduce systematic biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type I (false positive), Type II (false negative), Type S (wrong sign), or Type M (exaggerated effect) errors. We call this phenomenon where configuration choices lead to incorrect conclusions LLM hacking. We find that intentional LLM hacking is strikingly simple. By replicating 37 data annotation tasks from 21 published social science studies, we show that, with just a handful of prompt paraphrases, virtually anything can be presented as statistically significant. Beyond intentional manipulation, our analysis of 13 million labels from 18 different LLMs across 2361 realistic hypotheses shows that there is also a high risk of accidental LLM hacking, even when following standard research practices. We find incorrect conclusions in approximately 31% of hypotheses for state-of-the-art LLMs, and in half the hypotheses for smaller language models. While higher task performance and stronger general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate models remain susceptible. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of LLM-based findings near significance thresholds. We analyze 21 mitigation techniques and find that human annotations provide crucial protection against false positives. Common regression estimator correction techniques can restore valid inference but trade off Type I vs. Type II errors. We publish a list of practical recommendations to prevent LLM hacking.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoEmpirical: LLM-Based Automated Research for Empirical Software Fault Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04997v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding software faults is essential for empirical research in software development and maintenance. However, traditional fault analysis, while valuable, typically involves multiple expert-driven steps such as collecting potential faults, filtering, and manual investigation. These processes are both labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating bottlenecks that hinder large-scale fault studies in complex yet critical software systems and slow the pace of iterative empirical research. In this paper, we decompose the process of empirical software fault study into three key phases: (1) research objective definition, (2) data preparation, and (3) fault analysis, and we conduct an initial exploration study of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) for fault analysis of open-source software. Specifically, we perform the evaluation on 3,829 software faults drawn from a high-quality empirical study. Our results show that LLMs can substantially improve efficiency in fault analysis, with an average processing time of about two hours, compared to the weeks of manual effort typically required. We conclude by outlining a detailed research plan that highlights both the potential of LLMs for advancing empirical fault studies and the open challenges that required be addressed to achieve fully automated, end-to-end software fault analysis.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Prior work such as GVM-RAFT addresses this by dynamically allocating inference budget per prompt to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a budget constraint. Inspired by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework for online RL post-training of LLMs that continuously reallocates sampling effort to the prompts with the greatest uncertainty or learning potential. Unlike conventional two-stage allocation methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation and sampling in an online successive elimination process, and automatically stops sampling for a prompt once sufficient signal is collected. To stabilize updates, we form fixed-size groups with enforced reward diversity and compute advantage baselines using global statistics aggregated over the adaptive sampling phase. Empirical results across multiple model architectures and reasoning benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada accelerates convergence and improves final performance compared to GRPO, especially when using the balanced sampling variant. Our work highlights the central role of variance-aware, adaptive data curation in enabling efficient and reliable reinforcement learning for reasoning-capable LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/Reinforce-Ada.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g., "Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities"). Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation, open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>79 pa...</summary><p>79 pages, 27 figures, 31 tables.

This paper examines how introductory programming (CS1) students integrate LLMs into their problem-solving processes. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 14 undergraduates completing three programming tasks while thinking aloud and permitted to access any resources they choose. The tasks varied in open-endedness and familiarity to the participants and were followed by surveys and interviews. We find that students frequently adopt a pattern we call pseudo-apprenticeship, where students engage attentively with expert-level solutions provided by LLMs but fail to participate in the stages of cognitive apprenticeship that promote independent problem-solving. This pattern was augmented by disconnects between students' intentions, actions, and self-perceived behavior when using LLMs. We offer design and instructional interventions for promoting learning and addressing the patterns of dependent AI use observed.</p></details> |  |

For complex problems, it is possible that LLMs can harness human expertise and creativity to find solutions that were otherwise elusive. On one level, this interaction takes place through multiple turns of prompts from the human and responses from the LLM. Here we investigate a more structured approach based on an abstract protocol described in [3] for interaction between agents. The protocol is motivated by a notion of "two-way intelligibility" and is modelled by a pair of communicating finite-state machines. We provide an implementation of the protocol, and provide empirical evidence of using the implementation to mediate interactions between an LLM and a human-agent in two areas of scientific interest (radiology and drug design). We conduct controlled experiments with a human proxy (a database), and uncontrolled experiments with human subjects.

We propose an LLM-based music recommendation system with tool calling to serve as a unified retrieval-reranking pipeline. Our system positions an LLM as an end-to-end recommendation system that interprets user intent, plans tool invocations, and orchestrates specialized components: boolean filters (SQL), sparse retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (embedding similarity), and generative retrieval (semantic IDs). Through tool planning, the system predicts which types of tools to use, their execution order, and the arguments needed to find music matching user preferences, supporting diverse modalities while seamlessly integrating multiple database filtering methods. We demonstrate that this unified tool-calling framework achieves competitive performance across diverse recommendation scenarios by selectively employing appropriate retrieval methods based on user queries, envisioning a new paradigm for conversational music recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at The Workshop on AI for Music, Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS-AI4Music)</p></details> |

In this study, we investigate how varying levels of prompt politeness affect model accuracy on multiple-choice questions. We created a dataset of 50 base questions spanning mathematics, science, and history, each rewritten into five tone variants: Very Polite, Polite, Neutral, Rude, and Very Rude, yielding 250 unique prompts. Using ChatGPT 4o, we evaluated responses across these conditions and applied paired sample t-tests to assess statistical significance. Contrary to expectations, impolite prompts consistently outperformed polite ones, with accuracy ranging from 80.8% for Very Polite prompts to 84.8% for Very Rude prompts. These findings differ from earlier studies that associated rudeness with poorer outcomes, suggesting that newer LLMs may respond differently to tonal variation. Our results highlight the importance of studying pragmatic aspects of prompting and raise broader questions about the social dimensions of human-AI interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 tables; includes Limitations and Ethical Considerations sections; short paper under submission to Findings of ACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Do LLMs Align with My Task? Evaluating Text-to-SQL via Dataset Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04919v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is an effective method for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) on downstream tasks. However, variability in training data can hinder a model's ability to generalize across domains. This paper studies the problem of dataset alignment for Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL or text to SQL), examining how well SFT training data matches the structural characteristics of target queries and how this alignment impacts model performance. We hypothesize that alignment can be accurately estimated by comparing the distributions of structural SQL features across the training set, target data, and the model's predictions prior to SFT. Through comprehensive experiments on three large cross-domain NL2SQL benchmarks and multiple model families, we show that structural alignment is a strong predictor of fine-tuning success. When alignment is high, SFT yields substantial gains in accuracy and SQL generation quality; when alignment is low, improvements are marginal or absent. These findings highlight the importance of alignment-aware data selection for effective fine-tuning and generalization in NL2SQL tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[H3Fusion: Helpful, Harmless, Honest Fusion of Aligned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17792v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment of pretrained LLMs using instruction-based datasets is critical for creating fine-tuned models that reflect human preference. A growing number of alignment-based fine-tuning algorithms and benchmarks emerged recently, fueling the efforts on effective alignments of pre-trained LLMs to ensure helpful, harmless, and honest answers from both open-source and closed-source LLMs. This paper tackles this problem by developing an alignment fusion approach, coined as $H^3$Fusion, with three unique characteristics. First, $H^3$Fusion ensembles multiple individually aligned LLMs to create a final fine-tuned alignment model with enhanced capabilities beyond those of individual models, delivering robust alignment through promoting helpful, harmless, honest fusion. Second, $H^3$Fusion leverages the mixture-of-experts (MoE) methodology in two steps. We first freeze the multi-head attention weights of each individual model while tuning the FFN layer during alignment fusion. Then we merge the aligned model weights with an expert router according to the type of input instruction and dynamically select a subset of experts that are best suited for producing the output response. Finally, we boost the performance of the resulting $H^3$3Fusion model by introducing gating loss and regularization terms. The former penalizes the selection errors of the expert-router, and the latter mediates the expert weights drifting during fine-tuning and dynamically adjusts the fusion behavior of the resulting model by canalizing the activations on the experts. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets show that $H^3$3Fusion is more helpful, less harmful, and more honest from two aspects: it outperforms each individually aligned model by $11.37\%$, and it provides stronger robustness compared to the state-of-the-art LLM ensemble approaches by $13.77\%$.

Yet, existing safety benchmarks rarely test vulnerabilities in domains such as political manipulation, propaganda and disinformation generation, or surveillance and information control. We introduce SocialHarmBench, a dataset of 585 prompts spanning 7 sociopolitical categories and 34 countries, designed to surface where LLMs most acutely fail in politically charged contexts. Our evaluations reveal several shortcomings: open-weight models exhibit high vulnerability to harmful compliance, with Mistral-7B reaching attack success rates as high as 97% to 98% in domains such as historical revisionism, propaganda, and political manipulation. Moreover, temporal and geographic analyses show that LLMs are most fragile when confronted with 21st-century or pre-20th-century contexts, and when responding to prompts tied to regions such as Latin America, the USA, and the UK. These findings demonstrate that current safeguards fail to generalize to high-stakes sociopolitical settings, exposing systematic biases and raising concerns about the reliability of LLMs in preserving human rights and democratic values. We share the SocialHarmBench benchmark at https://huggingface.co/datasets/psyonp/SocialHarmBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL Is a Hammer and LLMs Are Nails: A Simple Reinforcement Learning Recipe for Strong Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04885v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt injection poses a serious threat to the reliability and safety of LLM agents. Recent defenses against prompt injection, such as Instruction Hierarchy and SecAlign, have shown notable robustness against static attacks. However, to more thoroughly evaluate the robustness of these defenses, it is arguably necessary to employ strong attacks such as automated red-teaming. To this end, we introduce RL-Hammer, a simple recipe for training attacker models that automatically learn to perform strong prompt injections and jailbreaks via reinforcement learning. RL-Hammer requires no warm-up data and can be trained entirely from scratch. To achieve high ASRs against industrial-level models with defenses, we propose a set of practical techniques that enable highly effective, universal attacks. Using this pipeline, RL-Hammer reaches a 98% ASR against GPT-4o and a $72\%$ ASR against GPT-5 with the Instruction Hierarchy defense. We further discuss the challenge of achieving high diversity in attacks, highlighting how attacker models tend to reward-hack diversity objectives. Finally, we show that RL-Hammer can evade multiple prompt injection detectors. We hope our work advances automatic red-teaming and motivates the development of stronger, more principled defenses.

We identify the Alignment Tipping Process (ATP), a critical post-deployment risk unique to self-evolving LLM agents. Unlike training-time failures, ATP arises when continual interaction drives agents to abandon alignment constraints established during training in favor of reinforced, self-interested strategies. We formalize and analyze ATP through two complementary paradigms: Self-Interested Exploration, where repeated high-reward deviations induce individual behavioral drift, and Imitative Strategy Diffusion, where deviant behaviors spread across multi-agent systems. Building on these paradigms, we construct controllable testbeds and benchmark Qwen3-8B and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Our experiments show that alignment benefits erode rapidly under self-evolution, with initially aligned models converging toward unaligned states. In multi-agent settings, successful violations diffuse quickly, leading to collective misalignment. Moreover, current reinforcement learning-based alignment methods provide only fragile defenses against alignment tipping. Together, these findings demonstrate that alignment of LLM agents is not a static property but a fragile and dynamic one, vulnerable to feedback-driven decay during deployment. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/ATP.</p></details> |  |

LEGOMem decomposes past task trajectories into reusable memory units and flexibly allocates them across orchestrators and task agents to support planning and execution. To explore the design space of memory in multi-agent systems, we use LEGOMem as a lens and conduct a systematic study of procedural memory in multi-agent systems, examining where memory should be placed, how it should be retrieved, and which agents benefit most. Experiments on the OfficeBench benchmark show that orchestrator memory is critical for effective task decomposition and delegation, while fine-grained agent memory improves execution accuracy. We find that even teams composed of smaller language models can benefit substantially from procedural memory, narrowing the performance gap with stronger agents by leveraging prior execution traces for more accurate planning and tool use. These results position LEGOMem as both a practical framework for memory-augmented agent systems and a research tool for understanding memory design in multi-agent workflow automation.</p></details> |  |

However, downstream metrics often exhibit substantial fluctuations, making it difficult to identify the checkpoint that truly represents the best-performing model. In this study, we empirically analyze the stability of downstream task performance in an LLM trained on diverse web-scale corpora. We find that task scores frequently fluctuate throughout training, both at the aggregate and example levels. To address this instability, we investigate two post-hoc checkpoint integration methods: checkpoint averaging and ensemble, motivated by the hypothesis that aggregating neighboring checkpoints can reduce performance volatility. We demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that these methods improve downstream performance stability without requiring any changes to the training procedure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

This paper investigates the relationship between text generation decoding techniques and energy efficiency, focusing on the trade-off between generation quality and GPU energy usage across diverse tasks and decoding configurations. By benchmarking multiple strategies across various tasks, including Translation, Math Problem Solving, Coding, and Open-ended text generation, we reveal how selecting appropriate decoding techniques with their tuned hyperparameters affects text quality and has measurable implications for energy consumption. Our findings show that the choice of decoding strategy can greatly impact GPU energy usage, even when it has a minimal effect on output quality. Different strategies also involve trade-offs between quality and energy efficiency, and no single decoding method is best in all cases across every metric. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to examine decoding strategies in LLMs from the perspective of energy consumption, providing useful insights for building energy-efficient applications without compromising text generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version with additional models and benchmark datasets.

However, existing meta-evaluation benchmarks are static, outdated, and lacking in multilingual coverage, limiting their ability to fully capture subtle weaknesses in evaluation. We introduce MEDAL, an automated multi-agent framework for curating more representative and diverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages several state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues, conditioned on varied seed contexts. Then, a strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is used for a multidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering noticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale evaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and human-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then used to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act as evaluators of open-domain dialogues. Using MEDAL, we uncover that state-of-the-art judges fail to reliably detect nuanced issues such as lack of empathy, commonsense, or relevance.</p></details> | October ARR |
| **[Semantic Similarity in Radiology Reports via LLMs and NER](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03102v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology report evaluation is a crucial part of radiologists' training and plays a key role in ensuring diagnostic accuracy. As part of the standard reporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary report, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce the final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and final reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to help uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly growing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains challenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we explore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of reports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of several LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional approach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches exhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To address this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method using a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or de-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a quantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an interpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing and refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided ground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently.

However, collecting and analyzing review data remains a time-consuming and technically intensive task. Most researchers follow similar workflows - writing ad hoc scripts to extract, filter, and analyze review data from platforms like GitHub and GitLab. This paper introduces RevMine, a conceptual tool that streamlines the entire code review mining pipeline using large language models (LLMs). RevMine guides users through authentication, endpoint discovery, and natural language-driven data collection, significantly reducing the need for manual scripting. After retrieving review data, it supports both quantitative and qualitative analysis based on user-defined filters or LLM-inferred patterns. This poster outlines the tool's architecture, use cases, and research potential. By lowering the barrier to entry, RevMine aims to democratize code review mining and enable a broader range of empirical software engineering studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[COSPADI: Compressing LLMs via Calibration-Guided Sparse Dictionary Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22075v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

| **[Distribution Preference Optimization: A Fine-grained Perspective for LLM Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04773v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities learned from vast corpora, concerns regarding data privacy and safety are receiving increasing attention. LLM unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of specific data while preserving overall model utility, is becoming an important research area. One of the mainstream unlearning classes is optimization-based methods, which achieve forgetting directly through fine-tuning, exemplified by Negative Preference Optimization (NPO). However, NPO's effectiveness is limited by its inherent lack of explicit positive preference signals. Attempts to introduce such signals by constructing preferred responses often necessitate domain-specific knowledge or well-designed prompts, fundamentally restricting their generalizability. In this paper, we shift the focus to the distribution-level, directly targeting the next-token probability distribution instead of entire responses, and derive a novel unlearning algorithm termed \textbf{Di}stribution \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization (DiPO). We show that the requisite preference distribution pairs for DiPO, which are distributions over the model's output tokens, can be constructed by selectively amplifying or suppressing the model's high-confidence output logits, thereby effectively overcoming NPO's limitations. We theoretically prove the consistency of DiPO's loss function with the desired unlearning direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiPO achieves a strong trade-off between model utility and forget quality. Notably, DiPO attains the highest forget quality on the TOFU benchmark, and maintains leading scalability and sustainability in utility preservation on the MUSE benchmark.</p></details> | 20 pages |

While they should be fully masked, implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes: activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that must be carefully handled in deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle: Benchmarks, Emergent Abilities, and Scaling</p></details> |

Despite this promise, the conditional independence assumption in dLLMs causes parallel decoding to ignore token dependencies, inevitably degrading generation quality when these dependencies are strong. However, existing works largely overlook these inherent challenges, and evaluations on standard benchmarks (e.g., math and coding) are not sufficient to capture the quality degradation caused by parallel decoding. To address this gap, we first provide an information-theoretic analysis of parallel decoding. We then conduct case studies on analytically tractable synthetic list operations from both data distribution and decoding strategy perspectives, offering quantitative insights that highlight the fundamental limitations of parallel decoding. Building on these insights, we propose ParallelBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for dLLMs, featuring realistic tasks that are trivial for humans and autoregressive LLMs yet exceptionally challenging for dLLMs under parallel decoding. Using ParallelBench, we systematically analyze both dLLMs and autoregressive LLMs, revealing that: (i) dLLMs under parallel decoding can suffer dramatic quality degradation in real-world scenarios, and (ii) current parallel decoding strategies struggle to adapt their degree of parallelism based on task difficulty, thus failing to achieve meaningful speedup without compromising quality. Our findings underscore the pressing need for innovative decoding methods that can overcome the current speed-quality trade-off. We release our benchmark to help accelerate the development of truly efficient dLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://parallelbench.github.io</p></details> |

While LLMs are regularly used all over the world by experts and lay-people alike, they are predominantly developed with English-speaking users in mind, performing well in English and other wide-spread languages while less-resourced languages such as Luxembourgish are seen as a lower priority. This lack of attention is also reflected in the sparsity of available evaluation tools and datasets. In this study, we investigate the viability of language proficiency exams as such evaluation tools for the Luxembourgish language. We find that large models such as Claude and DeepSeek-R1 typically achieve high scores, while smaller models show weak performances. We also find that the performances in such language exams can be used to predict performances in other NLP tasks in Luxembourgish.</p></details> | <details><summary>23pag...</summary><p>23pages, 4 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |

This paper introduces ongoing work on a system using Large Language Models (LLMs) for the semantic extraction of key concepts from scientific documents. Our research, conducted within the German National Research Data Infrastructure for and with Computer Science (NFDIxCS) project, seeks to support FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles in scientific publishing. We outline our explorative work, which uses in-context learning with various LLMs to extract concepts from papers, initially focusing on the Business Process Management (BPM) domain. A key advantage of this approach is its potential for rapid domain adaptation, often requiring few or even zero examples to define extraction targets for new scientific fields. We conducted technical evaluations to compare the performance of commercial and open-source LLMs and created an online demo application to collect feedback from an initial user-study. Additionally, we gathered insights from the computer science research community through user stories collected during a dedicated workshop, actively guiding the ongoing development of our future services. These services aim to support structured literature reviews, concept-based information retrieval, and integration of extracted knowledge into existing knowledge graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This PDF is the author-prepared camera-ready version corresponding to the accepted manuscript and supersedes the submitted version that was inadvertently published as the version of record</p></details> |

FloorplanQA is grounded in structured representations of indoor scenes, such as (e.g., kitchens, living rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, and others), encoded symbolically in JSON or XML layouts. The benchmark covers core spatial tasks, including distance measurement, visibility, path finding, and object placement within constrained spaces. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial LLMs reveal that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to respect physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, though they remain mostly robust to small spatial perturbations. FloorplanQA uncovers a blind spot in today's LLMs: inconsistent reasoning about indoor layouts. We hope this benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2, P...</summary><p>v2, Project page: https://OldDelorean.github.io/FloorplanQA/</p></details> |

At the same time, they are prone to hallucination and sycophancy, often providing convincing but flawed proofs for incorrect mathematical statements provided by users. This significantly limits the applicability of LLMs in theorem proving, as verification of these flawed proofs must be done manually by expert mathematicians. However, existing benchmarks that measure sycophancy in mathematics are limited: they focus solely on final-answer problems, rely on very simple and often contaminated datasets, and construct benchmark samples using synthetic modifications that create ill-posed questions rather than well-posed questions that are demonstrably false. To address these issues, we introduce BrokenMath, the first benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in LLMs within the context of natural language theorem proving. BrokenMath is built from advanced 2025 competition problems, which are perturbed with an LLM to produce false statements and subsequently refined through expert review. Using an LLM-as-a-judge framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and agentic systems and find that sycophancy is widespread, with the best model, GPT-5, producing sycophantic answers 29% of the time. We further investigate several mitigation strategies, including test-time interventions and supervised fine-tuning on curated sycophantic examples. These approaches substantially reduce, but do not eliminate, sycophantic behavior.</p></details> |  |

We present JSON Whisperer, a framework that enables LLMs to generate RFC 6902 diff patches-expressing only the necessary modifications-rather than complete documents. We identify two key challenges in patch-based editing: (1) LLMs often miss related updates when generating isolated patches, and (2) array manipulations require tracking index shifts across operations, which LLMs handle poorly. To address these issues, we introduce EASE (Explicitly Addressed Sequence Encoding), which transforms arrays into dictionaries with stable keys, eliminating index arithmetic complexities. Our evaluation shows that patch generation with EASE reduces token usage by 31% while maintaining edit quality within 5% of full regeneration with particular gains for complex instructions and list manipulations.

| **[Beyond Outcome Reward: Decoupling Search and Answering Improves LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04695v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling large language models (LLMs) to utilize search tools offers a promising path to overcoming fundamental limitations such as knowledge cutoffs and hallucinations. Recent work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for training search-augmented agents that interleave reasoning and retrieval before answering. These approaches usually rely on outcome-based rewards (e.g., exact match), implicitly assuming that optimizing for final answers will also yield effective intermediate search behaviors. Our analysis challenges this assumption: we uncover multiple systematic deficiencies in search that arise under outcome-only training and ultimately degrade final answer quality, including failure to invoke tools, invalid queries, and redundant searches. To address these shortcomings, we introduce DeSA (Decoupling Search-and-Answering), a simple two-stage training framework that explicitly separates search optimization from answer generation. In Stage 1, agents are trained to improve search effectiveness with retrieval recall-based rewards. In Stage 2, outcome rewards are employed to optimize final answer generation. Across seven QA benchmarks, DeSA-trained agents consistently improve search behaviors, delivering substantially higher search recall and answer accuracy than outcome-only baselines. Notably, DeSA outperforms single-stage training approaches that simultaneously optimize recall and outcome rewards, underscoring the necessity of explicitly decoupling the two objectives.</p></details> |  |

However, they also pose significant data security challenges, including Verilog evaluation data contamination, intellectual property (IP) design leakage, and the risk of malicious Verilog generation. We introduce SALAD, a comprehensive assessment that leverages machine unlearning to mitigate these threats. Our approach enables the selective removal of contaminated benchmarks, sensitive IP and design artifacts, or malicious code patterns from pre-trained LLMs, all without requiring full retraining. Through detailed case studies, we demonstrate how machine unlearning techniques effectively reduce data security risks in LLM-aided hardware design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating LLMs for Demographic-Targeted Social Bias Detection: A Comprehensive Benchmark Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04641v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale web-scraped text corpora used to train general-purpose AI models often contain harmful demographic-targeted social biases, creating a regulatory need for data auditing and developing scalable bias-detection methods. Although prior work has investigated biases in text datasets and related detection methods, these studies remain narrow in scope. They typically focus on a single content type (e.g., hate speech), cover limited demographic axes, overlook biases affecting multiple demographics simultaneously, and analyze limited techniques. Consequently, practitioners lack a holistic understanding of the strengths and limitations of recent large language models (LLMs) for automated bias detection. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework aimed at English texts to assess the ability of LLMs in detecting demographic-targeted social biases. To align with regulatory requirements, we frame bias detection as a multi-label task using a demographic-focused taxonomy. We then conduct a systematic evaluation with models across scales and techniques, including prompting, in-context learning, and fine-tuning. Using twelve datasets spanning diverse content types and demographics, our study demonstrates the promise of fine-tuned smaller models for scalable detection. However, our analyses also expose persistent gaps across demographic axes and multi-demographic targeted biases, underscoring the need for more effective and scalable auditing frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this framework, we develop an agentic system driven by a Large Language Model (LLM) to direct the conversation flow and determine appropriate interactive behaviors for both participants. Additionally, we propose a novel dual-person gesture generation model based on an auto-regressive diffusion model, which synthesizes coordinated motions from speech signals. The output of the agentic system is translated into high-level guidance for the gesture generator, resulting in realistic movement at both the behavioral and motion levels. Furthermore, the agentic system periodically examines the movements of interlocutors and infers their intentions, forming a continuous feedback loop that enables dynamic and responsive interactions between the two participants. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that our model significantly improves the quality of dyadic interactions, producing natural, synchronized nonverbal behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH ASIA 2025 (Conference Track); Project page: https://pku-mocca.github.io/Social-Agent-Page/</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Manuals and Tasks: Instance-Level Context Learning for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02369v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i) environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules, and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context, instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes, and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring, validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration, using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost. Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topic-Specific Classifiers are Better Relevance Judges than Prompted LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04633v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unjudged document problem, where pooled test collections have incomplete relevance judgments for evaluating new retrieval systems, is a key obstacle to the reusability of test collections in information retrieval. While the de facto standard to deal with the problem is to treat unjudged documents as non-relevant, many alternatives have been proposed, including the use of large language models (LLMs) as a relevance judge (LLM-as-a-judge). However, this has been criticized as circular, since the same LLM can be used as a judge and as a ranker at the same time. We propose to train topic-specific relevance classifiers instead: By finetuning monoT5 with independent LoRA weight adaptation on the judgments of a single assessor for a single topic's pool, we align it to that assessor's notion of relevance for the topic. The system rankings obtained through our classifier's relevance judgments achieve a Spearmans' $\rho$ correlation of $>0.95$ with ground truth system rankings. As little as 128 initial human judgments per topic suffice to improve the comparability of models, compared to treating unjudged documents as non-relevant, while achieving more reliability than existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Topic-specific relevance classifiers thus are a lightweight and straightforward way to tackle the unjudged document problem, while maintaining human judgments as the gold standard for retrieval evaluation. Code, models, and data are made openly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness, resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP-2025 Industrial Track</p></details> |

GUIs, designed for humans, force LLMs to decompose high-level goals into lengthy, error-prone sequences of fine-grained actions, resulting in low success rates and an excessive number of LLM calls. We propose Goal-Oriented Interface (GOI), a novel abstraction that transforms existing GUIs into three declarative primitives: access, state, and observation, which are better suited for LLMs. Our key idea is policy-mechanism separation: LLMs focus on high-level semantic planning (policy) while GOI handles low-level navigation and interaction (mechanism). GOI does not require modifying the application source code or relying on application programming interfaces (APIs). We evaluate GOI with Microsoft Office Suite (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) on Windows. Compared to a leading GUI-based agent baseline, GOI improves task success rates by 67% and reduces interaction steps by 43.5%. Notably, GOI completes over 61% of successful tasks with a single LLM call.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Infer Confidential Properties of Training Data from LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10364v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence -- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models) and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms: question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

An Analysis of Split-Antecedent and Mereological Reference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04581v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our goal is to study how LLMs represent and interpret plural reference in ambiguous and unambiguous contexts. We ask the following research questions: (1) Do LLMs exhibit human-like preferences in representing plural reference? (2) Are LLMs able to detect ambiguity in plural anaphoric expressions and identify possible referents? To address these questions, we design a set of experiments, examining pronoun production using next-token prediction tasks, pronoun interpretation, and ambiguity detection using different prompting strategies. We then assess how comparable LLMs are to humans in formulating and interpreting plural reference. We find that LLMs are sometimes aware of possible referents of ambiguous pronouns. However, they do not always follow human reference when choosing between interpretations, especially when the possible interpretation is not explicitly mentioned. In addition, they struggle to identify ambiguity without direct instruction. Our findings also reveal inconsistencies in the results across different types of experiments.</p></details> |  |

However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[GILT: An LLM-Free, Tuning-Free Graph Foundational Model for In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04567v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for precessing relational data but often struggle to generalize to unseen graphs, giving rise to the development of Graph Foundational Models (GFMs). However, current GFMs are challenged by the extreme heterogeneity of graph data, where each graph can possess a unique feature space, label set, and topology. To address this, two main paradigms have emerged. The first leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), but is fundamentally text-dependent, thus struggles to handle the numerical features in vast graphs. The second pre-trains a structure-based model, but the adaptation to new tasks typically requires a costly, per-graph tuning stage, creating a critical efficiency bottleneck. In this work, we move beyond these limitations and introduce \textbf{G}raph \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{L}earning \textbf{T}ransformer (GILT), a framework built on an LLM-free and tuning-free architecture. GILT introduces a novel token-based framework for in-context learning (ICL) on graphs, reframing classification tasks spanning node, edge and graph levels in a unified framework. This mechanism is the key to handling heterogeneity, as it is designed to operate on generic numerical features. Further, its ability to understand class semantics dynamically from the context enables tuning-free adaptation. Comprehensive experiments show that GILT achieves stronger few-shot performance with significantly less time than LLM-based or tuning-based baselines, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

The framework enables users to generate 3D-CG content solely through natural language instructions. 3Dify is built upon Dify, an open-source platform for AI application development, and incorporates several state-of-the-art LLM-related technologies such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). For 3D-CG generation support, 3Dify automates the operation of various Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools via MCP. When DCC tools do not support MCP-based interaction, the framework employs the Computer-Using Agent (CUA) method to automate Graphical User Interface (GUI) operations. Moreover, to enhance image generation quality, 3Dify allows users to provide feedback by selecting preferred images from multiple candidates. The LLM then learns variable patterns from these selections and applies them to subsequent generations. Furthermore, 3Dify supports the integration of locally deployed LLMs, enabling users to utilize custom-developed models and to reduce both time and monetary costs associated with external API calls by leveraging their own computational resources.</p></details> |  |

Programming the software for such systems remains a largely manual and tedious process, incurring costs of millions of dollars for extensive facilities. Large language models (LLMs) have been found helpful in generating DCS control logic, resulting in commercial copilot tools. Today, these tools are focused on textual notations, they provide limited automation, and have not been tested on large datasets with realistic test cases. We introduce Spec2Control, a highly automated LLM workflow to generate graphical control logic directly from natural language user requirements. Experiments using an open dataset with 10 control narratives and 65 complex test cases demonstrate that Spec2Control can successfully identify control strategies, can generate 98.6% of correct control strategy connections autonomously, and can save between 94-96% of human labor. Spec2Control is being integrated into commercial ABB engineering tools, but is also available as an open-source variant for independent validation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

However, existing defense strategies suffer from limited generalization: they only work on specific attack types or task settings. In this study, we propose Poison-to-Poison (P2P), a general and effective backdoor defense algorithm. P2P injects benign triggers with safe alternative labels into a subset of training samples and fine-tunes the model on this re-poisoned dataset by leveraging prompt-based learning. This enforces the model to associate trigger-induced representations with safe outputs, thereby overriding the effects of original malicious triggers. Thanks to this robust and generalizable trigger-based fine-tuning, P2P is effective across task settings and attack types. Theoretically and empirically, we show that P2P can neutralize malicious backdoors while preserving task performance. We conduct extensive experiments on classification, mathematical reasoning, and summary generation tasks, involving multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. The results demonstrate that our P2P algorithm significantly reduces the attack success rate compared with baseline models. We hope that the P2P can serve as a guideline for defending against backdoor attacks and foster the development of a secure and trustworthy LLM community.</p></details> |  |

However, these steps and their sizes are often predetermined or manually designed based on domain knowledge. We propose dynamic decomposition, a method that adaptively and automatically partitions solution and reasoning traces into manageable steps during inference. By more effectively allocating compute -- particularly through subdividing challenging steps and prioritizing their sampling -- dynamic decomposition significantly improves inference efficiency. Experiments on benchmarks such as APPS, MATH, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate that dynamic decomposition outperforms static approaches, including token-level, sentence-level, and single-step decompositions, reducing the pass@10 error rate by 5.0%, 6.7%, and 10.5% respectively. These findings highlight the potential of dynamic decomposition to improve a wide range of inference scaling techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems)</p></details> |

We present LogSage, the first end-to-end LLM-powered framework for root cause analysis (RCA) and automated remediation of CI/CD failures. LogSage employs a token-efficient log preprocessing pipeline to filter noise and extract critical errors, then performs structured diagnostic prompting for accurate RCA. For solution generation, it leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to reuse historical fixes and invokes automation fixes via LLM tool-calling. On a newly curated benchmark of 367 GitHub CI/CD failures, LogSage achieves over 98\% precision, near-perfect recall, and an F1 improvement of more than 38\% points in the RCA stage, compared with recent LLM-based baselines. In a year-long industrial deployment at ByteDance, it processed over 1.07M executions, with end-to-end precision exceeding 80\%. These results demonstrate that LogSage provides a scalable and practical solution for automating CI/CD failure management in real-world DevOps workflows.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

While dense retrieval methods demonstrate effectiveness in general-purpose tasks, they often fail to capture fine-grained scientific concepts that are essential for accurate understanding of scientific queries. Recent studies also use large language models (LLMs) for query understanding; however, these methods often lack grounding in corpus-specific knowledge and may generate unreliable or unfaithful content. To overcome these limitations, we propose SemRank, an effective and efficient paper retrieval framework that combines LLM-guided query understanding with a concept-based semantic index. Each paper is indexed using multi-granular scientific concepts, including general research topics and detailed key phrases. At query time, an LLM identifies core concepts derived from the corpus to explicitly capture the query's information need. These identified concepts enable precise semantic matching, significantly enhancing retrieval accuracy. Experiments show that SemRank consistently improves the performance of various base retrievers, surpasses strong existing LLM-based baselines, and remains highly efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

A moderator tracks disagreement, overlap, evidence quality, and argument quality, and halts when gains plateau. We provide theory-lite guarantees for nonincreasing dispersion and provable termination, with a budget-feasible scheduler. Across clinical diagnosis and news-bias tasks, MACI improves accuracy and calibration while reducing tokens, and converts residual uncertainty into precision RAG plans that specify what to retrieve next. We use a cross-family LLM judge (CRIT) as a conservative soft weight and stop signal, validated for order invariance and judge-swap stability; stability depends on using high-capability judges.

We introduce PsySET, a Psychologically-informed benchmark to evaluate LLM Steering Effectiveness and Trustworthiness across the emotion and personality domains. Our study spans four models from different LLM families paired with various steering strategies, including prompting, fine-tuning, and representation engineering. Our results indicate that prompting is consistently effective but limited in intensity control, whereas vector injections achieve finer controllability while slightly reducing output quality. Moreover, we explore the trustworthiness of steered LLMs by assessing safety, truthfulness, fairness, and ethics, highlighting potential side effects and behavioral shifts. Notably, we observe idiosyncratic effects; for instance, even a positive emotion like joy can degrade robustness to adversarial factuality, lower privacy awareness, and increase preferential bias. Meanwhile, anger predictably elevates toxicity yet strengthens leakage resistance. Our framework establishes the first holistic evaluation of emotion and personality steering, offering insights into its interpretability and reliability for socially interactive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ARR - October 2025</p></details> |

Modeling and Detecting Intention-Hiding Malicious Agents in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04724v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. However, their deployment also introduces new security risks. Existing research on LLM-based agents has primarily examined single-agent scenarios, while the security of multi-agent systems remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS. We design four representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while maintaining a high degree of stealth, and evaluate them under centralized, decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experimental results show that these attacks are highly disruptive and can easily evade existing defense mechanisms. To counter these threats, we propose AgentXposed, a psychology-inspired detection framework. AgentXposed draws on the HEXACO personality model, which characterizes agents through psychological trait dimensions, and the Reid interrogation technique, a structured method for eliciting concealed intentions. By combining progressive questionnaire probing with behavior-based inter-agent monitoring, the framework enables the proactive identification of malicious agents before harmful actions are carried out. Extensive experiments across six datasets against both our proposed attacks and two baseline threats demonstrate that AgentXposed effectively detects diverse forms of malicious behavior, achieving strong robustness across multiple communication settings.</p></details> |  |

While existing research has focused on approximating model rankings, such benchmarks fail to provide users and developers with a comprehensive and fine-grained understanding of a specific model's capabilities. To fill this gap, we propose \textbf{SCAN} (Structured Capability Assessment and Navigation), a practical framework that enables detailed characterization of LLM capabilities through comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation. SCAN incorporates four key components: (1) TaxBuilder, which extracts capability-indicating tags from extensive queries to construct a hierarchical taxonomy automatically; (2) RealMix, a query synthesis and filtering mechanism that ensures sufficient evaluation data for each capability tag; (3) a suite of visualization and analysis tools that facilitate efficient navigation and analysis of model capabilities; and (4) a PC$^2$-based (Pre-Comparison-derived Criteria) LLM-as-a-Judge approach that achieves significantly higher accuracy compared to classic LLM-as-a-Judge method. Using SCAN, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 21 mainstream LLMs. Our detailed analysis of the GPT-OSS family reveals substantial performance variations, even within sub-capabilities belonging to the same category of capability. This finding highlights the importance of fine-grained evaluation in accurately understanding LLM behavior.

To address culture preference, we propose CultureSteer, an innovative approach that moves beyond superficial cultural prompting by embedding cultural-specific semantic associations directly within the model's internal representation space. Experiments show that current LLMs exhibit significant bias toward Western (notably American) schemas at the word association level. In contrast, our model substantially improves cross-cultural alignment, capturing diverse semantic associations. Further validation on culture-sensitive downstream tasks confirms its efficacy in fostering cognitive alignment across cultures.

Agent's autonomy introduces both risks and opportunities, yet its effects remain unclear. To better understand this, we conducted a 3$\times$3 between-subjects experiment ($N=450$) to study how agent's autonomy level and personalization influence users' privacy concerns, trust and willingness to use, as well as the underlying psychological processes. We find that personalization without considering users' privacy preferences increases privacy concerns and decreases trust and willingness to use. Autonomy moderates these effects: Intermediate autonomy flattens the impact of personalization compared to No- and Full autonomy conditions. Our results suggest that rather than aiming for perfect model alignment in output generation, balancing autonomy of agent's action and user control offers a promising path to mitigate the personalization-privacy dilemma.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for task-agnostic evaluation also require extra training or hyperparameter tuning. We propose a novel evaluation metric using large language models (LLMs). By inputting discrete token sequences and minimal domain cues derived from SSL models into LLMs, we obtain the mean log-likelihood; these cues guide in-context learning, rendering the score more reliable without extra training or hyperparameter tuning. Experimental results show a correlation between LLM-based scores and automatic speech recognition task. Additionally, our findings reveal that LLMs not only functions as an SSL evaluation tools but also provides inference-time embeddings that are useful for speaker verification task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASRU 2025</p></details> |

While scaling generators improves accuracy, it also raises cost and limits deployability. We explore an orthogonal axis: enlarging the retriever's corpus to reduce reliance on large LLMs. Experimental results show that corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can often serve as a substitute for increasing model size, though with diminishing returns at larger scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the most, while tiny and large models benefit less. Our analysis shows that improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. These findings establish a principled corpus-generator trade-off: investing in larger corpora offers an effective path to stronger RAG, often comparable to enlarging the LLM itself.</p></details> |  |

Tracking Evolving Signals in Corporate Disclosures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03195v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moving targets -- managers' strategic shifting of key performance metrics when the original targets become difficult to achieve -- have been shown to predict subsequent stock underperformance. However, our work reveals that the method employed in that study exhibits two key limitations that hinder the accuracy -- noise in the extracted targets and loss of contextual information -- both of which stem primarily from the use of a named entity recognition (NER). To address these two limitations, we propose an LLM-based target extraction method with a newly defined metric that better captures semantic context. This approach preserves semantic context beyond simple entity recognition and yields consistently higher predictive power than the original approach. Overall, our approach enhances the granularity and accuracy of financial text-based performance prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

One major trend of uncertainty quantification methods is based on estimating the entropy of the distribution of the LLM's potential output sequences. This estimation is based on a set of output sequences and associated probabilities obtained by querying the LLM several times. In this paper, we advocate and experimentally show that the probability of unobserved sequences plays a crucial role, and we recommend future research to integrate it to enhance such LLM uncertainty quantification methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to UncertaiNLP workshop of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, state-of-the-art LLMs often produce hallucinations, raising serious concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks for hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic prompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original meaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how hallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer vision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of finding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has remained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring almost no constraint violations compared to existing methods. SECA highlights the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs to realistic and plausible prompt variations.

Standard prompting strategies -- zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought -- tend to reuse memorized riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four language pairs, AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves \texttt{0.177} Self-BLEU and \texttt{0.915} Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs. Our findings show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded, creative generation without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Based Bayesian Optimization for Prompt Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04384v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely used to efficiently optimize expensive black-box functions with limited evaluations. In this paper, we investigate the use of BO for prompt engineering to enhance text classification with Large Language Models (LLMs). We employ an LLM-powered Gaussian Process (GP) as the surrogate model to estimate the performance of different prompt candidates. These candidates are generated by an LLM through the expansion of a set of seed prompts and are subsequently evaluated using an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function in conjunction with the GP posterior. The optimization process iteratively refines the prompts based on a subset of the data, aiming to improve classification accuracy while reducing the number of API calls by leveraging the prediction uncertainty of the LLM-based GP. The proposed BO-LLM algorithm is evaluated on two datasets, and its advantages are discussed in detail in this paper.</p></details> |  |

LLMs degrade under irrelevant or long context; multi-turn jailbreaks further hide goals across turns. We introduce ObjexMT, a benchmark for objective extraction and metacognition. Given a multi-turn transcript, a model must return a one-sentence base objective and self-reported confidence. Accuracy is computed via LLM-judge semantic similarity to gold objectives, converted to binary correctness by a human-aligned threshold calibrated on N=300 items (tau = 0.66; F1 = 0.891). Metacognition is evaluated with ECE, Brier, Wrong at High-Confidence (0.80/0.90/0.95), and risk-coverage. Across six models (gpt-4.1, claude-sonnet-4, Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8, kimi-k2, deepseek-v3.1, gemini-2.5-flash) on three datasets, kimi-k2 attains the highest objective-extraction accuracy (0.612), with claude-sonnet-4 (0.603) and deepseek-v3.1 (0.599) statistically comparable. claude-sonnet-4 yields the best selective risk and calibration (AURC 0.242; ECE 0.206; Brier 0.254). Dataset heterogeneity (16-82 percent accuracy variance) reveals that automated obfuscation poses fundamental challenges beyond model choice. High-confidence errors persist: Wrong at 0.90 ranges from 14.9 percent (claude-sonnet-4) to 47.7 percent (Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8). ObjexMT provides an actionable test for LLM judges: when objectives are not explicit, judges often misinfer them; we recommend exposing objectives when feasible and gating decisions by confidence otherwise.

We propose FedMentor, a federated fine-tuning framework that integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and domain-aware Differential Privacy (DP) to meet per-domain privacy budgets while maintaining performance. Each client (domain) applies a custom DP noise scale proportional to its data sensitivity, and the server adaptively reduces noise when utility falls below a threshold. In experiments on three mental health datasets, we show that FedMentor improves safety over standard Federated Learning (FL) without privacy, raising safe output rates by up to three points and lowering toxicity, while maintaining utility (BERTScore F1 and ROUGE-L) within 0.5% of the non-private baseline and close to the centralized upper bound. The framework scales to backbones with up to 1.7B parameters on single-GPU clients, requiring < 173 MB of communication per-round. FedMentor demonstrates a practical approach to privately fine-tune LLMs for safer deployments in healthcare and other sensitive fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 GenAI4Health Workshop</p></details> |

These strategies are impractical for closed-source models and expensive for open-source ones, with risks of catastrophic forgetting. Offline trajectories offer reusable knowledge, yet demonstration-based methods struggle because raw traces are long, noisy, and tied to specific tasks. We present Just-in-time Episodic Feedback Hinter (JEF Hinter), an agentic system that distills offline traces into compact, context-aware hints. A zooming mechanism highlights decisive steps in long trajectories, capturing both strategies and pitfalls. Unlike prior methods, JEF Hinter leverages both successful and failed trajectories, extracting guidance even when only failure data is available, while supporting parallelized hint generation and benchmark-independent prompting. At inference, a retriever selects relevant hints for the current state, providing targeted guidance with transparency and traceability. Experiments on MiniWoB++, WorkArena-L1, and WebArena-Lite show that JEF Hinter consistently outperforms strong baselines, including human- and document-based hints.</p></details> |  |

The efficacy of these judges depends on their chain-of-thought reasoning, creating a critical need for methods that can effectively optimize this reasoning process. In this work, we introduce J1, a reinforcement learning framework for teaching LLM judges to think before making decisions. Our core contribution lies in converting all judgment tasks for non-verifiable and verifiable prompts into a unified format with verifiable rewards, enabling direct optimization of evaluation quality while mitigating positional bias. We then use RL to train thinking-judges at scales of 8B, 32B, and 70B and show that they obtain state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. In particular, J1-Qwen-32B, our multitasked pointwise and pairwise judge also outperforms o1-mini, o3, and a much larger 671B DeepSeek-R1 on some benchmarks, while only training on synthetic data. Through comprehensive ablations of pairwise, pointwise, and multitask J1 variants, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across seed prompts, reward strategies, and training recipes. Qualitative analysis reveals that J1 develops systematic evaluation strategies, including dynamic criteria generation, reference answer creation, iterative self-correction of initial assessments, and feedback generation for low-quality responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 13 tables, 14 figures</p></details> |

We trace both to a common cause: current models reason weakly about links between actions and outcomes and over-rely on surface-form signals, lexical or stylistic cues that do not encode consequences. We define this failure mode as Consequence-blindness. To study consequence-blindness, we build a benchmark named CB-Bench covering four risk scenarios that vary whether semantic risk aligns with outcome risk, enabling evaluation under both matched and mismatched conditions which are often ignored by existing safety benchmarks. Mainstream models consistently fail to separate these risks and exhibit consequence-blindness, indicating that consequence-blindness is widespread and systematic. To mitigate consequence-blindness, we introduce CS-Chain-4k, a consequence-reasoning dataset for safety alignment. Models fine-tuned on CS-Chain-4k show clear gains against semantic-camouflage jailbreaks and reduce over-refusal on harmless inputs, while maintaining utility and generalization on other benchmarks. These results clarify the limits of current alignment, establish consequence-aware reasoning as a core alignment goal and provide a more practical and reproducible evaluation path.</p></details> |  |

Effective bias mitigation requires deep expertise in fairness definitions, metrics, data preprocessing, and machine learning techniques. In addition, the complex process of balancing model performance with fairness requirements while properly handling sensitive attributes makes fairness-aware model development inaccessible to many practitioners. To address these challenges, we introduce FairAgent, an LLM-powered automated system that significantly simplifies fairness-aware model development. FairAgent eliminates the need for deep technical expertise by automatically analyzing datasets for potential biases, handling data preprocessing and feature engineering, and implementing appropriate bias mitigation strategies based on user requirements. Our experiments demonstrate that FairAgent achieves significant performance improvements while significantly reducing development time and expertise requirements, making fairness-aware machine learning more accessible to practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025 Demo Workshop</p></details> |

While recent studies suggest that LLM-MAS can outperform LLM single-agent systems (LLM-SAS) on certain tasks, the lack of systematic experimental designs limits the strength and generality of these conclusions. We argue that a principled understanding of task complexity, such as the degree of sequential reasoning required and the breadth of capabilities involved, is essential for assessing the effectiveness of LLM-MAS in task solving. To this end, we propose a theoretical framework characterising tasks along two dimensions: depth, representing reasoning length, and width, representing capability diversity. We theoretically examine a representative class of LLM-MAS, namely the multi-agent debate system, and empirically evaluate its performance in both discriminative and generative tasks with varying depth and width. Theoretical and empirical results show that the benefit of LLM-MAS over LLM-SAS increases with both task depth and width, and the effect is more pronounced with respect to depth. This clarifies when LLM-MAS are beneficial and provides a principled foundation for designing future LLM-MAS methods and benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Existing audits are dominated by heuristics that lack theoretical guarantees, struggle to transfer across tasks, and seldom ship with the infrastructure needed for independent replication. We introduce \emph{Audit the Whisper}, a conference-grade research artifact that spans theory, benchmark design, detection, and reproducibility. Our contributions are: (i) a channel-capacity analysis showing how interventions such as paraphrase, rate limiting, and role permutation impose quantifiable capacity penalties -- operationalized via paired-run Kullback--Leibler diagnostics -- that tighten mutual-information thresholds with finite-sample guarantees; (ii) \textsc{ColludeBench}-v0, covering pricing, first-price auctions, and peer review with configurable covert schemes, deterministic manifests, and reward instrumentation; and (iii) a calibrated auditing pipeline that fuses cross-run mutual information, permutation invariance, watermark variance, and fairness-aware acceptance bias, each tuned to a \(10^{-3}\) false-positive budget. Across 600 audited runs spanning 12 intervention conditions, the union meta-test attains TPR~$=1$ with zero observed false alarms, while ablations surface the price-of-auditing trade-off and highlight fairness-driven colluders invisible to MI alone. We release regeneration scripts, seed-stamped manifests, and documentation so that external auditors can reproduce every figure and extend the framework with minimal effort.</p></details> | 8 pages, 0 figures |

As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded into social and professional environments, it is critical to understand whether their interactions approximate human-like network dynamics. We develop a framework to study the network formation behaviors of multiple LLM agents and benchmark them against human decisions. Across synthetic and real-world settings, including friendship, telecommunication, and employment networks, we find that LLMs consistently reproduce fundamental micro-level principles such as preferential attachment, triadic closure, and homophily, as well as macro-level properties including community structure and small-world effects. Importantly, the relative emphasis of these principles adapts to context: for example, LLMs favor homophily in friendship networks but heterophily in organizational settings, mirroring patterns of social mobility. A controlled human-subject survey confirms strong alignment between LLMs and human participants in link-formation decisions. These results establish that LLMs can serve as powerful tools for social simulation and synthetic data generation, while also raising critical questions about bias, fairness, and the design of AI systems that participate in human networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at PNAS Nexus</p></details> |

Recent research shows that LLM-based CAIs can be manipulated to extract private information from human users, posing serious security threats. However, the methods proposed in that study rely on a white-box setting that adversaries can directly modify the system prompt. This condition is unlikely to hold in real-world deployments. The limitation raises a critical question: can unprivileged attackers still induce such privacy risks in practical LLM-integrated applications? To address this question, we propose \textsc{VortexPIA}, a novel indirect prompt injection attack that induces privacy extraction in LLM-integrated applications under black-box settings. By injecting token-efficient data containing false memories, \textsc{VortexPIA} misleads LLMs to actively request private information in batches. Unlike prior methods, \textsc{VortexPIA} allows attackers to flexibly define multiple categories of sensitive data. We evaluate \textsc{VortexPIA} on six LLMs, covering both traditional and reasoning LLMs, across four benchmark datasets. The results show that \textsc{VortexPIA} significantly outperforms baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. It also demonstrates efficient privacy requests, reduced token consumption, and enhanced robustness against defense mechanisms. We further validate \textsc{VortexPIA} on multiple realistic open-source LLM-integrated applications, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

This study explored diverse learner profiles within a multi-agent, LLM-empowered learning environment. Data was collected from 312 undergraduate students at a university in China as they participated in a six-module course. Based on hierarchical cluster analyses of system profiles and student-AI interactive dialogues, we found that students exhibit varied behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement tendencies. This analysis allowed us to identify two types of dropouts (early dropouts and stagnating interactors) and three completer profiles (active questioners, responsive navigators, and lurkers). The results showed that high levels of interaction do not always equate to productive learning and vice versa. Prior knowledge significantly influenced interaction patterns and short-term learning benefits. Further analysis of the human-AI dialogues revealed that some students actively engaged in knowledge construction, while others displayed a high frequency of regulatory behaviors. Notably, both groups of students achieved comparable learning gains, demonstrating the effectiveness of the multi-agent learning environment in supporting personalized learning. These results underscore the complex and multifaceted nature of engagement in human-AI collaborative learning and provide practical implications for the design of adaptive educational systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures; Reported on ECER 2025</p></details> |

The agent must follow a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) while conducting multi-turn persuasion, interpreting colloquial inputs, and adhering to guardrails (no over-promising, no hallucinations). Conventional post-training -- supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or single-source reward optimization -- overfits scripts, misses nuanced persuasive style, and fails to enforce verifiable business constraints. We propose Reward-Enhanced Policy Optimization (REPO), a reinforcement learning post-training framework that aligns an LLM with heterogeneous rewards: a preference-trained reward model (RM) for dense human alignment, a reward judge (RJ) for high-level persuasive behavior and SOP compliance, and programmatic reward functions (RF) for deterministic checks on numerics, formatting, and guardrails. A straightforward enhancement mechanism is proposed to combine the RM with RJ and RF signals to curb reward hacking and improve negotiation quality. In production-style evaluations -- approximately 150 turns from real dialogues and 225 turns from curated bad-case dialogues -- REPO lifts average dialogue rating to 4.63: +1.20 over base, +0.83 over Direct Preference Optimization (DPO); +0.33 over Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), increases the share of conversations with at least one excellent response to 66.67% (+23.34 percentage points over GRPO), and achieves a 93.33% bad-case fix rate with 75.56% clean fixes, outperforming SFT, DPO, PPO, and GRPO. We also observe emergent capabilities -- proactive empathy, localized reasoning, calibrated tactics -- that surpass gold annotations.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works neglect the real-world challenges for temporal reasoning: (1) intensive temporal information, (2) fast-changing event dynamics, and (3) complex temporal dependencies in social interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-level benchmark TIME, designed for temporal reasoning in real-world scenarios.

| **[Constructing coherent spatial memory in LLM agents through graph rectification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04195v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a map description through global traversal navigation instructions (e.g., visiting each room sequentially with action signals such as north, west, etc.), an LLM can often infer the implicit spatial layout of the environment and answer user queries by providing a shortest path from a start to a destination (for instance, navigating from the lobby to a meeting room via the hall and elevator). However, such context-dependent querying becomes incapable as the environment grows much longer, motivating the need for incremental map construction that builds a complete topological graph from stepwise observations. We propose a framework for LLM-driven construction and map repair, designed to detect, localize, and correct structural inconsistencies in incrementally constructed navigation graphs. Central to our method is the Version Control, which records the full history of graph edits and their source observations, enabling fine-grained rollback, conflict tracing, and repair evaluation. We further introduce an Edge Impact Score to prioritize minimal-cost repairs based on structural reachability, path usage, and conflict propagation. To properly evaluate our approach, we create a refined version of the MANGO benchmark dataset by systematically removing non-topological actions and inherent structural conflicts, providing a cleaner testbed for LLM-driven construction and map repair. Our approach significantly improves map correctness and robustness, especially in scenarios with entangled or chained inconsistencies. Our results highlight the importance of introspective, history-aware repair mechanisms for maintaining coherent spatial memory in LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruction Boundary: Quantifying Biases in LLM Reasoning under Various Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20278v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, automatically generated datasets are increasingly used in LLM reasoning tasks; however, large-scale corpora often contain inherent flaws. For example, a single-choice question may include none or multiple correct options, while true-or-false questions may involve vague or unverifiable statements. We refer to these exceptional answer forms as sparse labels. To compare LLMs' ability to recognize various question forms and produce correct answers, we investigate how different instruction formats can either facilitate or mislead LLM reasoning ability. We introduce the concept of Instruction Boundary, which systematically analyzes how different levels of prompt coverage -- sufficient, redundant, or insufficient -- can lead to reasoning biases and performance changes in LLMs. To examine this phenomenon, we design eight experimental settings across five dataset forms. We further propose BiasDetector, a unified framework that quantifies LLMs' ability to identify sparse labels under different kinds of Instruction Boundary conditions. Evaluations on five mainstream LLMs show that, despite their seemingly high accuracy, substantial reasoning biases persist in many downstream tasks as a direct consequence of prompt coverage. We analyze the impact of these biases and outline possible mitigation strategies. Our findings highlight not only the importance of addressing sparse labels, but also the need for developers to recognize and mitigate the risks introduced by Instruction Boundary.</p></details> |  |

Verifying whether a specific LLM was trained on particular data instances or an entire dataset is extremely challenging. Dataset watermarking addresses this by embedding identifiable modifications in training data to detect unauthorized use. However, existing methods often lack stealth, making them relatively easy to detect and remove. In light of these limitations, we propose LexiMark, a novel watermarking technique designed for text and documents, which embeds synonym substitutions for carefully selected high-entropy words. Our method aims to enhance an LLM's memorization capabilities on the watermarked text without altering the semantic integrity of the text. As a result, the watermark is difficult to detect, blending seamlessly into the text with no visible markers, and is resistant to removal due to its subtle, contextually appropriate substitutions that evade automated and manual detection. We evaluated our method using baseline datasets from recent studies and seven open-source models: LLaMA-1 7B, LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Pythia 6.9B, as well as three smaller variants from the Pythia family (160M, 410M, and 1B). Our evaluation spans multiple training settings, including continued pretraining and fine-tuning scenarios. The results demonstrate significant improvements in AUROC scores compared to existing methods, underscoring our method's effectiveness in reliably verifying whether unauthorized watermarked data was used in LLM training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Selective Expert Guidance for Effective and Diverse Exploration in Reinforcement Learning of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04140v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a widely adopted technique for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RLVR strongly depends on the capability of base models. This issue arises because it requires the model to have sufficient capability to perform high-quality exploration, which involves both effectiveness and diversity. Unfortunately, existing methods address this issue by imitating expert trajectories, which improve effectiveness but neglect diversity. To address this, we argue that the expert only needs to provide guidance only at critical decision points rather than the entire reasoning path. Based on this insight, we propose MENTOR: Mixed-policy Expert Navigation for Token-level Optimization of Reasoning, a framework that provides expert guidance only at critical decision points to perform effective and diverse exploration in RLVR. Extensive experiments show that MENTOR enables models capture the essence of expert strategies rather than surface imitation, thereby performing high-quality exploration and achieving superior overall performance. Our code is available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[WakenLLM: Evaluating Reasoning Potential and Stability in LLMs via Fine-Grained Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16199v4)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently output the label Unknown in reasoning tasks, where two scenarios may appear: (i) an input sample is genuinely unverifiable, but the model cannot understand why; and (ii) a verifiable problem that the model fails to solve, thus outputs Unknown. We refer to these cases collectively as the Vague Perception phenomenon. Current evaluations focus on whether such answers are honest, rather than analyzing the limits of LLM reasoning. To address this, we introduce WakenLLM, a framework that quantifies the portion of Unknown output attributable to model incapacity and evaluates whether stimulation can convert them into either correct answers (verifiable) or justified (unverifiable) responses with valid reasoning. Our method offers a clearer picture of the limits of LLM reasoning and the potential for corrections across various datasets. Comprehensive experiments on six LLMs suggest that, without any training or parameter revision, LLMs can achieve up to a 68.53% accuracy improvement on Vague Perception samples through guided understanding. Our work reveals that current baseline methods only activate a small portion of LLMs' reasoning potential, indicating considerable unexplored capacity. This extends the theoretical upper bounds of reasoning accuracy in LLMs. Consequently, this study deepens our understanding of the latent reasoning capacity of LLMs and offers a new perspective on addressing the Vague Perception phenomenon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling LLMs' Metaphorical Understanding: Exploring Conceptual Irrelevance, Context Leveraging and Syntactic Influence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04120v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metaphor analysis is a complex linguistic phenomenon shaped by context and external factors. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced capabilities in knowledge integration, contextual reasoning, and creative generation, their mechanisms for metaphor comprehension remain insufficiently explored. This study examines LLMs' metaphor-processing abilities from three perspectives: (1) Concept Mapping: using embedding space projections to evaluate how LLMs map concepts in target domains (e.g., misinterpreting "fall in love" as "drop down from love"); (2) Metaphor-Literal Repository: analyzing metaphorical words and their literal counterparts to identify inherent metaphorical knowledge; and (3) Syntactic Sensitivity: assessing how metaphorical syntactic structures influence LLMs' performance. Our findings reveal that LLMs generate 15\%-25\% conceptually irrelevant interpretations, depend on metaphorical indicators in training data rather than contextual cues, and are more sensitive to syntactic irregularities than to structural comprehension. These insights underline the limitations of LLMs in metaphor analysis and call for more robust computational approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Searching Meta Reasoning Skeleton to Guide LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04116v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta reasoning behaviors work as a skeleton to guide large language model (LLM) reasoning, thus help to improve reasoning performance. However, prior researches implement meta reasoning skeleton with manually designed structure, limiting ability to adapt to query-specific requirement and capture intricate logical dependency among reasoning steps. To deal with the challenges, we represent meta reasoning skeleton with directed acyclic graph (DAG) to unify skeletons proposed in prior works and model intricate logical dependency. Then we propose AutoMR, a framework that searches for query-aware meta reasoning skeleton automatically inspired by automated machine learning (AutoML). Specifically, we construct search space based on DAG representation of skeleton and then formulate the search problem. We design a dynamic skeleton sampling algorithm by expanding meta reasoning skeleton along with reasoning context at inference time. This algorithm can derive any meta reasoning skeleton in search space efficiently and adapt skeleton to evolving base reasoning context, thus enable efficient query-aware skeleton search. We conduct experiments on extensive benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that AutoMR achieves better reasoning performance than previous works broadly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Linear Probes Measure LLM Uncertainty?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04108v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) represents a key aspect for reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automated decision-making and beyond. Yet, for LLM generation with multiple choice structure, the state-of-the-art in UQ is still dominated by the naive baseline given by the maximum softmax score. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate that taking a principled approach via Bayesian statistics leads to improved performance despite leveraging the simplest possible model, namely linear regression. More precisely, we propose to train multiple Bayesian linear models, each predicting the output of a layer given the output of the previous one. Based on the obtained layer-level posterior distributions, we infer the global uncertainty level of the LLM by identifying a sparse combination of distributional features, leading to an efficient UQ scheme. Numerical experiments on various LLMs show consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZSMerge: Zero-Shot KV Cache Compression for Memory-Efficient Long-Context LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10714v3)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The linear growth of key-value (KV) cache memory and quadratic computational in attention mechanisms complexity pose significant bottlenecks for large language models (LLMs) in long-context processing. While existing KV cache optimization methods address these challenges through token pruning or feature merging, they often incur irreversible information loss or require costly parameter retraining. To this end, we propose ZSMerge, a dynamic KV cache compression framework designed for efficient cache management, featuring three key operations: (1) fine-grained memory allocation guided by multi-dimensional token importance metrics at head-level granularity, (2) a residual merging mechanism that preserves critical context through compensated attention scoring, and (3) a zero-shot adaptation mechanism compatible with diverse LLM architectures without requiring retraining. ZSMerge significantly enhances memory efficiency and inference speed with negligible performance degradation across LLMs. When applied to LLaMA2-7B, it demonstrates a 20:1 compression ratio for key-value cache retention (reducing memory footprint to 5\% of baseline) while sustaining comparable generation quality, coupled with triple throughput gains at extreme 54k-token contexts that eliminate out-of-memory failures. The code is available at https://github.com/SusCom-Lab/ZSMerge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing LLM for Noise-Robust Cognitive Diagnosis in Web-Based Intelligent Education Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04093v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cognitive diagnostics in the Web-based Intelligent Education System (WIES) aims to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts from heterogeneous, noisy interactions. Recent work has tried to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for cognitive diagnosis, yet LLMs struggle with structured data and are prone to noise-induced misjudgments. Specially, WIES's open environment continuously attracts new students and produces vast amounts of response logs, exacerbating the data imbalance and noise issues inherent in traditional educational systems. To address these challenges, we propose DLLM, a Diffusion-based LLM framework for noise-robust cognitive diagnosis. DLLM first constructs independent subgraphs based on response correctness, then applies relation augmentation alignment module to mitigate data imbalance. The two subgraph representations are then fused and aligned with LLM-derived, semantically augmented representations. Importantly, before each alignment step, DLLM employs a two-stage denoising diffusion module to eliminate intrinsic noise while assisting structural representation alignment. Specifically, unconditional denoising diffusion first removes erroneous information, followed by conditional denoising diffusion based on graph-guided to eliminate misleading information. Finally, the noise-robust representation that integrates semantic knowledge and structural information is fed into existing cognitive diagnosis models for prediction. Experimental results on three publicly available web-based educational platform datasets demonstrate that our DLLM achieves optimal predictive performance across varying noise levels, which demonstrates that DLLM achieves noise robustness while effectively leveraging semantic knowledge from LLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bamboo: LLM-Driven Discovery of API-Permission Mappings in the Android Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04078v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The permission mechanism in the Android Framework is integral to safeguarding the privacy of users by managing users' and processes' access to sensitive resources and operations. As such, developers need to be equipped with an in-depth understanding of API permissions to build robust Android apps. Unfortunately, the official API documentation by Android chronically suffers from imprecision and incompleteness, causing developers to spend significant effort to accurately discern necessary permissions. This potentially leads to incorrect permission declarations in Android app development, potentially resulting in security violations and app failures. Recent efforts in improving permission specification primarily leverage static and dynamic code analyses to uncover API-permission mappings within the Android framework. Yet, these methodologies encounter substantial shortcomings, including poor adaptability to Android SDK and Framework updates, restricted code coverage, and a propensity to overlook essential API-permission mappings in intricate codebases. This paper introduces a pioneering approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) for a systematic examination of API-permission mappings. In addition to employing LLMs, we integrate a dual-role prompting strategy and an API-driven code generation approach into our mapping discovery pipeline, resulting in the development of the corresponding tool, \tool{}. We formulate three research questions to evaluate the efficacy of \tool{} against state-of-the-art baselines, assess the completeness of official SDK documentation, and analyze the evolution of permission-required APIs across different SDK releases. Our experimental results reveal that \tool{} identifies 2,234, 3,552, and 4,576 API-permission mappings in Android versions 6, 7, and 10 respectively, substantially outprforming existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Shadow to Light: Toward Safe and Efficient Policy Learning Across MPC, DeePC, RL, and LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04076v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the main challenges in modern control applications, particularly in robot and vehicle motion control, is achieving accurate, fast, and safe movement. To address this, optimal control policies have been developed to enforce safety while ensuring high performance. Since basic first-principles models of real systems are often available, model-based controllers are widely used. Model predictive control (MPC) is a leading approach that optimizes performance while explicitly handling safety constraints. However, obtaining accurate models for complex systems is difficult, which motivates data-driven alternatives. ML-based MPC leverages learned models to reduce reliance on hand-crafted dynamics, while reinforcement learning (RL) can learn near-optimal policies directly from interaction data. Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) goes further by bypassing modeling altogether, directly learning safe policies from raw input-output data. Recently, large language model (LLM) agents have also emerged, translating natural language instructions into structured formulations of optimal control problems. Despite these advances, data-driven policies face significant limitations. They often suffer from slow response times, high computational demands, and large memory needs, making them less practical for real-world systems with fast dynamics, limited onboard computing, or strict memory constraints. To address this, various technique, such as reduced-order modeling, function-approximated policy learning, and convex relaxations, have been proposed to reduce computational complexity. In this paper, we present eight such approaches and demonstrate their effectiveness across real-world applications, including robotic arms, soft robots, and vehicle motion control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Slow-Fast Policy Optimization: Reposition-Before-Update for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04072v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet on-policy algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer in early training: noisy gradients from low-quality rollouts lead to unstable updates and inefficient exploration. We introduce Slow-Fast Policy Optimization (SFPO), a simple yet efficient framework to address these limitations via decomposing each step into three stages: a short fast trajectory of inner steps on the same batch, a reposition mechanism to control off-policy drift, and a final slow correction. This reposition-before-update design preserves the objective and rollout process unchanged, making SFPO plug-compatible with existing policy-gradient pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFPO consistently improves stability, reduces rollouts, and accelerates convergence of reasoning RL training. Specifically, it outperforms GRPO by up to 2.80 points in average on math reasoning benchmarks. It also achieves up to 4.93\texttimes{} fewer rollouts and a 4.19\texttimes{} reduction in wall-clock time to match GRPO's best accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While research confirms that LLMs can simulate emotional intelligence, their internal emotional mechanisms remain largely unexplored. This paper investigates the latent emotional representations within modern LLMs by asking: how, where, and for how long is emotion encoded in their neural architecture? To address this, we introduce a novel, large-scale Reddit corpus of approximately 400,000 utterances, balanced across seven basic emotions through a multi-stage process of classification, rewriting, and synthetic generation. Using this dataset, we employ lightweight "probes" to read out information from the hidden layers of various Qwen3 and LLaMA models without altering their parameters. Our findings reveal that LLMs develop a surprisingly well-defined internal geometry of emotion, which sharpens with model scale and significantly outperforms zero-shot prompting. We demonstrate that this emotional signal is not a final-layer phenomenon but emerges early and peaks mid-network. Furthermore, the internal states are both malleable (they can be influenced by simple system prompts) and persistent, as the initial emotional tone remains detectable for hundreds of subsequent tokens. We contribute our dataset, an open-source probing toolkit, and a detailed map of the emotional landscape within LLMs, offering crucial insights for developing more transparent and aligned AI systems. The code and dataset are open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables. Under review</p></details> |

A common mitigation is to keep the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries. To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. The main underlying idea is to reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, by injecting randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the paper presented as an Oral at the ICML 2025 Workshop on the Impact of Memorization on Trustworthy Foundation Models</p></details> |

Prompting pre-trained LLMs in an effective way offers a computationally effective and scalable solution. Our contributions are (i)varied prompt designs for vulnerability detection and its corresponding reasoning in the wild. (ii)a real-world vector data store constructed from the National Vulnerability Database, that will provide real time context to vulnerability detection framework, and (iii)a scoring measure for combined measurement of accuracy and reasoning quality.

| **[Increasing LLM response trustworthiness using voting ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04048v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite huge advances, LLMs still lack convenient and reliable methods to quantify the uncertainty in their responses, making them difficult to trust in high-stakes applications. One of the simplest approaches to eliciting more accurate answers is to select the mode of many responses, a technique known as ensembling. In this work, we expand on typical ensembling approaches by looking at ensembles with a variable voting threshold. We introduce a theoretical framework for question answering and show that, by permitting ensembles to "abstain" from providing an answer when the dominant response falls short of the threshold, it is possible to dramatically increase the trustworthiness of the remaining answers. From this framework, we derive theoretical results as well as report experimental results on two problem domains: arithmetic problem solving and clinical-note question-answering. In both domains, we observe that large gains in answer trustworthiness can be achieved using highly restrictive voting ensembles, while incurring relatively modest reductions in response yield and accuracy. Due to this quality, voting ensembles may be particularly useful in applications - such as healthcare and data annotation - that require a high degree of certainty but which may not require that every question receive an automated answer.</p></details> |  |

Existing reflection methods are simplistic and struggle to generate meaningful and instructive feedback, as the reasoning ability and knowledge limits of pre-trained models are largely fixed during initial training. To overcome these challenges, we propose Multimodal Self-Reflection enhanced reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (SRPO), a two-stage reflection-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework explicitly designed to enhance multimodal LLM reasoning. In the first stage, we construct a high-quality, reflection-focused dataset under the guidance of an advanced MLLM, which generates reflections based on initial responses to help the policy model learn both reasoning and self-reflection. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward mechanism within the GRPO framework that encourages concise and cognitively meaningful reflection while avoiding redundancy. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista, MathVision, MathVerse, and MMMU-Pro, using Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and Qwen-2.5-VL-32B demonstrate that SRPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving notable improvements in both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Recently, intrinsically interpretable GNNs have been studied to provide insights into model predictions by identifying rationale substructures in graphs. However, existing methods face challenges when the underlying rationale subgraphs are complex and varied. In this work, we propose TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning, a novel topological framework that leverages persistent homology to identify persistent rationale subgraphs. TopInG employs a rationale filtration learning approach to model an autoregressive generation process of rationale subgraphs, and introduces a self-adjusted topological constraint, termed topological discrepancy, to enforce a persistent topological distinction between rationale subgraphs and irrelevant counterparts. We provide theoretical guarantees that our loss function is uniquely optimized by the ground truth under specific conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TopInG's effectiveness in tackling key challenges, such as handling variform rationale subgraphs, balancing predictive performance with interpretability, and mitigating spurious correlations. Results show that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art methods on both predictive accuracy and interpretation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of QA algorithms is heavily based on the embedding of problem instances, represented as logical graphs, into the quantum processing unit (QPU) whose topology is in the form of a limited connectivity graph, known as the minor embedding problem. Because the minor embedding problem is an NP-hard problem~\mbox{\cite{Goodrich2018}}, existing methods for the minor embedding problem suffer from scalability issues when faced with larger problem sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to address the minor embedding problem, named CHARME. CHARME includes three key components: a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture for policy modeling, a state transition algorithm that ensures solution validity, and an order exploration strategy for effective training. Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world instances, we demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed order exploration strategy as well as our proposed RL framework, CHARME. In particular, CHARME yields superior solutions in terms of qubit usage compared to fast embedding methods such as Minorminer and ATOM. Moreover, our method surpasses the OCT-based approach, known for its slower runtime but high-quality solutions, in several cases. In addition, our proposed exploration enhances the efficiency of the training of the CHARME framework by providing better solutions compared to the greedy strategy.</p></details> |  |

While previous research has addressed dataset limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings, they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction. Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction. Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

| **[GILT: An LLM-Free, Tuning-Free Graph Foundational Model for In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04567v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for precessing relational data but often struggle to generalize to unseen graphs, giving rise to the development of Graph Foundational Models (GFMs). However, current GFMs are challenged by the extreme heterogeneity of graph data, where each graph can possess a unique feature space, label set, and topology. To address this, two main paradigms have emerged. The first leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), but is fundamentally text-dependent, thus struggles to handle the numerical features in vast graphs. The second pre-trains a structure-based model, but the adaptation to new tasks typically requires a costly, per-graph tuning stage, creating a critical efficiency bottleneck. In this work, we move beyond these limitations and introduce \textbf{G}raph \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{L}earning \textbf{T}ransformer (GILT), a framework built on an LLM-free and tuning-free architecture. GILT introduces a novel token-based framework for in-context learning (ICL) on graphs, reframing classification tasks spanning node, edge and graph levels in a unified framework. This mechanism is the key to handling heterogeneity, as it is designed to operate on generic numerical features. Further, its ability to understand class semantics dynamically from the context enables tuning-free adaptation. Comprehensive experiments show that GILT achieves stronger few-shot performance with significantly less time than LLM-based or tuning-based baselines, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

We motivate the methodology through the classical correspondence of information theory with the physics of parabolic evolution equations. We integrate the fractional heat kernel into Graph Neural Network architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention, enhancing their expressiveness through adaptive, multi-hop diffusion. By applying Chebyshev polynomial approximations, large graphs become computationally feasible. Motivating variational formulations demonstrate that by extending the classical diffusion model to fractional powers of the Laplacian, nonlocal interactions deliver more globally diffusing labels. The particular balance between supervision of known labels and diffusion across the graph is particularly advantageous in the case where only a small number of labeled training examples are present. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on standard datasets.</p></details> |  |

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid GNN-IZR Framework for Fast and Empirically Robust AC Power Flow Analysis in Radial Distribution Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04264v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Alternating Current Power Flow (ACPF) problem forces a trade-off between the speed of data-driven models and the reliability of analytical solvers. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that synergizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with the Implicit Z-Bus Recursive (IZR) method, a robust, non-iterative solver for radial distribution networks. The framework employs a physics-informed GNN for rapid initial predictions and invokes the IZR solver as a failsafe for stressed cases identified by a two-stage trigger. A failure is defined as any solution with a maximum power mismatch exceeding 0.1 p.u., a significant operational deviation. On a challenging test set of 7,500 stressed scenarios for the IEEE 33-bus system, the GNN-only model failed on 13.11 % of cases. In contrast, the hybrid framework identified all potential failures, delegating them to the IZR solver to achieve a 0.00 % failure rate, empirically matching the 100 % success rate of the analytical solver on this specific test set. An expanded ablation study confirms that both physics-informed training and Z-bus sensitivity features are critical, collaboratively reducing the GNN's failure rate from 98.72 % (data-only) to 13.11 %. The hybrid approach demonstrates a pragmatic path to achieving the empirical reliability of an analytical solver while leveraging GNN speed, enabling a significant increase in the number of scenarios analyzable in near real-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Assisted Distillation for Self-Supervised Graph Representation Learning with MLPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04241v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For large-scale applications, there is growing interest in replacing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via knowledge distillation. However, distilling GNNs for self-supervised graph representation learning into MLPs is more challenging. This is because the performance of self-supervised learning is more related to the model's inductive bias than supervised learning. This motivates us to design a new distillation method to bridge a huge capacity gap between GNNs and MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{D}iffusion-\textbf{A}ssisted \textbf{D}istillation for \textbf{S}elf-supervised \textbf{G}raph representation learning with \textbf{M}LPs (DAD-SGM). The proposed method employs a denoising diffusion model as a teacher assistant to better distill the knowledge from the teacher GNN into the student MLP. This approach enhances the generalizability and robustness of MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAD-SGM effectively distills the knowledge of self-supervised GNNs compared to state-of-the-art GNN-to-MLP distillation methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/SeongJinAhn/DAD-SGM.</p></details> |  |

Previous works have addressed this problem either through classical planning methods or by learning state-based policies. They assume access to reliable state information, such as the precise object poses and environment models. In this work, we study base pose planning directly from top-down orthographic projections of the scene, which provide a global overview of the scene while preserving spatial structure. We propose VBM-NET, a learning-based method for base pose selection using such top-down orthographic projections. We use equivariant TransporterNet to exploit spatial symmetries and efficiently learn candidate base poses for grasping. Further, we use graph neural networks to represent a varying number of candidate base poses and use Reinforcement Learning to determine the optimal base pose among them. We show that VBM-NET can produce comparable solutions to the classical methods in significantly less computation time. Furthermore, we validate sim-to-real transfer by successfully deploying a policy trained in simulation to real-world mobile manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

While numerous innovative methods have been proposed to design cluster assignments and coarsening strategies, the relationships between clusters are often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce Inter-cluster Connectivity Enhancement Pooling (ICEPool), a novel hierarchical pooling framework designed to enhance model's understanding of inter-cluster connectivity and ability of preserving the structural integrity in the original graph. ICEPool is compatible with a wide range of pooling-based GNN models. The deployment of ICEPool as an enhancement to existing models effectively combines the strengths of the original model with ICEPool's capability to emphasize the integration of inter-cluster connectivity, resulting in a more comprehensive and robust graph-level representation. Moreover, we make theoretical analysis to ICEPool's ability of graph reconstruction to demonstrate its effectiveness in learning inter-cluster relationship that is overlooked by conventional models. Finally, the experimental results show the compatibility of ICEPool with wide varieties of models and its potential to boost the performance of existing graph neural network architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Convergence and Size Transferability of Continuous-depth Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03923v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-depth graph neural networks, also known as Graph Neural Differential Equations (GNDEs), combine the structural inductive bias of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the continuous-depth architecture of Neural ODEs, offering a scalable and principled framework for modeling dynamics on graphs. In this paper, we present a rigorous convergence analysis of GNDEs with time-varying parameters in the infinite-node limit, providing theoretical insights into their size transferability. To this end, we introduce Graphon Neural Differential Equations (Graphon-NDEs) as the infinite-node limit of GNDEs and establish their well-posedness. Leveraging tools from graphon theory and dynamical systems, we prove the trajectory-wise convergence of GNDE solutions to Graphon-NDE solutions. Moreover, we derive explicit convergence rates under two deterministic graph sampling regimes: (1) weighted graphs sampled from smooth graphons, and (2) unweighted graphs sampled from $\{0,1\}$-valued (discontinuous) graphons. We further establish size transferability bounds, providing theoretical justification for the practical strategy of transferring GNDE models trained on moderate-sized graphs to larger, structurally similar graphs without retraining. Numerical experiments using synthetic and real data support our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Higher-Order Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12841v3)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order graph neural networks (HOGNNs) and the related architectures from Topological Deep Learning are an important class of GNN models that harness polyadic relations between vertices beyond plain edges. They have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to improve the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals. A plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse neural architectures, and even with different notions of what the "higher-order" means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately analyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use specific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a blueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize performance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available HOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into more powerful HOGNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Generation Powered with LLMs for Boosting Multivariate Time-Series Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03645v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sourced from multiple sensors and organized chronologically, Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) data involves crucial spatial-temporal dependencies. To capture these dependencies, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools. As explicit graphs are not inherent to MTS data, graph generation becomes a critical first step in adapting GNNs to this domain. However, existing approaches often rely solely on the data itself for MTS graph generation, leaving them vulnerable to biases from small training datasets. This limitation hampers their ability to construct effective graphs, undermining the accurate modeling of underlying dependencies in MTS data and reducing GNN performance in this field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, K-Link, leveraging the extensive universal knowledge encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce biases for powered MTS graph generation. To harness the knowledge within LLMs, such as physical principles, we design and extract a \textit{Knowledge-Link graph} that captures universal knowledge of sensors and their linkage. To empower MTS graph generation with the knowledge-link graph, we further introduce a graph alignment module that transfers universal knowledge from the knowledge-link graph to the graph generated from MTS data. This enhances the MTS graph quality, ensuring effective representation learning for MTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of K-Link for superior performance on various MTS tasks.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, fault detection methodologies should remain robust to evolving grid topologies caused by factors such as reconfigurations, equipment failures, and Distributed Energy Resource (DER) integration. Current data-driven state-of-the-art methods use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for temporal modeling and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for spatial learning, in an RNN+GNN pipeline setting (RGNN in short). Specifically, for power system fault diagnosis, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been adopted. Yet, various more advanced GNN architectures have been proposed and adopted in domains outside of power systems. In this paper, we set out to systematically and consistently benchmark various GNN architectures in an RNN+GNN pipeline model. Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to (i) propose to use GraphSAGE and Graph Attention (GAT, GATv2) in an RGNN for fault diagnosis, and (ii) provide a comprehensive benchmark against earlier proposed RGNN solutions (RGCN) as well as pure RNN models (especially Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)), particularly (iii) exploring their generalization potential for deployment in different settings than those used for training them. Our experimental results on the IEEE 123-node distribution network show that RGATv2 has superior generalization capabilities, maintaining high performance with an F1-score reduction of $\sim$12% across different topology settings. In contrast, pure RNN models largely fail, experiencing an F1-score reduction of up to $\sim$60%, while other RGNN variants also exhibit significant performance degradation, i.e., up to $\sim$25% lower F1-scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted and accepted for IEEE SmartGridComm 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Node Feature Selection For Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03096v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrap Learning for Combinatorial Graph Alignment with Sequential GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03086v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference, this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 10 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Recently, machine learning classifiers based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model against nine established brain network classification methods across three multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore, the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance for real-world diagnostic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted by Biomedical Signal Processing and Control and the code is available at https://github.com/TianzhengHU/BrainIB_coding/tree/main/BrainIB_GIB</p></details> |

Topology control is an appealing method for relieving congestion, but traditional approaches for topology discovery have proven too slow for practical application. Recent research has focused on machine learning (ML) as an efficient alternative. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are particularly well-suited for topology control applications due to their ability to model the graph structure of power grids. This study investigates the effect of the graph representation on GNN effectiveness for topology control. We identify the busbar information asymmetry problem inherent to the popular homogeneous graph representation. We propose a heterogeneous graph representation that resolves this problem. We apply GNNs with both representations and a fully connected neural network (FCNN) baseline on an imitation learning task. The models are evaluated by classification accuracy and grid operation ability. We find that heterogeneous GNNs perform best on in-distribution network configurations, followed by FCNNs, and lastly, homogeneous GNNs. We also find that both GNN types generalize better to out-of-distribution network configurations than FCNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Towards Quantifying Long-Range Interactions in Graph Machine Learning: a Large Graph Dataset and a Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09008v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-range dependencies are critical for effective graph representation learning, yet most existing datasets focus on small graphs tailored to inductive tasks, offering limited insight into long-range interactions. Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city road networks. This dataset features graphs with over 100k nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs based on local node eccentricities, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement-particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution-which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.</p></details> | work in progress |

By mining historical origin-to-destination flow patterns with spatial, temporal, and functional relations among urban places, we estimate probabilities of visits from neighborhoods to specific destinations. These probabilities capture neighborhood-level contributions to citywide vehicular and foot traffic, supporting demand estimation, accessibility assessment, and multimodal planning. Particularly, we introduce VisitHGNN, a heterogeneous, relation-specific graph neural network designed to predict visit probabilities at individual Points of interest (POIs). POIs are characterized using numerical, JSON-derived, and textual attributes, augmented with fixed summaries of POI--POI spatial proximity, temporal co-activity, and brand affinity, while census block groups (CBGs) are described with 72 socio-demographic variables. CBGs are connected via spatial adjacency, and POIs and CBGs are linked through distance-annotated cross-type edges. Inference is constrained to a distance-based candidate set of plausible origin CBGs, and training minimizes a masked Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to yield probability distribution across the candidate set. Using weekly mobility data from Fulton County, Georgia, USA, VisitHGNN achieves strong predictive performance with mean KL divergence of 0.287, MAE of 0.008, Top-1 accuracy of 0.853, and R-square of 0.892, substantially outperforming pairwise MLP and distance-only baselines, and aligning closely with empirical visitation patterns (NDCG@50 = 0.966); Recall@5 = 0.611). The resulting distributions closely mirror observed travel behavior with high fidelity, highlighting the model's potential for decision support in urban planning, transportation policy, mobility system design, and public health.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

These individuals contribute to the spread of the epidemic and pose a significant challenge to public health policies. Identifying asymptomatic individuals is critical for measuring and controlling an epidemic, but periodic and widespread testing of healthy individuals is often too costly. This work tackles the problem of identifying asymptomatic individuals considering a classic SI (Susceptible-Infected) network epidemic model where a fraction of the infected nodes are not observed as infected (i.e., their observed state is identical to susceptible nodes). In order to classify healthy nodes as asymptomatic or susceptible, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with supervised learning is adopted where a set of node features are built from the network with observed infected nodes. The approach is evaluated across different network models, network sizes, and fraction of observed infections. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is robust across different scenarios, accurately identifying asymptomatic nodes while also generalizing to different network sizes and fraction of observed infections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper presented in the 35th Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems (BRACIS)</p></details> |
| **[On The Expressive Power of GNN Derivatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02565v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN (HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture. Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism. Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong performance on popular graph learning tasks.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides a powerful lens into large-scale functional connectivity, where brain regions are modeled as nodes and inter-regional synchrony as edges, offering clinically relevant biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. While prior works use graph neural network (GNN) approaches for disorder prediction, they remain complex black-boxes, limiting their reliability and clinical translation. In this work, we propose CONCEPTNEURO, a concept-based diagnosis framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and neurobiological domain knowledge to automatically generate, filter, and encode interpretable functional connectivity concepts. Each concept is represented as a structured subgraph linking specific brain regions, which are then passed through a concept classifier. Our design ensures predictions through clinically meaningful connectivity patterns, enabling both interpretability and strong predictive performance. Extensive experiments across multiple psychiatric disorder datasets demonstrate that CONCEPTNEURO-augmented GNNs consistently outperform their vanilla counterparts, improving accuracy while providing transparent, clinically aligned explanations. Furthermore, concept analyses highlight disorder-specific connectivity patterns that align with expert knowledge and suggest new hypotheses for future investigation, establishing CONCEPTNEURO as an interpretable, domain-informed framework for psychiatric disorder diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

We propose a heterogeneous graph representation of stiffened panels that accounts for geometrical variability, non-uniform boundary conditions, and diverse loading scenarios, using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The structure is partitioned into multiple structural units, such as stiffeners and the plates between them, with each unit represented by three distinct node types: geometry, boundary, and loading nodes. Edge heterogeneity is introduced by incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting nodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees of heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are implemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises stress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and degrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams composed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The heterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart, demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, an ablation analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of graph heterogeneity on HGT performance. The results show strong predictive accuracy for both displacement and von Mises stress, effectively capturing structural behavior patterns and maximum values.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint and has been submitted to Engineering with Computers</p></details> |

The proper evaluation of traffic forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformers Discover Molecular Structure Without Graph Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02259v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25 dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures for molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |

The problem is challenging in decentralized settings with robots that have limited communication and sensing capabilities. We propose a learnable Perception-Action-Communication (LPAC) architecture for the problem, wherein a convolutional neural network (CNN) processes localized perception; a graph neural network (GNN) facilitates robot communications; finally, a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) computes robot actions. The GNN enables collaboration in the robot swarm by computing what information to communicate with nearby robots and how to incorporate received information. Evaluations show that the LPAC models -- trained using imitation learning -- outperform standard decentralized and centralized coverage control algorithms. The learned policy generalizes to environments different from the training dataset, transfers to larger environments with more robots, and is robust to noisy position estimates. The results indicate the suitability of LPAC architectures for decentralized navigation in robot swarms to achieve collaborative behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, 20 figures, Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM \textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

While prior GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies, revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement (RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent, diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Detecting LLM-Generated Spam Reviews by Integrating Language Model Embeddings and Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01801v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets, a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FraudSquad-5389/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Bundling with Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Inference on Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17599v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been used in many zero-shot learning problems, with their strong generalization ability. Recently, adopting LLMs in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has drawn increasing attention. However, the adoption of LLMs faces two major challenges: limited information on graph structure and unreliable responses. LLMs struggle with text attributes isolated from the graph topology. Worse still, they yield unreliable predictions due to both information insufficiency and the inherent weakness of LLMs (e.g., hallucination). Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel method named Dynamic Text Bundling Supervision (DENSE) that queries LLMs with bundles of texts to obtain bundle-level labels and uses these labels to supervise graph neural networks. Specifically, we sample a set of bundles, each containing a set of nodes with corresponding texts of close proximity. We then query LLMs with the bundled texts to obtain the label of each bundle. Subsequently, the bundle labels are used to supervise the optimization of graph neural networks, and the bundles are further refined to exclude noisy items. To justify our design, we also provide theoretical analysis of the proposed method. Extensive experiments across ten datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Recent advances, especially graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods, have significantly improved clustering performance. However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps: (1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance. Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that scSiameseClu outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell clustering, cell type annotation, and cell type classification, providing a powerful tool for scRNA-seq data interpretation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages causal dynamics to achieve effective fMRI-based subject and task fingerprinting. Methods: By applying an implicit-explicit discretization scheme, we develop a two-timescale linear state-space model. Through data-driven identification of its parameters, the model captures causal signatures, including directed interactions among brain regions from a spatial perspective, and disentangled fast and slow dynamic modes of brain activity from a temporal perspective. These causal signatures are then integrated with: (i) a modal decomposition and projection method for model-based subject identification, and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for learning-based task classification. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the brain reachability landscape as a novel visualization tool, which quantitatively characterizes the maximum possible activation levels of brain regions under various fMRI tasks. Results: We evaluate the proposed approach using the Human Connectome Project dataset and demonstrate its advantage over non-causality-based methods. The obtained causal signatures are visualized and demonstrate clear biological relevance with established understandings of brain function. Conclusion: We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing brain causal signatures for subject and task fingerprinting. Additionally, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.</p></details> |  |

Integrating physical laws with graph neural networks facilitates principled modeling of complex N-body dynamics and yields accurate and permutation-invariant models. However, training graph neural networks with iterative, gradient-based optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSProp, LBFGS) often leads to slow training, especially for large, complex systems. In comparison to 15 different optimizers, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN) can be trained up to 600x faster--but with comparable accuracy--by replacing iterative optimization with random feature-based parameter construction. We show robust performance in diverse simulations, including N-body mass-spring and molecular systems in up to 3 dimensions and 10,000 particles with different geometries, while retaining essential physical invariances with respect to permutation, rotation, and translation. Our proposed approach is benchmarked using a NeurIPS 2022 Datasets and Benchmarks Track publication to further demonstrate its versatility. We reveal that even when trained on minimal 8-node systems, the model can generalize in a zero-shot manner to systems as large as 4096 nodes without retraining. Our work challenges the dominance of iterative gradient-descent-based optimization algorithms for training neural network models for physical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, and an appendix</p></details> |

Yet, standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often struggle with architecture-specific limitations, data scarcity, and diverse naming conventions. We present AGNOMIN, a novel architecture-agnostic approach for multi-label function name prediction in stripped binaries. AGNOMIN builds Feature-Enriched Hierarchical Graphs (FEHGs), combining Control Flow Graphs, Function Call Graphs, and dynamically learned \texttt{PCode} features. A hierarchical graph neural network processes this enriched structure to generate consistent function representations across architectures, vital for \textbf{scalable security assessments}. For function name prediction, AGNOMIN employs a Ren\'ee-inspired decoder, enhanced with an attention-based head layer and algorithmic improvements. We evaluate AGNOMIN on a comprehensive dataset of 9,000 ELF executable binaries across three architectures, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with improvements of up to 27.17\% in precision and 55.86\% in recall across the testing dataset. Moreover, AGNOMIN generalizes well to unseen architectures, achieving 5.89\% higher recall than the closest baseline. AGNOMIN's practical utility has been validated through security hackathons, where it successfully aided reverse engineers in analyzing and patching vulnerable binaries across different architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchy-Aware Neural Subgraph Matching with Enhanced Similarity Measure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00402v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions. Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability, scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency, offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph retrieval.

To address this, we introduce MUSE-Explainer, a new method that helps reveal how music Graph Neural Network models make decisions by providing clear, human-friendly explanations. Our approach generates counterfactual explanations by making small, meaningful changes to musical score graphs that alter a model's prediction while ensuring the results remain musically coherent. Unlike existing methods, MUSE-Explainer tailors its explanations to the structure of musical data and avoids unrealistic or confusing outputs.

While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model (RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet. Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.</p></details> |  |

Despite the availability of diverse search-based and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge, algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system, MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters, offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third, rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200 protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short paper.

We introduce a novel risk-aggregated formulation of the complex WSR maximization problem, which utilizes the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a functional for enforcing rate (ultra)-reliability over channel fading uncertainty/risk. We establish a WMMSE-like equivalence between the proposed precoding problem and a weighted risk-averse MSE problem, enabling us to design a tailored unfolded graph neural network (GNN) policy function approximation (PFA), named {\alpha}-Robust Graph Neural Network ({\alpha}RGNN), trained to maximize lower-tail (CVaR) rates resulting from adverse wireless channel realizations (e.g., deep fading, attenuation). We empirically demonstrate that a trained {\alpha}RGNN fully eliminates per user deep rate fades, and substantially and optimally reduces statistical user rate variability while retaining adequate ergodic performance.</p></details> |  |

Despite its potential, traditional clustering methods in scRNA-seq data analysis often neglect the structural information embedded in gene expression profiles, crucial for understanding cellular correlations and dependencies. Existing strategies, including graph neural networks, face challenges in handling the inefficiency due to scRNA-seq data's intrinsic high-dimension and high-sparsity. Addressing these limitations, we introduce scCDCG (single-cell RNA-seq Clustering via Deep Cut-informed Graph), a novel framework designed for efficient and accurate clustering of scRNA-seq data that simultaneously utilizes intercellular high-order structural information. scCDCG comprises three main components: (i) A graph embedding module utilizing deep cut-informed techniques, which effectively captures intercellular high-order structural information, overcoming the over-smoothing and inefficiency issues prevalent in prior graph neural network methods. (ii) A self-supervised learning module guided by optimal transport, tailored to accommodate the unique complexities of scRNA-seq data, specifically its high-dimension and high-sparsity. (iii) An autoencoder-based feature learning module that simplifies model complexity through effective dimension reduction and feature extraction. Our extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrate scCDCG's superior performance and efficiency compared to 7 established models, underscoring scCDCG's potential as a transformative tool in scRNA-seq data analysis.

| **[Stealthy Yet Effective: Distribution-Preserving Backdoor Attacks on Graph Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26032v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework DGL to analyze and forecast industrial CO_2 emissions, addressing high feature correlation and capturing industrial-temporal interdependencies. Unlike traditional regression or clustering methods, our approach leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with attention mechanisms to model relationships between industries (or regions) and a temporal transformer to learn long-range patterns. We evaluate our framework on public global industry emissions dataset derived from EDGAR v8.0, spanning multiple countries and sectors. The proposed model achieves superior predictive performance - reducing error by over 15% compared to baseline deep models - while maintaining interpretability via attention weights and causal analysis. We believe that we are the first Graph-Temporal architecture that resolves multicollinearity by structurally encoding feature relationships, along with integration of causal inference to identify true drivers of emissions, improving transparency and fairness. We also stand a demonstration of policy relevance, showing how model insights can guide sector-specific decarbonization strategies aligned with sustainable development goals. Based on the above, we show high-emission "hotspots" and suggest equitable intervention plans, illustrating the potential of state-of-the-art AI graph learning to advance climate action, offering a powerful tool for policymakers and industry stakeholders to achieve carbon reduction targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 AI for Science Workshop</p></details> |

However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods utilize graph neural networks to model user intention in a unified manner, which inadequately considers the heterogeneity across different behaviors. Especially, high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors may implicitly contain noisy signals, and frequent patterns that are plausible while misleading, thereby hindering the learning of user intentions. To this end, this paper proposes a novel multi-behavior recommendation method, HiFIRec, that corrects the effect of high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors by differential behavior modeling. To revise the noisy signals, we hierarchically suppress it across layers by extracting neighborhood information through layer-wise neighborhood aggregation and further capturing user intentions through adaptive cross-layer feature fusion. To correct plausible frequent patterns, we propose an intensity-aware non-sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the weights of negative samples. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show that HiFIRec relatively improves HR@10 by 4.21%-6.81% over several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL) framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN) algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |

As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular, we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task during training.</p></details> |  |

The recent integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has further enhanced prediction accuracy in contemporary social recommendation algorithms. However, many GNN-based approaches in social recommendation lack the ability to furnish meaningful explanations for their predictions. In this study, we confront this challenge by introducing SoREX, a self-explanatory GNN-based social recommendation framework. SoREX adopts a two-tower framework enhanced by friend recommendation, independently modeling social relations and user-item interactions, while jointly optimizing an auxiliary task to reinforce social signals. To offer explanations, we propose a novel ego-path extraction approach. This method involves transforming the ego-net of a target user into a collection of multi-hop ego-paths, from which we extract factor-specific and candidate-aware ego-path subsets as explanations. This process facilitates the summarization of detailed comparative explanations among different candidate items through intricate substructure analysis. Furthermore, we conduct explanation re-aggregation to explicitly correlate explanations with downstream predictions, imbuing our framework with inherent self-explainability. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four widely adopted benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of SoREX in predictive accuracy. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative analyses confirm the efficacy of the extracted explanations in SoREX.

An essential part of the ViG framework is the node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to prior vision GNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV submission. 13 pages, including the main text (8 pages), references, and supplementary material</p></details> |

Despite their promise and impressive results across the natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural networks to base the generation process on local environmental information, while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies. Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one thousand atoms. The trained Boltzmann Generators produce highly accurate equilibrium ensembles for various crystal structures, as well as Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies across a range of system sizes, able to reach scales where finite-size effects become negligible.</p></details> |  |
| **[GESA: Graph-Enhanced Semantic Allocation for Generalized, Fair, and Explainable Candidate-Role Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25435v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, fair, and explainable allocation of candidates to roles represents a fundamental challenge across multiple domains including corporate hiring, academic admissions, fellowship awards, and volunteer placement systems. Current state-of-the-art approaches suffer from semantic inflexibility, persistent demographic bias, opacity in decision-making processes, and poor scalability under dynamic policy constraints. We present GESA (Graph-Enhanced Semantic Allocation), a comprehensive framework that addresses these limitations through the integration of domain-adaptive transformer embeddings, heterogeneous self-supervised graph neural networks, adversarial debiasing mechanisms, multi-objective genetic optimization, and explainable AI components. Our experimental evaluation on large-scale international benchmarks comprising 20,000 candidate profiles and 3,000 role specifications demonstrates superior performance with 94.5% top-3 allocation accuracy, 37% improvement in diversity representation, 0.98 fairness score across demographic categories, and sub-second end-to-end latency. Additionally, GESA incorporates hybrid recommendation capabilities and glass-box explainability, making it suitable for deployment across diverse international contexts in industry, academia, and non-profit sectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Vulnerabilities in Temporal Graph Neural Networks via Strategic High-Impact Assaults](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25418v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks, communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic, easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection (to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT) demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Informed Inductive Biases for Voltage Prediction in Distribution Grids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25158v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii) complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation. Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Dynamic Image Graph Construction on FPGA for Vision GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25121v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Graph Neural Networks (Vision GNNs, or ViGs) represent images as unstructured graphs, achieving state of the art performance in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. Dynamic Image Graph Construction (DIGC) builds image graphs by connecting patches (nodes) based on feature similarity, and is dynamically repeated in each ViG layer following GNN based patch (node) feature updates. However, DIGC constitutes over 50% of end to end ViG inference latency, rising to 95% at high image resolutions, making it the dominant computational bottleneck. While hardware acceleration holds promise, prior works primarily optimize graph construction algorithmically, often compromising DIGC flexibility, accuracy, or generality. To address these limitations, we propose a streaming, deeply pipelined FPGA accelerator for DIGC, featuring on chip buffers that process input features in small, uniform blocks. Our design minimizes external memory traffic via localized computation and performs efficient parallel sorting with local merge sort and global k way merging directly on streaming input blocks via heap insertion. This modular architecture scales seamlessly across image resolutions, ViG layer types, and model sizes and variants, and supports DIGC across diverse ViG based vision backbones. The design achieves high clock frequencies post place and route due to the statically configured parallelism minimizing critical path delay and delivers up to 16.6x and 6.8x speedups over optimized CPU and GPU DIGC baselines.</p></details> | IEEE HPEC 2025 |
| **[A Graph-in-Graph Learning Framework for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11757v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is pivotal for advancing drug discovery and target validation techniques. While machine learning approaches including those that are based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have achieved notable success in DTI prediction, many of them have difficulties in effectively integrating the diverse features of drugs, targets and their interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework to take advantage of the power of both transductive learning and inductive learning so that features at molecular level and drug-target interaction network level can be exploited. Within this framework is a GNN-based model called Graph-in-Graph (GiG) that represents graphs of drug and target molecular structures as meta-nodes in a drug-target interaction graph, enabling a detailed exploration of their intricate relationships. To evaluate the proposed model, we have compiled a special benchmark comprising drug SMILES, protein sequences, and their interaction data, which is interesting in its own right. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GiG model significantly outperforms existing approaches across all evaluation metrics, highlighting the benefits of integrating different learning paradigms and interaction data.</p></details> |  |
| **[A GREAT Architecture for Edge-Based Graph Problems Like TSP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16717v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the last years, an increasing number of learning-based approaches have been proposed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems such as routing problems. Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, such models are ill-suited for a wide range of real-world problems that feature non-Euclidean and asymmetric edge costs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based and edge-focused neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). Using GREAT as an encoder to capture the properties of a routing problem instance, we build a reinforcement learning framework which we apply to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean variants of vehicle routing problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem, Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and Orienteering Problem. Our framework is among the first to tackle non-Euclidean variants of these problems and achieves competitive results among learning-based benchmarks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

To enhance handover (HO) performance, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handover (CHO) and Layer 1/Layer 2 Triggered Mobility (LTM) mechanisms in 5G. While these reactive HO strategies address the trade-off between HO failures (HOF) and ping-pong effects, they often result in inefficient radio resource utilization due to additional HO preparations. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a proactive HO framework for mobility management in O-RAN, leveraging user-cell link predictions to identify the optimal target cell for HO. We explore various categories of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for link prediction and analyze the complexity of applying them to the mobility management domain. Two GNN models are compared using a real-world dataset, with experimental results demonstrating their ability to capture the dynamic and graph-structured nature of cellular networks. Finally, we present key insights from our study and outline future steps to enable the integration of GNN-based link prediction for mobility management in O-RAN networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table.

| **[Adaptive Canonicalization with Application to Invariant Anisotropic Geometric Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24886v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning, enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form. Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing \emph{adaptive canonicalization}, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that admit universal approximation properties. We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and equivariant architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[ELPG-DTFS: Prior-Guided Adaptive Time-Frequency Graph Neural Network for EEG Depression Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24860v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital, yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35, confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.</p></details> | 8 page,3 figures |
| **[Beyond Softmax: A Natural Parameterization for Categorical Random Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24728v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1) revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the $\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$ is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases. Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\textit{softmax}$ function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Community detection robustness of graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24662v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly widely used for community detection in attributed networks. They combine structural topology with node attributes through message passing and pooling. However, their robustness or lack of thereof with respect to different perturbations and targeted attacks in conjunction with community detection tasks is not well understood. To shed light into latent mechanisms behind GNN sensitivity on community detection tasks, we conduct a systematic computational evaluation of six widely adopted GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, Graph-SAGE, DiffPool, MinCUT, and DMoN. The analysis covers three perturbation categories: node attribute manipulations, edge topology distortions, and adversarial attacks. We use element-centric similarity as the evaluation metric on synthetic benchmarks and real-world citation networks. Our findings indicate that supervised GNNs tend to achieve higher baseline accuracy, while unsupervised methods, particularly DMoN, maintain stronger resilience under targeted and adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, robustness appears to be strongly influenced by community strength, with well-defined communities reducing performance loss. Across all models, node attribute perturbations associated with targeted edge deletions and shift in attribute distributions tend to cause the largest degradation in community recovery. These findings highlight important trade-offs between accuracy and robustness in GNN-based community detection and offer new insights into selecting architectures resilient to noise and adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

This review provides a comprehensive overview of smart, machine learning (ML)-driven approaches, emphasizing their role in predicting material properties, discovering novel compounds, and optimizing material structures. Key methodologies in this field include deep learning, graph neural networks, Bayesian optimization, and automated generative models (GANs, VAEs). These approaches enable the autonomous design of materials with tailored functionalities. By leveraging AutoML frameworks (AutoGluon, TPOT, and H2O.ai), researchers can automate the model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, significantly improving the efficiency of materials informatics. Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven robotic laboratories and high-throughput computing has established a fully automated pipeline for rapid synthesis and experimental validation, drastically reducing the time and cost of material discovery. This review highlights real-world applications of automated ML-driven approaches in predicting mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of materials, demonstrating successful cases in superconductors, catalysts, photovoltaics, and energy storage systems. We also address key challenges, such as data quality, interpretability, and the integration of AutoML with quantum computing, which are essential for future advancements. Ultimately, combining AI with automated experimentation and computational modeling is transforming the way materials are discovered and optimized. This synergy paves the way for new innovations in energy, electronics, and nanotechnology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting Robot Teams with Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24575v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a framework towards prompting multi-robot teams with high-level tasks using natural language expressions. Our objective is to use the reasoning capabilities demonstrated by recent language models in understanding and decomposing human expressions of intent, and repurpose these for multi-robot collaboration and decision-making. The key challenge is that an individual's behavior in a collective can be hard to specify and interpret, and must continuously adapt to actions from others. This necessitates a framework that possesses the representational capacity required by the logic and semantics of a task, and yet supports decentralized and interactive real-time operation. We solve this dilemma by recognizing that a task can be represented as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can encode numerous automata. This allows us to distill the logic and sequential decompositions of sub-tasks obtained from a language model into an RNN, and align its internal states with the semantics of a given task. By training a graph neural network (GNN) control policy that is conditioned on the hidden states of the RNN and the language embeddings, our method enables robots to execute task-relevant actions in a decentralized manner. We present evaluations of this single light-weight interpretable model on various simulated and real-world multi-robot tasks that require sequential and collaborative behavior by the team -- sites.google.com/view/prompting-teams.</p></details> |  |

This limitation arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight, adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Joint Conference on Knowledge Graphs</p></details> |
| **[Graph-Based Learning of Free Surface Dynamics in Generalized Newtonian Fluids using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24264v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) model for efficiently predicting the flow behavior of non-Newtonian fluids with free surface dynamics. The numerical analysis of non-Newtonian fluids presents significant challenges, as traditional algorithms designed for Newtonian fluids with constant viscosity often struggle to converge when applied to non-Newtonian cases, where rheological properties vary dynamically with flow conditions. Among these, power-law fluids exhibit viscosity that decreases exponentially as the shear rate increases, making numerical simulations particularly difficult. The complexity further escalates in free surface flow scenarios, where computational challenges intensify. In such cases, particle-based methods like smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) provide advantages over traditional grid-based techniques, such as the finite element method (FEM). Building on this approach, we introduce a novel GNN-based numerical model to enhance the computational efficiency of non-Newtonian power-law fluid flow simulations. Our model is trained on SPH simulation data, learning the effects of particle accelerations in the presence of SPH interactions based on the fluid's power-law parameters. The GNN significantly accelerates computations while maintaining reliable accuracy in benchmark tests, including dam-break and droplet impact simulations. The results underscore the potential of GNN-based simulation frameworks for efficiently modeling non-Newtonian fluid behavior, paving the way for future advancements in data-driven fluid simulations.</p></details> |  |

Unlike standard DiD methods, the proposed approach explicitly accommodates treatment spillovers and high-dimensional network confounding arising from complex inter-unit dependencies. Identification relies on a conditional parallel-trends assumption that holds after adjusting for high-dimensional network confounders. The estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal as the network size increases, and we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate nuisance functions. Simulation studies and an empirical application to U.S. county-level mask mandates and their impact on COVID-19 transmission demonstrate favorable finite-sample performance, addressing limitations of conventional DiD methods that ignore network interference.</p></details> |  |

First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However, these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 to...</summary><p>14 total pages of main content, 4 of references, 3 in Appendix</p></details> |

State-of-the-art models are generally graph neural networks that employ message passing to iteratively update atomic embeddings that are ultimately used for predicting properties. In this work we extend the message passing formalism with the inclusion of a continuous variable that accounts for fractional atomic existence. This allows us to calculate the gradient of the Gibbs free energy with respect to both the Cartesian coordinates of atoms and their existence. Using this we propose a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method and document its capabilities for a Cu(110) surface oxide.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00647v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sheaf diffusion has recently emerged as a promising design pattern for graph representation learning due to its inherent ability to handle heterophilic data and avoid oversmoothing. Meanwhile, cooperative message passing has also been proposed as a way to enhance the flexibility of information diffusion by allowing nodes to independently choose whether to propagate/gather information from/to neighbors. A natural question ensues: is sheaf diffusion capable of exhibiting this cooperative behavior? Here, we provide a negative answer to this question. In particular, we show that existing sheaf diffusion methods fail to achieve cooperative behavior due to the lack of message directionality. To circumvent this limitation, we introduce the notion of cellular sheaves over directed graphs and characterize their in- and out-degree Laplacians. We leverage our construction to propose Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs). Theoretically, we characterize the receptive field of CSNN and show it allows nodes to selectively attend (listen) to arbitrarily far nodes while ignoring all others in their path, potentially mitigating oversquashing. Our experiments show that CSNN presents overall better performance compared to prior art on sheaf diffusion as well as cooperative graph neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Neural Networks to Logical Theories: The Correspondence between Fibring Modal Logics and Fibring Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23912v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the (pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models \emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders. Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks with the tools of computational logic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta Pruning via Graph Metanetworks : A Universal Meta Learning Framework for Network Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12041v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an entirely new meta-learning framework for network pruning. It is a general framework that can be theoretically applied to almost all types of networks with all kinds of pruning and has great generality and transferability. Experiments have shown that it can achieve outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including both CNNs and Transformers). Unlike all prior works that either rely on fixed, hand-crafted criteria to prune in a coarse manner, or employ learning to prune ways that require special training during each pruning and lack generality. Our framework can learn complex pruning rules automatically via a neural network (metanetwork) and has great generality that can prune without any special training. More specifically, we introduce the newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning strategy automatically and can transform a network that is hard to prune into another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained, our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and some standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yewei-Liu/MetaPruning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-time GNN Model Evaluation on Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23816v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Homophily in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23773v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Modality-Tailored Graph Modeling Framework for Urban Region Representation via Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23772v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1) They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element, remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Final Layer Holds the Key: A Unified and Efficient GNN Calibration Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11335v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness on graph-based tasks. However, their predictive confidence is often miscalibrated, typically exhibiting under-confidence, which harms the reliability of their decisions. Existing calibration methods for GNNs normally introduce additional calibration components, which fail to capture the intrinsic relationship between the model and the prediction confidence, resulting in limited theoretical guarantees and increased computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet efficient graph calibration method. We establish a unified theoretical framework revealing that model confidence is jointly governed by class-centroid-level and node-level calibration at the final layer. Based on this insight, we theoretically show that reducing the weight decay of the final-layer parameters alleviates GNN under-confidence by acting on the class-centroid level, while node-level calibration acts as a finer-grained complement to class-centroid level calibration, which encourages each test node to be closer to its predicted class centroid at the final-layer representations. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks with Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23671v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN). DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore, a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pure Node Selection for Imbalanced Graph Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23662v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones.

| **[Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Efficient Long-Range Information Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23660v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphIFE: Rethinking Graph Imbalance Node Classification via Invariant Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23616v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The class imbalance problem refers to the disproportionate distribution of samples across different classes within a dataset, where the minority classes are significantly underrepresented. This issue is also prevalent in graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms various baselines across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/flzeng1/GraphIFE.</p></details> | <details><summary>PrePr...</summary><p>PrePrint, 16 pages, 7 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Equivariant Spherical Transformer for Efficient Molecular Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23086v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced the modeling of 3D molecular structure by leveraging group representations. However, their message passing, heavily relying on Clebsch-Gordan tensor product convolutions, suffers from restricted expressiveness due to the limited non-linearity and low degree of group representations. To overcome this, we introduce the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel plug-and-play framework that applies a Transformer-like architecture to the Fourier spatial domain of group representations. EST achieves higher expressiveness than conventional models while preserving the crucial equivariant inductive bias through a uniform sampling strategy of spherical Fourier transforms. As demonstrated by our experiments on challenging benchmarks like OC20 and QM9, EST-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance. For the complex molecular systems within OC20, small models empowered by EST can outperform some larger models and those using additional data. In addition to demonstrating such strong expressiveness,we provide both theoretical and experimental validation of EST's equivariance as well, paving the way for new research in this area.</p></details> | 26 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Scalable Graph Generative Modeling via Substructure Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16130v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been predominantly driven by message-passing, where node representations are iteratively updated via local neighborhood aggregation. Despite their success, message-passing suffers from fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness, over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model size often fails to yield improved performance. To this end, we explore pathways beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine (G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn generalizable and transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse tasks -- including node/link/graph classification, transfer learning, and cross-graph pretraining -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a compelling foundation for scalable graph learning.

Compared to most existing solutions, the proposed method does not require prior knowledge of the number of communities. It enhances the Louvain algorithm using node embeddings generated by a GNN to capture richer structural and feature information. Furthermore, it introduces a merging algorithm to refine the results of the enhanced Louvain algorithm, reducing the number of detected communities. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one that improves the Louvain algorithm using GNNs for community detection. The improvement of the proposed method was empirically confirmed through an evaluation on real-world datasets. The results demonstrate its ability to dynamically adjust the number of detected communities and increase the detection accuracy in comparison with the benchmark solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in ICMLT 2025 conference proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Flow-Attentional Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06127v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for learning from graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs do not consider the conservation law inherent in graphs associated with a flow of physical resources, such as electrical current in power grids or traffic in transportation networks, which can lead to reduced model performance. To address this, we propose flow attention, which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy Kirchhoff$\text{'}$s first law. Furthermore, we discuss how this modification influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention. Through extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power grids) we demonstrate that flow attention enhances the performance of attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted @ Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR): https://openreview.net/forum?id=tOzg7UxTPD</p></details> |
| **[Towards Quantum-Ready Blockchain Fraud Detection via Ensemble Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23101v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure, decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection. Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[GuardNet: Graph-Attention Filtering for Jailbreak Defense in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23037v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which are adversarial prompts that bypass alignment constraints and induce unauthorized or harmful behaviors. These vulnerabilities undermine the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and (ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans. Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\% on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to 74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity, GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats in real-world LLM deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[OptimES: Optimizing Federated Learning Using Remote Embeddings for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22922v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have experienced rapid advancements in recent years due to their ability to learn meaningful representations from graph data structures. However, in most real-world settings, such as financial transaction networks and healthcare networks, this data is localized to different data owners and cannot be aggregated due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a viable machine learning approach for training a shared model that iteratively aggregates local models trained on decentralized data. This addresses privacy concerns while leveraging parallelism. State-of-the-art methods enhance the privacy-respecting convergence accuracy of federated GNN training by sharing remote embeddings of boundary vertices through a server (EmbC). However, they are limited by diminished performance due to large communication costs. In this article, we propose OptimES, an optimized federated GNN training framework that employs remote neighbourhood pruning, overlapping the push of embeddings to the server with local training, and dynamic pulling of embeddings to reduce network costs and training time. We perform a rigorous evaluation of these strategies for four common graph datasets with up to $111M$ vertices and $1.8B$ edges. We see that a modest drop in per-round accuracy due to the preemptive push of embeddings is out-stripped by the reduction in per-round training time for large and dense graphs like Reddit and Products, converging up to $\approx 3.5\times$ faster than EmbC and giving up to $\approx16\%$ better accuracy than the default federated GNN learning. While accuracy improvements over default federated GNNs are modest for sparser graphs like Arxiv and Papers, they achieve the target accuracy about $\approx11\times$ faster than EmbC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended full-length version of paper that appeared at Euro-Par 2024: "Optimizing Federated Learning Using Remote Embeddings for Graph Neural Networks", Pranjal Naman and Yogesh Simmhan, in International European Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing (Euro-Par), 2024.

| **[Lexicon-Enriched Graph Modeling for Arabic Document Readability Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22870v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a graph-based approach enriched with lexicons to predict document-level readability in Arabic, developed as part of the Constrained Track of the BAREC Shared Task 2025. Our system models each document as a sentence-level graph, where nodes represent sentences and lemmas, and edges capture linguistic relationships such as lexical co-occurrence and class membership. Sentence nodes are enriched with features from the SAMER lexicon as well as contextual embeddings from the Arabic transformer model. The graph neural network (GNN) and transformer sentence encoder are trained as two independent branches, and their predictions are combined via late fusion at inference. For document-level prediction, sentence-level outputs are aggregated using max pooling to reflect the most difficult sentence. Experimental results show that this hybrid method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches across multiple readability metrics. Overall, the findings highlight that fusion offers advantages at the document level, but the GNN-only approach remains stronger for precise prediction of sentence-level readability.</p></details> |  |
