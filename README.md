| **[A Framework for Personalized Persuasiveness Prediction via Context-Aware User Profiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05654v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the persuasiveness of messages is critical in various applications, from recommender systems to safety assessment of LLMs. While it is imperative to consider the target persuadee's characteristics, such as their values, experiences, and reasoning styles, there is currently no established systematic framework to optimize leveraging a persuadee's past activities (e.g., conversations) to the benefit of a persuasiveness prediction model. To address this problem, we propose a context-aware user profiling framework with two trainable components: a query generator that generates optimal queries to retrieve persuasion-relevant records from a user's history, and a profiler that summarizes these records into a profile to effectively inform the persuasiveness prediction model. Our evaluation on the ChangeMyView Reddit dataset shows consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple predictor models, with gains of up to +13.77%p in F1 score. Further analysis shows that effective user profiles are context-dependent and predictor-specific, rather than relying on static attributes or surface-level similarity. Together, these results highlight the importance of task-oriented, context-dependent user profiling for personalized persuasiveness prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causal Information-Flow Framework for Unbiased Learning-to-Rank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05590v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In web search and recommendation systems, user clicks are widely used to train ranking models. However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation. Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show that our method consistently reduces measured bias leakage and improves ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases-such as position and trust bias-interact strongly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Macro Graph of Experts for Billion-Scale Multi-Task Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10520v4)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs. Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures, relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Experts (MGOE) framework, the first approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts. Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering multi-task learning for a leading billion-scale recommender system, Alibaba. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE in billion-scale recommender systems.</p></details> | Accepted to KDD2026 |
| **[Do LLMs Benefit from User and Item Embeddings in Recommendation Tasks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04690v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising recommendation systems, offering novel ways to model user preferences through generative approaches. However, many existing methods often rely solely on text semantics or incorporate collaborative signals in a limited manner, typically using only user or item embeddings. These methods struggle to handle multiple item embeddings representing user history, reverting to textual semantics and neglecting richer collaborative information. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective solution that projects user and item embeddings, learned from collaborative filtering, into the LLM token space via separate lightweight projector modules. A finetuned LLM then conditions on these projected embeddings alongside textual tokens to generate recommendations. Preliminary results show that this design effectively leverages structured user-item interaction data, improves recommendation performance over text-only LLM baselines, and offers a practical path for bridging traditional recommendation systems with modern LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Workshop at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[PROMISE: Process Reward Models Unlock Test-Time Scaling Laws in Generative Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04674v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, reformulating recommendation as a sequence-to-sequence generation task over hierarchical Semantic IDs. However, existing methods suffer from a critical issue we term Semantic Drift, where errors in early, high-level tokens irreversibly divert the generation trajectory into irrelevant semantic subspaces. Inspired by Process Reward Models (PRMs) that enhance reasoning in Large Language Models, we propose Promise, a novel framework that integrates dense, step-by-step verification into generative models. Promise features a lightweight PRM to assess the quality of intermediate inference steps, coupled with a PRM-guided Beam Search strategy that leverages dense feedback to dynamically prune erroneous branches. Crucially, our approach unlocks Test-Time Scaling Laws for recommender systems: by increasing inference compute, smaller models can match or surpass larger models. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests on a large-scale platform demonstrate that Promise effectively mitigates Semantic Drift, significantly improving recommendation accuracy while enabling efficient deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneVision: An End-to-End Generative Framework for Multi-view E-commerce Vision Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05759v4)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems, follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation. In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and +3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric, generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while simplifying the serving pathway.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCoTER: Structured Chain-of-Thought Transfer for Enhanced Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19514v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Harnessing the reasoning power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommender systems is hindered by two fundamental challenges. First, current approaches lack a mechanism for automated, data-driven discovery of effective reasoning patterns, relying instead on brittle manual templates or unstable zero-shot prompting. Second, they employ structure-collapsing integration: direct prompting incurs prohibitive online inference costs, while feature extraction collapses reasoning chains into single vectors, discarding stepwise logic. To address these challenges, we propose SCoTER (Structured Chain-of-Thought Transfer for Enhanced Recommendation), a unified framework that treats pattern discovery and structure-aware transfer as a jointly optimized problem. Specifically, SCoTER operationalizes this through two synergistic components: a GVM pipeline for automated pattern discovery and a structure-preserving integration architecture that transfers stepwise logic to efficient models. Formally, we provide information-theoretic justification proving that structure-preserving transfer achieves tighter performance bounds than structure-agnostic alternatives. Empirically, experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate improvements of 3.75\%-11.59\% over a strong TIGER backbone. Moreover, in production deployment on the Tencent Advertising Platform, SCoTER achieved a 2.14\% lift in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) while eliminating online LLM inference costs. Overall, SCoTER establishes a principled and production-validated blueprint for transferring structured LLM reasoning to large-scale recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to some internal company policies, we need to temporarily withdraw the paper.

| **[Exploring Recommender System Evaluation: A Multi-Modal User Agent Framework for A/B Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04554v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recommender systems, online A/B testing is a crucial method for evaluating the performance of different models. However, conducting online A/B testing often presents significant challenges, including substantial economic costs, user experience degradation, and considerable time requirements. With the Large Language Models' powerful capacity, LLM-based agent shows great potential to replace traditional online A/B testing. Nonetheless, current agents fail to simulate the perception process and interaction patterns, due to the lack of real environments and visual perception capability. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-modal user agent for A/B testing (A/B Agent). Specifically, we construct a recommendation sandbox environment for A/B testing, enabling multimodal and multi-page interactions that align with real user behavior on online platforms. The designed agent leverages multimodal information perception, fine-grained user preferences, and integrates profiles, action memory retrieval, and a fatigue system to simulate complex human decision-making. We validated the potential of the agent as an alternative to traditional A/B testing from three perspectives: model, data, and features. Furthermore, we found that the data generated by A/B Agent can effectively enhance the capabilities of recommendation models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/ABAgent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Membership Inference Attacks on Recommender System: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11080v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RecSys) have been widely applied to various applications, including E-commerce, finance, healthcare, social media and have become increasingly influential in shaping user behavior and decision-making, highlighting their growing impact in various domains. However, recent studies have shown that RecSys are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether user interaction record was used to train a target model or not. MIAs on RecSys models can directly lead to a privacy breach. For example, via identifying the fact that a purchase record that has been used to train a RecSys associated with a specific user, an attacker can infer that user's special quirks. In recent years, MIAs have been shown to be effective on other ML tasks, e.g., classification models and natural language processing. However, traditional MIAs are ill-suited for RecSys due to the unseen posterior probability. Although MIAs on RecSys form a newly emerging and rapidly growing research area, there has been no systematic survey on this topic yet. In this article, we conduct the first comprehensive survey on RecSys MIAs. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in RecSys MIAs, exploring the design principles, challenges, attack and defense associated with this emerging field. We provide a unified taxonomy that categorizes different RecSys MIAs based on their characterizations and discuss their pros and cons. Based on the limitations and gaps identified in this survey, we point out several promising future research directions to inspire the researchers who wish to follow this area. This survey not only serves as a reference for the research community but also provides a clear description for researchers outside this research domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review in ACM Survey</p></details> |
| **[Learning Multinomial Logits in $O(n \log n)$ time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04423v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Multinomial Logit (MNL) model is composed of a finite universe of items $[n]=\{1,..., n\}$, each assigned a positive weight. A query specifies an admissible subset -- called a slate -- and the model chooses one item from that slate with probability proportional to its weight. This query model is also known as the Plackett-Luce model or conditional sampling oracle in the literature. Although MNLs have been studied extensively, a basic computational question remains open: given query access to slates, how efficiently can we learn weights so that, for every slate, the induced choice distribution is within total variation distance $\varepsilon$ of the ground truth? This question is central to MNL learning and has direct implications for modern recommender system interfaces. We provide two algorithms for this task, one with adaptive queries and one with non-adaptive queries. Each algorithm outputs an MNL $M'$ that induces, for each slate $S$, a distribution $M'_S$ on $S$ that is within $\varepsilon$ total variation distance of the true distribution. Our adaptive algorithm makes $O\left(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^{3}}\log n\right)$ queries, while our non-adaptive algorithm makes $O\left(\frac{n^{2}}{\varepsilon^{3}}\log n \log\frac{n}{\varepsilon}\right)$ queries. Both algorithms query only slates of size two and run in time proportional to their query complexity. We complement these upper bounds with lower bounds of $Ω\left(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^{2}}\log n\right)$ for adaptive queries and $Ω\left(\frac{n^{2}}{\varepsilon^{2}}\log n\right)$ for non-adaptive queries, thus proving that our adaptive algorithm is optimal in its dependence on the support size $n$, while the non-adaptive one is tight within a $\log n$ factor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Integrated Transformers for Community Detection in Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04367v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Community detection is crucial for applications like targeted marketing and recommendation systems. Traditional methods rely on network structure, and embedding-based models integrate semantic information. However, there is a challenge when a model leverages local and global information from complex structures like social networks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers have shown superior performance in capturing local and global relationships. In this paper, We propose Graph Integrated Transformer for Community Detection (GIT-CD), a hybrid model combining GNNs and Transformer-based attention mechanisms to enhance community detection in social networks. Specifically, the GNN module captures local graph structures, while the Transformer module models long-range dependencies. A self-optimizing clustering module refines community assignments using K-Means, silhouette loss, and KL divergence minimization. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that GIT-CD outperforms state-of-the-art models, making it a robust approach for detecting meaningful communities in complex social networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at IEEE GLOBECOM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Behavioral Patterns in News Recommendations Using Fuzzy Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04019v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>News recommender systems are increasingly driven by black-box models, offering little transparency for editorial decision-making. In this work, we introduce a transparent recommender system that uses fuzzy neural networks to learn human-readable rules from behavioral data for predicting article clicks. By extracting the rules at configurable thresholds, we can control rule complexity and thus, the level of interpretability. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available news datasets (i.e., MIND and EB-NeRD) and show that we can accurately predict click behavior compared to several established baselines, while learning human-readable rules. Furthermore, we show that the learned rules reveal news consumption patterns, enabling editors to align content curation goals with target audience behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the IR for Good track at ECIR'26</p></details> |
| **[Correct and Weight: A Simple Yet Effective Loss for Implicit Feedback Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04291v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from implicit feedback has become the standard paradigm for modern recommender systems. However, this setting is fraught with the persistent challenge of false negatives, where unobserved user-item interactions are not necessarily indicative of negative preference. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel and principled loss function, named Corrected and Weighted (CW) loss, that systematically corrects for the impact of false negatives within the training objective. Our approach integrates two key techniques. First, inspired by Positive-Unlabeled learning, we debias the negative sampling process by re-calibrating the assumed negative distribution. By theoretically approximating the true negative distribution (p-) using the observable general data distribution (p) and the positive interaction distribution (p^+), our method provides a more accurate estimate of the likelihood that a sampled unlabeled item is truly negative. Second, we introduce a dynamic re-weighting mechanism that modulates the importance of each negative instance based on the model's current prediction. This scheme encourages the model to enforce a larger ranking margin between positive items and confidently predicted (i.e., easy) negative items, while simultaneously down-weighting the penalty on uncertain negatives that have a higher probability of being false negatives. A key advantage of our approach is its elegance and efficiency; it requires no complex modifications to the data sampling process or significant computational overhead, making it readily applicable to a wide array of existing recommendation models. Extensive experiments conducted on four large-scale, sparse benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed loss. The results show that our method consistently and significantly outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art loss functions across multiple ranking-oriented metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2508.05673 by other authors</p></details> |

We leverage a new capability on emerging decentralized social media platforms: the ability for anyone to build and deploy feeds for other users, to use just as they would a native platform-built feed. To our knowledge, Paper Skygest is the first and largest such continuously deployed personalized social media feed by academics, with over 50,000 weekly uses by over 1,000 daily active users, all organically acquired. First, we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate Paper Skygest usage, showing that it has sustained usage and satisfies users; we further show adoption of Paper Skygest increases a user's interactions with posts about research, and how interaction rates change as a function of post order. Second, we share our full code and describe our system architecture, to support other academics in building and deploying such feeds sustainably. Third, we overview the potential of custom feeds such as Paper Skygest for studying algorithm designs, building for user agency, and running recommender system experiments with organic users without partnering with a centralized platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[COFFEE: COdesign Framework for Feature Enriched Embeddings in Ads-Ranking Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02807v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diverse and enriched data sources are essential for commercial ads-recommendation models to accurately assess user interest both before and after engagement with content. While extended user-engagement histories can improve the prediction of user interests, it is equally important to embed activity sequences from multiple sources to ensure freshness of user and ad-representations, following scaling law principles. In this paper, we present a novel three-dimensional framework for enhancing user-ad representations without increasing model inference or serving complexity. The first dimension examines the impact of incorporating diverse event sources, the second considers the benefits of longer user histories, and the third focuses on enriching data with additional event attributes and multi-modal embeddings. We assess the return on investment (ROI) of our source enrichment framework by comparing organic user engagement sources, such as content viewing, with ad-impression sources. The proposed method can boost the area under curve (AUC) and the slope of scaling curves for ad-impression sources by 1.56 to 2 times compared to organic usage sources even for short online-sequence lengths of 100 to 10K. Additionally, click-through rate (CTR) prediction improves by 0.56% AUC over the baseline production ad-recommendation system when using enriched ad-impression event sources, leading to improved sequence scaling resolutions for longer and offline user-ad representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization for LLM-based User Simulators in Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12645v4)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled realistic user simulators for developing and evaluating recommender systems (RSs). However, existing LLM-based simulators for RSs face two major limitations: (1) static and single-step prompt-based inference that leads to inaccurate and incomplete user profile construction; (2) unrealistic and single-round recommendation-feedback interaction pattern that fails to capture real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DGDPO (Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization), a novel framework that constructs user profile through a dynamic and iterative optimization process to enhance the simulation fidelity. Specifically, DGDPO incorporates two core modules within each optimization loop: firstly, a specialized LLM-based diagnostic module, calibrated through our novel training strategy, accurately identifies specific defects in the user profile. Subsequently, a generalized LLM-based treatment module analyzes the diagnosed defect and generates targeted suggestions to refine the profile. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM-based user simulators that are limited to single-round interactions, we are the first to integrate DGDPO with sequential recommenders, enabling a bidirectional evolution where user profiles and recommendation strategies adapt to each other over multi-round interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Structured Driven Dual Adaptation for Mitigating Popularity Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23358v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popularity bias is a common challenge in recommender systems. It often causes unbalanced item recommendation performance and intensifies the Matthew effect. Due to limited user-item interactions, unpopular items are frequently constrained to the embedding neighborhoods of only a few users, leading to representation collapse and weakening the model's generalization. Although existing supervised alignment and reweighting methods can help mitigate this problem, they still face two major limitations: (1) they overlook the inherent variability among different Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) layers, which can result in negative gains in deeper layers; (2) they rely heavily on fixed hyperparameters to balance popular and unpopular items, limiting adaptability to diverse data distributions and increasing model complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-Structured Dual Adaptation Framework (GSDA), a dual adaptive framework for mitigating popularity bias in recommendation. Our theoretical analysis shows that supervised alignment in GCNs is hindered by the over-smoothing effect, where the distinction between popular and unpopular items diminishes as layers deepen, reducing the effectiveness of alignment at deeper levels. To overcome this limitation, GSDA integrates a hierarchical adaptive alignment mechanism that counteracts entropy decay across layers together with a distribution-aware contrastive weighting strategy based on the Gini coefficient, enabling the model to adapt its debiasing strength dynamically without relying on fixed hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GSDA effectively alleviates popularity bias while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods in recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |

A fundamental challenge in deploying sophisticated ML models for sequential decision-making is the lack of tractable concentration inequalities required for principled exploration. We overcome this limitation by directly modeling the learning curve behavior of the underlying estimator. Specifically, assuming the Mean Squared Error decreases as a power law in the number of training samples, we derive a generalized concentration inequality and prove that ML-UCB achieves sublinear regret. This framework enables the principled integration of any ML model whose learning curve can be empirically characterized, eliminating the need for model-specific theoretical analysis. We validate our approach through experiments on a collaborative filtering recommendation system using online matrix factorization with synthetic data designed to simulate a simplified two-tower model, demonstrating substantial improvements over LinUCB</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, Multi-Arm bandit, psi-UCB, generalized estimators</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Approaches for Detecting Memorization of Recommender System Data in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02002v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in recommendation scenarios due to their strong natural language understanding and generation capabilities. However, they are trained on vast corpora whose contents are not publicly disclosed, raising concerns about data leakage. Recent work has shown that the MovieLens-1M dataset is memorized by both the LLaMA and OpenAI model families, but the extraction of such memorized data has so far relied exclusively on manual prompt engineering. In this paper, we pose three main questions: Is it possible to enhance manual prompting? Can LLM memorization be detected through methods beyond manual prompting? And can the detection of data leakage be automated? To address these questions, we evaluate three approaches: (i) jailbreak prompt engineering; (ii) unsupervised latent knowledge discovery, probing internal activations via Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) and Cluster-Norm; and (iii) Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE), which frames prompt discovery as a meta-learning process that iteratively refines candidate instructions. Experiments on MovieLens-1M using LLaMA models show that jailbreak prompting does not improve the retrieval of memorized items and remains inconsistent; CCS reliably distinguishes genuine from fabricated movie titles but fails on numerical user and rating data; and APE retrieves item-level information with moderate success yet struggles to recover numerical interactions. These findings suggest that automatically optimizing prompts is the most promising strategy for extracting memorized samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Diversity, Novelty, and Popularity Bias in ChatGPT's Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01997v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ChatGPT has emerged as a versatile tool, demonstrating capabilities across diverse domains. Given these successes, the Recommender Systems (RSs) community has begun investigating its applications within recommendation scenarios primarily focusing on accuracy. While the integration of ChatGPT into RSs has garnered significant attention, a comprehensive analysis of its performance across various dimensions remains largely unexplored. Specifically, the capabilities of providing diverse and novel recommendations or exploring potential biases such as popularity bias have not been thoroughly examined. As the use of these models continues to expand, understanding these aspects is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and achieving long-term personalization. This study investigates the recommendations provided by ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 by assessing ChatGPT's capabilities in terms of diversity, novelty, and popularity bias. We evaluate these models on three distinct datasets and assess their performance in Top-N recommendation and cold-start scenarios. The findings reveal that ChatGPT-4 matches or surpasses traditional recommenders, demonstrating the ability to balance novelty and diversity in recommendations. Furthermore, in the cold-start scenario, ChatGPT models exhibit superior performance in both accuracy and novelty, suggesting they can be particularly beneficial for new users. This research highlights the strengths and limitations of ChatGPT's recommendations, offering new perspectives on the capacity of these models to provide recommendations beyond accuracy-focused metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mem-Rec: Memory Efficient Recommendation System using Alternative Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07205v3)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based recommendation systems (e.g., DLRMs) are widely used AI models to provide high-quality personalized recommendations. Training data used for modern recommendation systems commonly includes categorical features taking on tens-of-millions of possible distinct values. These categorical tokens are typically assigned learned vector representations, that are stored in large embedding tables, on the order of 100s of GB. Storing and accessing these tables represent a substantial burden in commercial deployments. Our work proposes MEM-REC, a novel alternative representation approach for embedding tables. MEM-REC leverages bloom filters and hashing methods to encode categorical features using two cache-friendly embedding tables. The first table (token embedding) contains raw embeddings (i.e. learned vector representation), and the second table (weight embedding), which is much smaller, contains weights to scale these raw embeddings to provide better discriminative capability to each data point. We provide a detailed architecture, design and analysis of MEM-REC addressing trade-offs in accuracy and computation requirements, in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques. We show that MEM-REC can not only maintain the recommendation quality and significantly reduce the memory footprint for commercial scale recommendation models but can also improve the embedding latency. In particular, based on our results, MEM-REC compresses the MLPerf CriteoTB benchmark DLRM model size by 2900x and performs up to 3.4x faster embeddings while achieving the same AUC as that of the full uncompressed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[MergeRec: Model Merging for Data-Isolated Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01753v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern recommender systems trained on domain-specific data often struggle to generalize across multiple domains. Cross-domain sequential recommendation has emerged as a promising research direction to address this challenge; however, existing approaches face fundamental limitations, such as reliance on overlapping users or items across domains, or unrealistic assumptions that ignore privacy constraints. In this work, we propose a new framework, MergeRec, based on model merging under a new and realistic problem setting termed data-isolated cross-domain sequential recommendation, where raw user interaction data cannot be shared across domains. MergeRec consists of three key components: (1) merging initialization, (2) pseudo-user data construction, and (3) collaborative merging optimization. First, we initialize a merged model using training-free merging techniques. Next, we construct pseudo-user data by treating each item as a virtual sequence in each domain, enabling the synthesis of meaningful training samples without relying on real user interactions. Finally, we optimize domain-specific merging weights through a joint objective that combines a recommendation loss, which encourages the merged model to identify relevant items, and a distillation loss, which transfers collaborative filtering signals from the fine-tuned source models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MergeRec not only preserves the strengths of the original models but also significantly enhances generalizability to unseen domains. Compared to conventional model merging methods, MergeRec consistently achieves superior performance, with average improvements of up to 17.21% in Recall@10, highlighting the potential of model merging as a scalable and effective approach for building universal recommender systems.

Generative recommendation (GR) models can improve quality by consuming long user-behavior sequences, but in production their online sequence length is tightly capped by the ranking-stage P99 budget. We observe that the majority of GR tokens encode user behaviors that are independent of the item candidates, suggesting an opportunity to pre-infer a user-behavior prefix once and reuse it during ranking rather than recomputing it on the critical path. Realizing this idea at industrial scale is non-trivial: the prefix cache must survive across multiple pipeline stages before the final ranking instance is determined, the user population implies cache footprints far beyond a single device, and indiscriminate pre-inference would overload shared resources under high QPS. We present RelayGR, a production system that enables in-HBM relay-race inference for GR. RelayGR selectively pre-infers long-term user prefixes, keeps their KV caches resident in HBM over the request lifecycle, and ensures the subsequent ranking can consume them without remote fetches. RelayGR combines three techniques: 1) a sequence-aware trigger that admits only at-risk requests under a bounded cache footprint and pre-inference load, 2) an affinity-aware router that co-locates cache production and consumption by routing both the auxiliary pre-infer signal and the ranking request to the same instance, and 3) a memory-aware expander that uses server-local DRAM to capture short-term cross-request reuse while avoiding redundant reloads. We implement RelayGR on Huawei Ascend NPUs and evaluate it with real queries. Under a fixed P99 SLO, RelayGR supports up to 1.5$\times$ longer sequences and improves SLO-compliant throughput by up to 3.6$\times$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Resilient Elections with Adversarial GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01653v1)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the face of adverse motives, it is indispensable to achieve a consensus. Elections have been the canonical way by which modern democracy has operated since the 17th century. Nowadays, they regulate markets, provide an engine for modern recommender systems or peer-to-peer networks, and remain the main approach to represent democracy. However, a desirable universal voting rule that satisfies all hypothetical scenarios is still a challenging topic, and the design of these systems is at the forefront of mechanism design research. Automated mechanism design is a promising approach, and recent works have demonstrated that set-invariant architectures are uniquely suited to modelling electoral systems. However, various concerns prevent the direct application to real-world settings, such as robustness to strategic voting. In this paper, we generalise the expressive capability of learned voting rules, and combine improvements in neural network architecture with adversarial training to improve the resilience of voting rules while maximizing social welfare. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our method resolves critical limitations of prior work regarding learning voting rules by representing elections using bipartite graphs, and learning such voting rules using graph neural networks. We believe this opens new frontiers for applying machine learning to real-world elections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Diffusion-based Augmentation for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01448v1)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems often rely on implicit feedback, where only positive user-item interactions can be observed. Negative sampling is therefore crucial to provide proper negative training signals. However, existing methods tend to mislabel potentially positive but unobserved items as negatives and lack precise control over negative sample selection. We aim to address these by generating controllable negative samples, rather than sampling from the existing item pool. In this context, we propose Adaptive Diffusion-based Augmentation for Recommendation (ADAR), a novel and model-agnostic module that leverages diffusion to synthesize informative negatives. Inspired by the progressive corruption process in diffusion, ADAR simulates a continuous transition from positive to negative, allowing for fine-grained control over sample hardness. To mine suitable negative samples, we theoretically identify the transition point at which a positive sample turns negative and derive a score-aware function to adaptively determine the optimal sampling timestep. By identifying this transition point, ADAR generates challenging negative samples that effectively refine the model's decision boundary. Experiments confirm that ADAR is broadly compatible and boosts the performance of existing recommendation models substantially, including collaborative filtering and sequential recommendation, without architectural modifications.</p></details> |  |

It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, encompassing implicit feedback such as clicked items and explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed by novel privacy attacks. However, no study has been conducted on this important issue. We design several membership inference attacks (MIAs) aimed to revealing whether system prompts include victims' historical interactions. The attacks are \emph{Similarity, Memorization, Inquiry, and Poisoning attacks}, each utilizing unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on five of the latest open-source LLMs and three well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat to LLM RecSys is realistic: inquiry and poisoning attacks show significantly high attack advantages. We also discussed possible methods to mitigate such MIA threats. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts, the position of the victim in the shots, the number of poisoning items in the prompt,etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is paper is under review WWW 2026</p></details> |
| **[Compositions of Variant Experts for Integrating Short-Term and Long-Term Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23170v2)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the online digital realm, recommendation systems are ubiquitous and play a crucial role in enhancing user experience. These systems leverage user preferences to provide personalized recommendations, thereby helping users navigate through the paradox of choice. This work focuses on personalized sequential recommendation, where the system considers not only a user's immediate, evolving session context, but also their cumulative historical behavior to provide highly relevant and timely recommendations. Through an empirical study conducted on diverse real-world datasets, we have observed and quantified the existence and impact of both short-term (immediate and transient) and long-term (enduring and stable) preferences on users' historical interactions. Building on these insights, we propose a framework that combines short- and long-term preferences to enhance recommendation performance, namely Compositions of Variant Experts (CoVE). This novel framework dynamically integrates short- and long-term preferences through the use of different specialized recommendation models (i.e., experts). Extensive experiments showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methods and ablation studies further investigate the impact of variant expert types.</p></details> |  |

Despite this progress, efficiently promoting dataset sharing and utilization for scientific research remains challenging. Scientific datasets contain intricate domain-specific knowledge and contexts, rendering traditional collaborative filtering-based recommenders inadequate. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to build conversational agents capable of deep semantic understanding and personalized recommendations. In response, we present ScienceDB AI, a novel LLM-driven agentic recommender system developed on Science Data Bank (ScienceDB), one of the largest global scientific data-sharing platforms. ScienceDB AI leverages natural language conversations and deep reasoning to accurately recommend datasets aligned with researchers' scientific intents and evolving requirements. The system introduces several innovations: a Scientific Intention Perceptor to extract structured experimental elements from complicated queries, a Structured Memory Compressor to manage multi-turn dialogues effectively, and a Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Trustworthy RAG) framework. The Trustworthy RAG employs a two-stage retrieval mechanism and provides citable dataset references via Citable Scientific Task Record (CSTR) identifiers, enhancing recommendation trustworthiness and reproducibility. Through extensive offline and online experiments using over 10 million real-world datasets, ScienceDB AI has demonstrated significant effectiveness. To our knowledge, ScienceDB AI is the first LLM-driven conversational recommender tailored explicitly for large-scale scientific dataset sharing services. The platform is publicly accessible at: https://ai.scidb.cn/en.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Socially-Aware Recommender Systems Mitigate Opinion Clusterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02412v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems shape online interactions by matching users with creators content to maximize engagement. Creators, in turn, adapt their content to align with users preferences and enhance their popularity. At the same time, users preferences evolve under the influence of both suggested content from the recommender system and content shared within their social circles. This feedback loop generates a complex interplay between users, creators, and recommender algorithms, which is the key cause of filter bubbles and opinion polarization. We develop a social network-aware recommender system that explicitly accounts for this user-creators feedback interaction and strategically exploits the topology of the user's own social network to promote diversification. Our approach highlights how accounting for and exploiting user's social network in the recommender system design is crucial to mediate filter bubble effects while balancing content diversity with personalization. Provably, opinion clusterization is positively correlated with the influence of recommended content on user opinions. Ultimately, the proposed approach shows the power of socially-aware recommender systems in combating opinion polarization and clusterization phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[AlignUSER: Human-Aligned LLM Agents via World Models for Recommender System Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00930v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating recommender systems remains challenging due to the gap between offline metrics and real user behavior, as well as the scarcity of interaction data. Recent work explores large language model (LLM) agents as synthetic users, yet they typically rely on few-shot prompting, which yields a shallow understanding of the environment and limits their ability to faithfully reproduce user actions. We introduce AlignUSER, a framework that learns world-model-driven agents from human interactions. Given rollout sequences of actions and states, we formalize world modeling as a next state prediction task that helps the agent internalize the environment. To align actions with human personas, we generate counterfactual trajectories around demonstrations and prompt the LLM to compare its decisions with human choices, identify suboptimal actions, and extract lessons. The learned policy is then used to drive agent interactions with the recommender system. We evaluate AlignUSER across multiple datasets and demonstrate closer alignment with genuine humans than prior work, both at the micro and macro levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[OxygenREC: An Instruction-Following Generative Framework for E-commerce Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22386v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommendation systems suffer from inconsistency in multi-stage optimization objectives. Generative Recommendation (GR) mitigates them through an end-to-end framework; however, existing methods still rely on matching mechanisms based on inductive patterns. Although responsive, they lack the ability to uncover complex user intents that require deductive reasoning based on world knowledge. Meanwhile, LLMs show strong deep reasoning capabilities, but their latency and computational costs remain challenging for industrial applications. More critically, there are performance bottlenecks in multi-scenario scalability: as shown in Figure 1, existing solutions require independent training and deployment for each scenario, leading to low resource utilization and high maintenance costs-a challenge unaddressed in GR literature. To address these, we present OxygenREC, an industrial recommendation system that leverages Fast-Slow Thinking to deliver deep reasoning with strict latency and multi-scenario requirements of real-world environments. First, we adopt a Fast-Slow Thinking architecture. Slow thinking uses a near-line LLM pipeline to synthesize Contextual Reasoning Instructions, while fast thinking employs a high-efficiency encoder-decoder backbone for real-time generation. Second, to ensure reasoning instructions effectively enhance recommendation generation, we introduce a semantic alignment mechanism with Instruction-Guided Retrieval (IGR) to filter intent-relevant historical behaviors and use a Query-to-Item (Q2I) loss for instruction-item consistency. Finally, to resolve multi-scenario scalability, we transform scenario information into controllable instructions, using unified reward mapping and Soft Adaptive Group Clip Policy Optimization (SA-GCPO) to align policies with diverse business objectives, realizing a train-once-deploy-everywhere paradigm.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |
| **[OpenOneRec Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24762v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the OneRec series has successfully unified the fragmented recommendation pipeline into an end-to-end generative framework, a significant gap remains between recommendation systems and general intelligence. Constrained by isolated data, they operate as domain specialists-proficient in pattern matching but lacking world knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and instruction following. This limitation is further compounded by the lack of a holistic benchmark to evaluate such integrated capabilities. To address this, our contributions are: 1) RecIF Bench & Open Data: We propose RecIF-Bench, a holistic benchmark covering 8 diverse tasks that thoroughly evaluate capabilities from fundamental prediction to complex reasoning. Concurrently, we release a massive training dataset comprising 96 million interactions from 160,000 users to facilitate reproducible research. 2) Framework & Scaling: To ensure full reproducibility, we open-source our comprehensive training pipeline, encompassing data processing, co-pretraining, and post-training. Leveraging this framework, we demonstrate that recommendation capabilities can scale predictably while mitigating catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge. 3) OneRec-Foundation: We release OneRec Foundation (1.7B and 8B), a family of models establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across all tasks in RecIF-Bench. Furthermore, when transferred to the Amazon benchmark, our models surpass the strongest baselines with an average 26.8% improvement in Recall@10 across 10 diverse datasets (Figure 1). This work marks a step towards building truly intelligent recommender systems. Nonetheless, realizing this vision presents significant technical and theoretical challenges, highlighting the need for broader research engagement in this promising direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reveal Hidden Pitfalls and Navigate Next Generation of Vector Similarity Search from Task-Centric Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12980v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector Similarity Search (VSS) in high-dimensional spaces is rapidly emerging as core functionality in next-generation database systems for numerous data-intensive services -- from embedding lookups in large language models (LLMs), to semantic information retrieval and recommendation engines. Current benchmarks, however, evaluate VSS primarily on the recall-latency trade-off against a ground truth defined solely by distance metrics, neglecting how retrieval quality ultimately impacts downstream tasks. This disconnect can mislead both academic research and industrial practice. We present Iceberg, a holistic benchmark suite for end-to-end evaluation of VSS methods in realistic application contexts. From a task-centric view, Iceberg uncovers the Information Loss Funnel, which identifies three principal sources of end-to-end performance degradation: (1) Embedding Loss during feature extraction; (2) Metric Misuse, where distances poorly reflect task relevance; (3) Data Distribution Sensitivity, highlighting index robustness across skews and modalities. For a more comprehensive assessment, Iceberg spans eight diverse datasets across key domains such as image classification, face recognition, text retrieval, and recommendation systems. Each dataset, ranging from 1M to 100M vectors, includes rich, task-specific labels and evaluation metrics, enabling assessment of retrieval algorithms within the full application pipeline rather than in isolation. Iceberg benchmarks 13 state-of-the-art VSS methods and re-ranks them based on application-level metrics, revealing substantial deviations from traditional rankings derived purely from recall-latency evaluations. Building on these insights, we define a set of task-centric meta-features and derive an interpretable decision tree to guide practitioners in selecting and tuning VSS methods for their specific workloads.</p></details> | SIGMOD2026 |
| **[Effects of Algorithmic Visibility on Conspiracy Communities: Reddit after Epstein's 'Suicide'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24351v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines how algorithmic visibility shapes a large conspiracy community on Reddit after Jeffrey Epstein's death. We ask whether homepage exposure changes who join r/conspiracy, how long they stay, and how they adapt linguistically, compared with users who arrive through organic discovery. Using a computational framework that combines toxicity scores, survival analysis, and lexical and semantic measures, the study shows that homepage visibility acts as a selection mechanism rather than a simple amplifier. Users who discover the community organically integrate more quickly into its linguistic and thematic norms and show more stable engagement over time. By contrast, users who arrive through visibility on the homepage remain semantically distant from core discourse and participate more briefly. Overall, algorithmic visibility reshapes audience size, community composition, and linguistic cohesion: newcomers who do not join organically have different incentives, integrate weakly, and leave quickly, which limits organic growth. In this high-risk setting, the observed behavioral and linguistic trajectories over five months do not match standard narratives in which incidental exposure to conspiracy content produces durable radicalization. These findings can inform the design of web platforms and recommendation systems that seek to curb harmful conspiracy exposure while supporting more responsible, transparent, and socially beneficial uses of algorithmic recommendations.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically simplify multi-stage computation resource allocation, neglecting inter-stage dependencies, thus limiting global optimality. In this paper, we propose MaRCA, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for end-to-end computation resource allocation in large-scale recommender systems. MaRCA models the stages of a recommender system as cooperative agents, using Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) to optimize revenue under computation resource constraints. We introduce an AutoBucket TestBench for accurate computation cost estimation, and a Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Revenue-Cost Balancer to proactively forecast traffic loads and adjust the revenue-cost trade-off accordingly. Since its end-to-end deployment in the advertising pipeline of a leading global e-commerce platform in November 2024, MaRCA has consistently handled hundreds of billions of ad requests per day and has delivered a 16.67% revenue uplift using existing computation resources.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[CogRec: A Cognitive Recommender Agent Fusing Large Language Models and Soar for Explainable Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24113v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable capacity in understanding user preferences for recommendation systems. However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent "Black-Box" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution. This solution is subsequently transformed into a new symbolic production rule via Soar's chunking mechanism, thereby enabling robust online learning. This learning paradigm allows the agent to continuously evolve its knowledge base and furnish highly interpretable rationales for its recommendations. Extensive evaluations conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that CogRec demonstrates significant advantages in recommendation accuracy, explainability, and its efficacy in addressing the long-tail problem.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[ITDR: An Instruction Tuning Dataset for Enhancing Large Language Models in Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05667v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in natural language processing tasks. However, in the field of recommender systems, due to the inherent structural discrepancy between user behavior data and natural language, LLMs struggle to effectively model the associations between user preferences and items. Although prompt-based methods can generate recommendation results, their inadequate understanding of recommendation tasks leads to constrained performance. To address this gap, we construct a comprehensive instruction tuning dataset, ITDR, which encompasses seven subtasks across two root tasks: user-item interaction and user-item understanding. The dataset integrates data from 13 public recommendation datasets and is built using manually crafted standardized templates, comprising approximately 200,000 instances. Experimental results demonstrate that ITDR significantly enhances the performance of mainstream open-source LLMs such as GLM-4, Qwen2.5, Qwen2.5-Instruct and LLaMA-3.2 on recommendation tasks. Furthermore, we analyze the correlations between tasks and explore the impact of task descriptions and data scale on instruction tuning effectiveness. Finally, we perform comparative experiments against closed-source LLMs with massive parameters. Our tuning dataset ITDR, the fine-tuned large recommendation models, all LoRA modules, and the complete experimental results are available at https://github.com/hellolzk/ITDR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do LLMs Understand Collaborative Signals? Diagnosis and Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20730v3)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative information from user-item interactions is a fundamental source of signal in successful recommender systems. Recently, researchers have attempted to incorporate this knowledge into large language model-based recommender approaches (LLMRec) to enhance their performance. However, there has been little fundamental analysis of whether LLMs can effectively reason over collaborative information. In this paper, we analyze the ability of LLMs to reason about collaborative information in recommendation tasks, comparing their performance to traditional matrix factorization (MF) models. We propose a simple and effective method to improve LLMs' reasoning capabilities using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over the user-item interaction matrix with four different prompting strategies. Our results show that the LLM outperforms the MF model whenever we provide relevant information in a clear and easy-to-follow format, and prompt the LLM to reason based on it. We observe that with this strategy, in almost all cases, the more information we provide, the better the LLM performs.</p></details> |  |

| **[ReaSeq: Unleashing World Knowledge via Reasoning for Sequential Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21257v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial recommender systems face two fundamental limitations under the log-driven paradigm: (1) knowledge poverty in ID-based item representations that causes brittle interest modeling under data sparsity, and (2) systemic blindness to beyond-log user interests that constrains model performance within platform boundaries. These limitations stem from an over-reliance on shallow interaction statistics and close-looped feedback while neglecting the rich world knowledge about product semantics and cross-domain behavioral patterns that Large Language Models have learned from vast corpora. To address these challenges, we introduce ReaSeq, a reasoning-enhanced framework that leverages world knowledge in Large Language Models to address both limitations through explicit and implicit reasoning. Specifically, ReaSeq employs explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning via multi-agent collaboration to distill structured product knowledge into semantically enriched item representations, and latent reasoning via Diffusion Large Language Models to infer plausible beyond-log behaviors. Deployed on Taobao's ranking system serving hundreds of millions of users, ReaSeq achieves substantial gains: >6.0% in IPV and CTR, >2.9% in Orders, and >2.5% in GMV, validating the effectiveness of world-knowledge-enhanced reasoning over purely log-driven approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[AKG kernel Agent: A Multi-Agent Framework for Cross-Platform Kernel Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23424v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern AI models demand high-performance computation kernels. The growing complexity of LLMs, multimodal architectures, and recommendation systems, combined with techniques like sparsity and quantization, creates significant computational challenges. Moreover, frequent hardware updates and diverse chip architectures further complicate this landscape, requiring tailored kernel implementations for each platform. However, manual optimization cannot keep pace with these demands, creating a critical bottleneck in AI system development. Recent advances in LLM code generation capabilities have opened new possibilities for automating kernel development. In this work, we propose AKG kernel agent (AI-driven Kernel Generator), a multi-agent system that automates kernel generation, migration, and performance tuning. AKG kernel agent is designed to support multiple domain-specific languages (DSLs), including Triton, TileLang, CPP, and CUDA-C, enabling it to target different hardware backends while maintaining correctness and portability. The system's modular design allows rapid integration of new DSLs and hardware targets. When evaluated on KernelBench using Triton DSL across GPU and NPU backends, AKG kernel agent achieves an average speedup of 1.46$\times$ over PyTorch Eager baselines implementations, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating kernel development for modern AI workloads.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Embedding Based Ad Retrieval with GPU-Powered Feature Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22460v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large-scale advertising recommendation systems, retrieval serves as a critical component, aiming to efficiently select a subset of candidate ads relevant to user behaviors from a massive ad inventory for subsequent ranking and recommendation. The Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) methods modeled by the dual-tower network are widely used in the industry to maintain both retrieval efficiency and accuracy. However, the dual-tower model has significant limitations: the embeddings of users and ads interact only at the final inner product computation, resulting in insufficient feature interaction capabilities. Although DNN-based models with both user and ad as input features, allowing for early-stage interaction between these features, are introduced in the ranking stage to mitigate this issue, they are computationally infeasible for the retrieval stage. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an efficient GPU-based feature interaction for the dual-tower network to significantly improve retrieval accuracy while substantially reducing computational costs. Specifically, we introduce a novel compressed inverted list designed for GPU acceleration, enabling efficient feature interaction computation at scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework in the industry to successfully implement Wide and Deep in a retrieval system. We apply this model to the real-world business scenarios in Tencent Advertising, and experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in offline evaluation and has been successfully deployed to Tencent's advertising recommendation system, delivering significant online performance gains. This improvement not only validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, but also provides new practical guidance for optimizing large-scale ad retrieval systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

However, their integration lacks systematic empirical evaluation: practitioners typically deploy LVLMs as fixed black-box feature extractors without systematically comparing alternative representation strategies. To address this gap, we present the first systematic empirical study along two key design dimensions: (i) integration strategies with ID embeddings, specifically replacement versus fusion, and (ii) feature extraction paradigms, comparing LVLM-generated captions with intermediate decoder hidden states. Extensive experiments on representative LVLMs reveal three key principles: (1) intermediate hidden states consistently outperform caption-based representations, as natural-language summarization inevitably discards fine-grained visual semantics crucial for recommendation; (2) ID embeddings capture irreplaceable collaborative signals, rendering fusion strictly superior to replacement; and (3) the effectiveness of intermediate decoder features varies significantly across layers. Guided by these insights, we propose the Dual Feature Fusion (DFF) Framework, a lightweight and plug-and-play approach that adaptively fuses multi-layer representations from frozen LVLMs with item ID embeddings. DFF achieves state-of-the-art performance on two real-world micro-video recommendation benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines and providing a principled approach to integrating off-the-shelf large vision-language models into micro-video recommender systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Reproducible and Fair Evaluation of Partition-aware Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17015v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity-based collaborative filtering (CF) models have long demonstrated strong offline performance and conceptual simplicity. However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic cost of maintaining dense item-item similarity matrices. Partitioning-based paradigms have recently emerged as an effective strategy for balancing effectiveness and efficiency, enabling models to learn local similarities within coherent subgraphs while maintaining a limited global context. In this work, we focus on the Fine-tuning Partition-aware Similarity Refinement (FPSR) framework, a prominent representative of this family, as well as its extension, FPSR+. Reproducible evaluation of partition-aware collaborative filtering remains challenging, as prior FPSR/FPSR+ reports often rely on splits of unclear provenance and omit some similarity-based baselines, thereby complicating fair comparison. We present a transparent, fully reproducible benchmark of FPSR and FPSR+. Based on our results, the family of FPSR models does not consistently perform at the highest level. Overall, it remains competitive, validates its design choices, and shows significant advantages in long-tail scenarios. This highlights the accuracy-coverage trade-offs resulting from partitioning, global components, and hub design. Our investigation clarifies when partition-aware similarity modeling is most beneficial and offers actionable guidance for scalable recommender system design under reproducible protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECIR 2026 reproducibility track</p></details> |

Research to enhance I2I performance focuses on two directions: 1) model-centric approaches, which adopt deeper architectures but risk increased computational costs and deployment complexity, and 2) data-centric methods, which refine training data without altering models, offering cost-effectiveness but struggling with data sparsity and noise. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-I2I, a data-centric framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate data quality issues. LLM-I2I includes (1) an LLM-based generator that synthesizes user-item interactions for long-tail items, alleviating data sparsity, and (2) an LLM-based discriminator that filters noisy interactions from real and synthetic data. The refined data is then fused to train I2I models. Evaluated on industry (AEDS) and academic (ARD) datasets, LLM-I2I consistently improves recommendation accuracy, particularly for long-tail items. Deployed on a large-scale cross-border e-commerce platform, it boosts recall number (RN) by 6.02% and gross merchandise value (GMV) by 1.22% over existing I2I models.

| **[Agentic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (Agentic XAI) Approach To Explore Better Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21066v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMSRARec: Summarization and Retrieval Augumented Sequential Recommendation Based on Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20916v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in recommendation systems. However, the effective application of MLLMs to multimodal sequential recommendation remains unexplored: A) Existing methods primarily leverage the multimodal semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained MLLMs to generate item embeddings or semantic IDs, thereby enhancing traditional recommendation models. These approaches generate item representations that exhibit limited interpretability, and pose challenges when transferring to language model-based recommendation systems. B) Other approaches convert user behavior sequence into image-text pairs and perform recommendation through multiple MLLM inference, incurring prohibitive computational and time costs. C) Current MLLM-based recommendation systems generally neglect the integration of collaborative signals. To address these limitations while balancing recommendation performance, interpretability, and computational cost, this paper proposes MultiModal Summarization-and-Retrieval-Augmented Sequential Recommendation. Specifically, we first employ MLLM to summarize items into concise keywords and fine-tune the model using rewards that incorporate summary length, information loss, and reconstruction difficulty, thereby enabling adaptive adjustment of the summarization policy. Inspired by retrieval-augmented generation, we then transform collaborative signals into corresponding keywords and integrate them as supplementary context. Finally, we apply supervised fine-tuning with multi-task learning to align the MLLM with the multimodal sequential recommendation. Extensive evaluations on common recommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MMSRARec, showcasing its capability to efficiently and interpretably understand user behavior histories and item information for accurate recommendations.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Accurate and Diverse Recommendations via Propensity-Weighted Linear Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20896v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world recommender systems, user-item interactions are Missing Not At Random (MNAR), as interactions with popular items are more frequently observed than those with less popular ones. Missing observations shift recommendations toward frequently interacted items, which reduces the diversity of the recommendation list. To alleviate this problem, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) is widely used and commonly models propensities based on a power-law function of item interaction frequency. However, we found that such power-law-based correction overly penalizes popular items and harms their recommendation performance. We address this issue by redefining the propensity score to allow broader item recommendation without excessively penalizing popular items. The proposed score is formulated by applying a sigmoid function to the logarithm of the item observation frequency, maintaining the simplicity of power-law scoring while allowing for more flexible adjustment. Furthermore, we incorporate the redefined propensity score into a linear autoencoder model, which tends to favor popular items, and evaluate its effectiveness. Experimental results revealed that our method substantially improves the diversity of items in the recommendation list without sacrificing recommendation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the proceedings of SIGIR-AP'25</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Frequent Checkpointing via Low-Cost Differential for Distributed Training Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04084v3)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed training of large deep-learning models often leads to failures, so checkpointing is commonly employed for recovery. State-of-the-art studies focus on frequent checkpointing for fast recovery from failures. However, it generates numerous checkpoints, incurring substantial costs and thus degrading training performance. Recently, differential checkpointing has been proposed to reduce costs, but it is limited to recommendation systems, so its application to general distributed training systems remains unexplored. We propose \sysname, an efficient frequent checkpointing framework that \textit{reuses} compressed gradients, serving as differential checkpoints to reduce cost. Furthermore, \sysname incorporates a batched gradient write optimization to persist these differentials to storage efficiently. It also dynamically tunes both the checkpoint frequency and the batching size to maximize performance. To enhance \sysname under non-compression scenarios, we further propose \sysnameplus, which incorporates a layer-wise-reuse snapshotting strategy, along with an incremental-merging persistence strategy. Experiments on various workloads show that \sysname and \sysnameplus can reduce the training time by up to 89.2\% and 81.2\% with checkpointing frequency up to per iteration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Group-Aware Hashing for Fast Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20172v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fast online recommendation is critical for applications with large-scale databases; meanwhile, it is challenging to provide accurate recommendations in sparse scenarios. Hash technique has shown its superiority for speeding up the online recommendation by bit operations on Hamming distance computations. However, existing hashing-based recommendations suffer from low accuracy, especially with sparse settings, due to the limited representation capability of each bit and neglected inherent relations among users and items. To this end, this paper lodges a Collaborative Group-Aware Hashing (CGAH) method for both collaborative filtering (namely CGAH-CF) and content-aware recommendations (namely CGAH) by integrating the inherent group information to alleviate the sparse issue. Firstly, we extract inherent group affinities of users and items by classifying their latent vectors into different groups. Then, the preference is formulated as the inner product of the group affinity and the similarity of hash codes. By learning hash codes with the inherent group information, CGAH obtains more effective hash codes than other discrete methods with sparse interactive data. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show the superior performance of our proposed CGAH and CGAH-CF over the state-of-the-art discrete collaborative filtering methods and discrete content-aware recommendations under different sparse settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Scale-invariant Metric Learning for Efficient Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09898v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metric learning has attracted extensive interest for its ability to provide personalized recommendations based on the importance of observed user-item interactions. Current metric learning methods aim to push negative items away from the corresponding users and positive items by an absolute geometrical distance margin. However, items may come from imbalanced categories with different intra-class variations. Thus, the absolute distance margin may not be ideal for estimating the difference between user preferences over imbalanced items. To this end, we propose a new method, named discrete scale-invariant metric learning (DSIML), by adding binary constraints to users and items, which maps users and items into binary codes of a shared Hamming subspace to speed up the online recommendation. Specifically, we firstly propose a scale-invariant margin based on angles at the negative item points in the shared Hamming subspace. Then, we derive a scale-invariant triple hinge loss based on the margin. To capture more preference difference information, we integrate a pairwise ranking loss into the scale-invariant loss in the proposed model. Due to the difficulty of directly optimizing the mixed integer optimization problem formulated with \textit{log-sum-exp} functions, we seek to optimize its variational quadratic upper bound and learn hash codes with an alternating optimization strategy. Experiments on benchmark datasets clearly show that our proposed method is superior to competitive metric learning and hashing-based baselines for recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[IGDMRec: Behavior Conditioned Item Graph Diffusion for Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19983v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommender systems (MRSs) are critical for various online platforms, offering users more accurate personalized recommendations by incorporating multimodal information of items. Structure-based MRSs have achieved state-of-the-art performance by constructing semantic item graphs, which explicitly model relationships between items based on modality feature similarity. However, such semantic item graphs are often noisy due to 1) inherent noise in multimodal information and 2) misalignment between item semantics and user-item co-occurrence relationships, which introduces false links and leads to suboptimal recommendations. To address this challenge, we propose Item Graph Diffusion for Multimodal Recommendation (IGDMRec), a novel method that leverages a diffusion model with classifier-free guidance to denoise the semantic item graph by integrating user behavioral information. Specifically, IGDMRec introduces a Behavior-conditioned Graph Diffusion (BGD) module, incorporating interaction data as conditioning information to guide the denoising of the semantic item graph. Additionally, a Conditional Denoising Network (CD-Net) is designed to implement the denoising process with manageable complexity. Finally, we propose a contrastive representation augmentation scheme that leverages both the denoised item graph and the original item graph to enhance item representations. \LL{Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of IGDMRec over competitive baselines, with robustness analysis validating its denoising capability and ablation studies verifying the effectiveness of its key components.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures.

| **[A Computationally Efficient Framework for Overlapping Community Detection in Large Bipartite Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19426v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Community detection, which uncovers closely connected vertex groups in networks, is vital for applications in social networks, recommendation systems, and beyond. Real-world networks often have bipartite structures (vertices in two disjoint sets with inter-set connections), creating unique challenges on specialized community detection methods. Biclique percolation community (BCPC) is widely used to detect cohesive structures in bipartite graphs. A biclique is a complete bipartite subgraph, and a BCPC forms when maximal bicliques connect via adjacency (sharing an (alpha, beta)-biclique). Yet, existing methods for BCPC detection suffer from high time complexity due to the potentially massive maximal biclique adjacency graph (MBAG). To tackle this, we propose a novel partial-BCPC based solution, whose key idea is to use partial-BCPC to reduce the size of the MBAG. A partial-BCPC is a subset of BCPC. Maximal bicliques belonging to the same partial-BCPC must also belong to the same BCPC. Therefore, these maximal bicliques can be grouped as a single vertex in the MBAG, significantly reducing the size of the MBAG. Furthermore, we move beyond the limitations of MBAG and propose a novel BCPC detection approach based on (alpha, beta)-biclique enumeration. This approach detects BCPC by enumerating all (alpha, beta)-bicliques and connecting maximal bicliques sharing the same (alpha, beta)-biclique, which is the condition for maximal bicliques to be adjacent. It also leverages partial-BCPC to significantly prune the enumeration space of (alpha, beta)-biclique. Experiments show that our methods outperform existing methods by nearly three orders of magnitude.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Nonlinear Matrix Decompositions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17473v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving nonlinear matrix decompositions (NMD). Given an input matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and a factorization rank $r \ll \min(m, n)$, NMD seeks matrices $W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and $H \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$ such that $X \approx f(WH)$, where $f$ is an element-wise nonlinear function. We evaluate our method on several representative nonlinear models: the rectified linear unit activation $f(x) = \max(0, x)$, suitable for nonnegative sparse data approximation, the component-wise square $f(x) = x^2$, applicable to probabilistic circuit representation, and the MinMax transform $f(x) = \min(b, \max(a, x))$, relevant for recommender systems. The proposed framework flexibly supports diverse loss functions, including least squares, $\ell_1$ norm, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and can be readily extended to other nonlinearities and metrics. We illustrate the applicability, efficiency, and adaptability of the approach on real-world datasets, highlighting its potential for a broad range of applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures. v2: Added a forgotten acknowledgement.

| **[Faster Distributed Inference-Only Recommender Systems via Bounded Lag Synchronous Collectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19342v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are enablers of personalized content delivery, and therefore revenue, for many large companies. In the last decade, deep learning recommender models (DLRMs) are the de-facto standard in this field. The main bottleneck in DLRM inference is the lookup of sparse features across huge embedding tables, which are usually partitioned across the aggregate RAM of many nodes. In state-of-the-art recommender systems, the distributed lookup is implemented via irregular all-to-all (alltoallv) communication, and often presents the main bottleneck. Today, most related work sees this operation as a given; in addition, every collective is synchronous in nature. In this work, we propose a novel bounded lag synchronous (BLS) version of the alltoallv operation. The bound can be a parameter allowing slower processes to lag behind entire iterations before the fastest processes block. In special applications such as inference-only DLRM, the accuracy of the application is fully preserved. We implement BLS alltoallv in a new PyTorch Distributed backend and evaluate it with a BLS version of the reference DLRM code. We show that for well balanced, homogeneous-access DLRM runs our BLS technique does not offer notable advantages. But for unbalanced runs, e.g. runs with strongly irregular embedding table accesses or with delays across different processes, our BLS technique improves both the latency and throughput of inference-only DLRM. In the best-case scenario, the proposed reduced synchronisation can mask the delays across processes altogether.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPSR: Differentially Private Sparse Reconstruction via Multi-Stage Denoising for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18932v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential privacy (DP) has emerged as the gold standard for protecting user data in recommender systems, but existing privacy-preserving mechanisms face a fundamental challenge: the privacy-utility tradeoff inevitably degrades recommendation quality as privacy budgets tighten. We introduce DPSR (Differentially Private Sparse Reconstruction), a novel three-stage denoising framework that fundamentally addresses this limitation by exploiting the inherent structure of rating matrices -- sparsity, low-rank properties, and collaborative patterns. DPSR consists of three synergistic stages: (1) \textit{information-theoretic noise calibration} that adaptively reduces noise for high-information ratings, (2) \textit{collaborative filtering-based denoising} that leverages item-item similarities to remove privacy noise, and (3) \textit{low-rank matrix completion} that exploits latent structure for signal recovery. Critically, all denoising operations occur \textit{after} noise injection, preserving differential privacy through the post-processing immunity theorem while removing both privacy-induced and inherent data noise. Through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled ground truth, we demonstrate that DPSR achieves 5.57\% to 9.23\% RMSE improvement over state-of-the-art Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms across privacy budgets ranging from $\varepsilon=0.1$ to $\varepsilon=10.0$ (all improvements statistically significant with $p < 0.05$, most $p < 0.001$). Remarkably, at $\varepsilon=1.0$, DPSR achieves RMSE of 0.9823, \textit{outperforming even the non-private baseline} (1.0983), demonstrating that our denoising pipeline acts as an effective regularizer that removes data noise in addition to privacy noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[CIRR: Causal-Invariant Retrieval-Augmented Recommendation with Faithful Explanations under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18683v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promise in enhancing recommendation systems with external knowledge. However, existing RAG-based recommenders face two critical challenges: (1) vulnerability to distribution shifts across different environments (e.g., time periods, user segments), leading to performance degradation in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, and (2) lack of faithful explanations that can be verified against retrieved evidence. In this paper, we propose CIRR, a Causal-Invariant Retrieval-Augmented Recommendation framework that addresses both challenges simultaneously. CIRR learns environment-invariant user preference representations through causal inference, which guide a debiased retrieval process to select relevant evidence from multiple sources. Furthermore, we introduce consistency constraints that enforce faithfulness between retrieved evidence, generated explanations, and recommendation outputs. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that CIRR achieves robust performance under distribution shifts, reducing performance degradation from 15.4% (baseline) to only 5.6% in OOD scenarios, while providing more faithful and interpretable explanations (26% improvement in faithfulness score) compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mirroring Users: Towards Building Preference-aligned User Simulator with User Feedback in Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18142v2)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User simulation is increasingly vital to develop and evaluate recommender systems (RSs). While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues to simulate user behavior, they often struggle with the absence of specific task alignment required for RSs and the efficiency demands of large-scale simulation. A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is the extensive user feedback inherent in RSs, but leveraging it is challenging due to its ambiguity, noise and massive volume, which hinders efficient preference alignment. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in RSs with advanced LLM capabilities to generate high-quality simulation data. Our framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) using LLMs to generate decision-making processes as explanatory rationales on simulation samples, thereby reducing ambiguity; and (2) data distillation based on uncertainty estimation and behavior sampling to efficiently filter the most informative, denoised samples. Accordingly, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs, as user simulators, using such high-quality dataset with corresponding decision-making processes. Extensive experiments confirm that our framework significantly boosts the alignment with human preferences and the in-domain reasoning capabilities of the fine-tuned LLMs, providing more insightful and interpretable signals for RS interaction. We believe our work, together with publicly available developed framework, high-quality mixed-domain dataset, and fine-tuned LLM checkpoints, will advance the RS community and offer valuable insights for broader human-centric AI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github: https://github.com/UserMirrorer/UserMirrorer</p></details> |

Individual fairness has garnered traction in graph representation learning due to its practical importance in high-stakes Web areas such as user modeling, recommender systems, and search. However, existing methods assume the existence of predefined similarity information over all node pairs, an often unrealistic requirement that prevents their operationalization in practice. In this paper, we assume the similarity information is only available for a limited subset of node pairs and introduce FairExpand, a flexible framework that promotes individual fairness in this more realistic partial information scenario. FairExpand follows a two-step pipeline that alternates between refining node representations using a backbone model (e.g., a graph neural network) and gradually propagating similarity information, which allows fairness enforcement to effectively expand to the entire graph. Extensive experiments show that FairExpand consistently enhances individual fairness while preserving performance, making it a practical solution for enabling graph-based individual fairness in real-world applications with partial similarity information.</p></details> |  |

Yet, aligning LLMs to the recommendation task remains challenging: pretrained LLMs often generate out-of-catalog items, violate required output formats, and their ranking quality degrades sharply toward the end of the generated list. To this end, we propose ConvRec-R1, a two-stage framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based conversational recommender systems. In Stage 1, we construct a behavioral-cloning dataset with a Remap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline, which produces high-quality, catalog-grounded demonstrations from powerful blackbox LLMs to warm-start the RL training. In Stage 2, we propose Rank-GRPO, a principled extension of group relative policy optimization (GRPO) tailored to tasks with rank-style outputs. Rank-GRPO treats each rank in the recommendation list as the unit instead of token (too fine-grained) or sequence (too coarse), redefining rewards to remove non-causal credit assignment and introducing a rank-level importance ratio based on the geometric mean of rank-wise token probabilities to stabilize policy updates. Experiments on the public Reddit-v2 dataset show that ConvRec-R1 converges faster and achieves higher Recall and NDCG than GRPO-style baselines.

In particular, with the rise of these approaches, studies have shown that users exhibit different POI choices in their familiar and unfamiliar areas, highlighting the importance of incorporating user familiarity into predictive models. However, existing methods often fail to distinguish between the movements of users in familiar and unfamiliar regions. To address this, we propose MoE-TransMov, a Transformer-based model with a Transformer model with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to use one framework to capture distinct mobility patterns across different moving contexts without requiring separate training for certain data. Using user-check-in data, we classify movements into familiar and unfamiliar categories and develop a specialized expert network to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach integrates self-attention mechanisms and adaptive gating networks to dynamically select the most relevant expert models for different mobility contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets, including the widely used but small open-source Foursquare NYC dataset and the large-scale Kyoto dataset collected with LY Corporation (Yahoo Japan Corporation), show that MoE-TransMov outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with notable improvements in Top-1, Top-5, Top-10 accuracy, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Given the results, we find that by using this approach, we can efficiently improve mobility predictions under different moving contexts, thereby enhancing the personalization of recommendation systems and advancing various urban applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Generative recommendation (GR) integrates LLMs to enhance the understanding of long user-item sequences. Despite employing attention-based architectures, GR's workload differs markedly from that of LLM serving. GR typically processes long prompt while producing short, fixed-length outputs, yet the computational cost of each decode phase is especially high due to the large beam width. In addition, since the beam search involves a vast item space, the sorting overhead becomes particularly time-consuming. We propose xGR, a GR-oriented serving system that meets strict low-latency requirements under highconcurrency scenarios. First, xGR unifies the processing of prefill and decode phases through staged computation and separated KV cache. Second, xGR enables early sorting termination and mask-based item filtering with data structure reuse. Third, xGR reconstructs the overall pipeline to exploit multilevel overlap and multi-stream parallelism. Our experiments with real-world recommendation service datasets demonstrate that xGR achieves at least 3.49x throughput compared to the state-of-the-art baseline under strict latency constraints.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge lies in the large semantic gap between LLMs and RecSys where the former internalizes language world knowledge while the latter captures personalized world of behaviors. Unfortunately, the research community lacks a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the LLMs over their limitations and boundaries in RecSys so that we can draw a confident conclusion. To investigate this, we propose a benchmark named LRWorld containing over 38K high-quality samples and 23M tokens carefully compiled and generated from widely used public recommendation datasets. LRWorld categorizes the mental world of LLMs in RecSys as three main scales (association, personalization, and knowledgeability) spanned by ten factors with 31 measures (tasks). Based on LRWorld, comprehensive experiments on dozens of LLMs show that they are still not well capturing the deep neural personalized embeddings but can achieve good results on shallow memory-based item-item similarity. They are also good at perceiving item entity relations, entity hierarchical taxonomies, and item-item association rules when inferring user interests. Furthermore, LLMs show a promising ability in multimodal knowledge reasoning (movie poster and product image) and robustness to noisy profiles. None of them show consistently good performance over the ten factors. Model sizes, position bias, and more are ablated.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures, 27 tables, submission to KDD 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we study the problem of improving RecSys model predictions for cold-start (CS) items, which appear infrequently in the training data. Although this problem is well-studied in academia, few studies have addressed its root causes effectively at the scale of a platform like Pinterest. By investigating live traffic data, we identified several challenges of the CS problem and developed a corresponding solution for each: First, industrial-scale RecSys models must operate under tight computational constraints. Since CS items are a minority, any related improvements must be highly cost-efficient. To address this, our solutions were designed to be lightweight, collectively increasing the total parameters by only 5%. Second, CS items are represented only by non-historical (e.g., content or attribute) features, which models often treat as less important. To elevate their significance, we introduce a residual connection for the non-historical features. Third, CS items tend to receive lower prediction scores compared to non-CS items, reducing their likelihood of being surfaced. We mitigate this by incorporating a score regularization term into the model. Fourth, the labels associated with CS items are sparse, making it difficult for the model to learn from them. We apply the manifold mixup technique to address this data sparsity. Implemented together, our methods increased fresh content engagement at Pinterest by 10% without negatively impacting overall engagement and cost, and have been deployed to serve over 570 million users on Pinterest.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the WWW'26</p></details> |

It has several application domains in market analysis, customer recommendation, and recommendation systems. This study presents a comparative analysis of the widely used machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost, XGBoost, and an SVM variant (SVM_R) with neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy). The paper also explores the effect of text representations such as TF-IDF, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and RoBERTa. Additionally, various feature extraction techniques, including Chi-Square, Mutual Information, and Principal Component Analysis, are explored. Building on these, we introduce a comparative analysis of the machine learning and deep learning approaches in comparison to the NeSy. The experimental results show that the use of the NeSy approach matched strong MLP results despite a limited dataset. Future work on this research will expand the knowledge base, the scope of embedding types, and the hyperparameter configuration to further study the effectiveness of the NeSy approach.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Existing methods typically construct sparser views by randomly perturbing the original interaction graph, as they have no idea about the authentic user preferences. Owing to the sparse nature of recommendation data, this paradigm can only capture insufficient semantic information. To address the issue, we propose InfoDCL, a novel diffusion-based contrastive learning framework for recommendation. Rather than injecting randomly sampled Gaussian noise, we employ a single-step diffusion process that integrates noise with auxiliary semantic information to generate signals and feed them to the standard diffusion process to generate authentic user preferences as contrastive views. Besides, based on a comprehensive analysis of the mutual influence between generation and preference learning in InfoDCL, we build a collaborative training objective strategy to transform the interference between them into mutual collaboration. Additionally, we employ multiple GCN layers only during inference stage to incorporate higher-order co-occurrence information while maintaining training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that InfoDCL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our InfoDCL offers an effective solution for enhancing recommendation performance and suggests a novel paradigm for applying diffusion method in contrastive learning frameworks.</p></details> |  |

In 1978, Reid proposed the conjecture that for any set of nonnegative integers $D$, there exists a tournament $T$ with a degree set $D$. In 1989, Yao presented an arithmetical proof of the conjecture, but a general polynomial-time construction algorithm is not known. This paper proposes a necessary and sufficient condition and a separate necessary condition, based on the existing Landau's theorem for the problem of reconstructing score sequences from score sets of tournament graphs. The necessary condition introduces a structured set that enables the use of group-theoretic techniques, offering not only a framework for solving the reconstruction problem but also a new perspective for approaching similar problems. In particular, the same theoretical approach can be extended to reconstruct valid score sets given constraints on the frequency of distinct scores in tournaments. Based on these conditions, we have developed three algorithms that demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: a polynomial-time algorithm and a scalable algorithm for reconstructing score sequences, and a polynomial-time network-building method that finds all possible score sequences for a given score set. Moreover, the polynomial-time algorithm for reconstructing the score sequence of a tournament for a given score set can be used to verify Reid's conjecture. These algorithms have practical applications in sports analysis, ranking prediction, and machine learning tasks such as learning-to-rank models and data imputation, where the reconstruction of partial rankings or sequences is essential for recommendation systems and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint version of the paper, which is part of ongoing research.

This paper proposes WeMusic-Agent, a training framework for efficient LLM-based conversational music recommendation. By integrating the knowledge internalization and agentic boundary learning, the framework aims to teach the model to intelligently decide when to leverage internalized knowledge and when to call specialized tools (e.g., music retrieval APIs, music recommendation systems). Under this framework, we present WeMusic-Agent-M1, an agentic model that internalizes extensive musical knowledge via continued pretraining on 50B music-related corpus while acquiring the ability to invoke external tools when necessary. Additionally, considering the lack of open-source benchmarks for conversational music recommendation, we also construct a benchmark for personalized music recommendations derived from real-world data in WeChat Listen. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation across multiple dimensions, including relevance, personalization, and diversity of the recommendations. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that WeMusic-Agent achieves significant improvements over existing models.</p></details> |  |

The owners of a website generate profits from the user interaction with the contents or items of the website. A robust recommendation system can increase user interaction with a website by recommending items according to the user's unique preferences. BERT and CNN-integrated neural collaborative filtering (NCF) have been proposed for the recommendation system in this experiment. The proposed model takes inputs from the user and item profile and finds the user's interest. This model can handle numeric, categorical, and image data to extract the latent features from the inputs. The model is trained and validated on a small sample of the MovieLens dataset for 25 epochs. The same dataset has been used to train and validate a simple NCF and a BERT-based NCF model and compared with the proposed model. The proposed model outperformed those two baseline models. The obtained result for the proposed model is 0.72 recall and 0.486 Hit Ratio @ 10 for 799 users on the MovieLens dataset. This experiment concludes that considering both categorical and image data can improve the performance of a recommendation system.</p></details> |  |

Production DLRMs deploy decoupled training/inference clusters, where synchronizing petabyte-scale embedding tables (EMTs) causes multi-minute staleness, degrading recommendation quality and revenue. We observe that (1) inference nodes exhibit sustained CPU underutilization (peak <= 20%), and (2) EMT gradients possess intrinsic low-rank structure, enabling compact update representation. We present LiveUpdate, a system that eliminates inter-cluster synchronization by colocating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) trainers within inference nodes. LiveUpdate addresses two core challenges: (1) dynamic rank adaptation via singular value monitoring to constrain memory overhead (<2% of EMTs), and (2) NUMA-aware resource scheduling with hardware-enforced QoS to eliminate update inference contention (P99 latency impact <20ms). Evaluations show LiveUpdate reduces update costs by 2x versus delta-update baselines while achieving higher accuracy within 1-hour windows. By transforming idle inference resources into freshness engines, LiveUpdate delivers online model updates while outperforming state-of-the-art delta-update methods by 0.04% to 0.24% in accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by HPCA 2026</p></details> |
| **[RecGPT-V2 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14503v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in transforming recommender systems from implicit behavioral pattern matching to explicit intent reasoning. While RecGPT-V1 successfully pioneered this paradigm by integrating LLM-based reasoning into user interest mining and item tag prediction, it suffers from four fundamental limitations: (1) computational inefficiency and cognitive redundancy across multiple reasoning routes; (2) insufficient explanation diversity in fixed-template generation; (3) limited generalization under supervised learning paradigms; and (4) simplistic outcome-focused evaluation that fails to match human standards. To address these challenges, we present RecGPT-V2 with four key innovations. First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage. Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%. Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance. Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment. Online A/B tests on Taobao demonstrate significant improvements: +2.98% CTR, +3.71% IPV, +2.19% TV, and +11.46% NER. RecGPT-V2 establishes both the technical feasibility and commercial viability of deploying LLM-powered intent reasoning at scale, bridging the gap between cognitive exploration and industrial utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Offline Metrics Measure Explanation Goals? A Comparative Survey Analysis of Offline Explanation Metrics in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14379v5)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Recommender System (RS), explanations help users understand why items are recommended and can enhance a system's transparency, persuasiveness, engagement, and trust, which are known as explanation goals. However, evaluating the effectiveness of explanation algorithms offline remains challenging because explanation goals are inherently subjective. We initially conducted a rapid literature review, which revealed that algorithms are often assessed using anecdotal evidence (offering convincing examples) or using metrics that do not align with human perception. From these results, we investigated whether the selection of item attributes and interacted items affects explanation goals in explanations that generate a path connecting interacted and recommended items based on shared attributes (such as genres). We used metrics that measure the diversity and popularity of attributes and the recency of item interactions to evaluate explanations from three state-of-the-art agnostic algorithms across six recommendation systems. We then performed an online user study to compare user perceptions of explanation goals and offline metrics. Our findings indicate that engagement is sensitive to users' perceptions of diversity in explanations, whereas transparency, trust, and persuasiveness are influenced by perceptions of both popularity and diversity. However, offline metrics require refinement to more closely align with explanation goals and user understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[AsarRec: Adaptive Sequential Augmentation for Robust Self-supervised Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14047v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommender systems have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling users' dynamic preferences and capturing item transition patterns. However, real-world user behaviors are often noisy due to factors such as human errors, uncertainty, and behavioral ambiguity, which can lead to degraded recommendation performance. To address this issue, recent approaches widely adopt self-supervised learning (SSL), particularly contrastive learning, by generating perturbed views of user interaction sequences and maximizing their mutual information to improve model robustness. However, these methods heavily rely on their pre-defined static augmentation strategies~(where the augmentation type remains fixed once chosen) to construct augmented views, leading to two critical challenges: (1) the optimal augmentation type can vary significantly across different scenarios; (2) inappropriate augmentations may even degrade recommendation performance, limiting the effectiveness of SSL. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive augmentation framework. We first unify existing basic augmentation operations into a unified formulation via structured transformation matrices. Building on this, we introduce AsarRec (Adaptive Sequential Augmentation for Robust Sequential Recommendation), which learns to generate transformation matrices by encoding user sequences into probabilistic transition matrices and projecting them into hard semi-doubly stochastic matrices via a differentiable Semi-Sinkhorn algorithm. To ensure that the learned augmentations benefit downstream performance, we jointly optimize three objectives: diversity, semantic invariance, and informativeness. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets under varying noise levels validate the effectiveness of AsarRec, demonstrating its superior robustness and consistent improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Feature Interaction to Feature Generation: A Generative Paradigm of CTR Prediction Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14041v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a core task in recommendation systems, aims to estimate the probability of users clicking on items. Existing models predominantly follow a discriminative paradigm, which relies heavily on explicit interactions between raw ID embeddings. However, this paradigm inherently renders them susceptible to two critical issues: embedding dimensional collapse and information redundancy, stemming from the over-reliance on feature interactions \emph{over raw ID embeddings}. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \emph{Supervised Feature Generation (SFG)} framework, \emph{shifting the paradigm from discriminative ``feature interaction" to generative ``feature generation"}. Specifically, SFG comprises two key components: an \emph{Encoder} that constructs hidden embeddings for each feature, and a \emph{Decoder} tasked with regenerating the feature embeddings of all features from these hidden representations. Unlike existing generative approaches that adopt self-supervised losses, we introduce a supervised loss to utilize the supervised signal, \ie, click or not, in the CTR prediction task. This framework exhibits strong generalizability: it can be seamlessly integrated with most existing CTR models, reformulating them under the generative paradigm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFG consistently mitigates embedding collapse and reduces information redundancy, while yielding substantial performance gains across various datasets and base models. The code is available at https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/GE4Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intent-Guided Reasoning for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14034v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation systems aim to capture users' evolving preferences from their interaction histories. Recent reasoningenhanced methods have shown promise by introducing deliberate, chain-of-thought-like processes with intermediate reasoning steps. However, these methods rely solely on the next target item as supervision, leading to two critical issues: (1) reasoning instability--the process becomes overly sensitive to recent behaviors and spurious interactions like accidental clicks, and (2) surface-level reasoning--the model memorizes item-to-item transitions rather than understanding intrinsic behavior patterns. To address these challenges, we propose IGR-SR, an Intent-Guided Reasoning framework for Sequential Recommendation that anchors the reasoning process to explicitly extracted high-level intents. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a Latent Intent Distiller (LID) that efficiently extracts multi-faceted intents using a frozen encoder with learnable tokens, (2) an Intent-aware Deliberative Reasoner (IDR) that decouples reasoning into intent deliberation and decision-making via a dual-attention architecture, and (3) an Intent Consistency Regularization (ICR) that ensures robustness by enforcing consistent representations across different intent views. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that IGR-SR achieves an average 7.13% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Critically, under 20% behavioral noise, IGR-SR degrades only 10.4% compared to 16.2% and 18.6% for competing methods, validating the effectiveness and robustness of intent-guided reasoning.</p></details> | Under Review |

We propose SymCERE (Symmetric NCE), a contrastive learning framework bridging this gap via structural geometric alignment. First, we introduce a symmetric NCE loss that leverages full interaction history to exclude false negatives. Second, we integrate L2 normalization to structurally neutralize popularity bias. Experiments on 15 datasets (e-commerce, local reviews, travel) demonstrate that SymCERE outperforms strong baselines, improving NDCG@10 by up to 43.6%. Notably, we validate this on raw reviews, addressing significant noise. Analysis reveals "Semantic Anchoring," where the model aligns on objective vocabulary (e.g., "OEM," "gasket") rather than generic sentiment. This indicates effective alignment stems from extracting factual attributes, offering a path toward robust, interpretable systems.

One tactic that has risen to the level of the public consciousness is the concept of addictive design, evidenced by the fact that excessive social media use has become a salient problem, particularly in the mental and social development of adolescents and young adults. As tech companies have developed more and more sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) models to power their algorithmic recommender systems, they will become more successful at their goal of ensuring addiction to their platforms. This paper explores how online platforms intentionally cultivate addictive user behaviors and the broad societal implications, including on the health and well-being of children and adolescents. It presents the usage of addictive design - including the usage of dark patterns, persuasive design elements, and recommender algorithms - as a tool leveraged by technology corporations to maintain their dominance. Lastly, it describes the challenge of content moderation to address the problem and gives an overview of solutions at the policy level to counteract addictive design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Computational Approaches to Content Moderation and Platform Governance (COMPASS) at ICWSM'25</p></details> |
| **[BlossomRec: Block-level Fused Sparse Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13368v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer structures have been widely used in sequential recommender systems (SRS). However, as user interaction histories increase, computational time and memory requirements also grow. This is mainly caused by the standard attention mechanism. Although there exist many methods employing efficient attention and SSM-based models, these approaches struggle to effectively model long sequences and may exhibit unstable performance on short sequences. To address these challenges, we design a sparse attention mechanism, BlossomRec, which models both long-term and short-term user interests through attention computation to achieve stable performance across sequences of varying lengths. Specifically, we categorize user interests in recommendation systems into long-term and short-term interests, and compute them using two distinct sparse attention patterns, with the results combined through a learnable gated output. Theoretically, it significantly reduces the number of interactions participating in attention computation. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BlossomRec, when integrated with state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, achieves comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing memory usage, providing strong evidence of BlossomRec's efficiency and effectiveness.The code is available at https://github.com/ronineume/BlossomRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Know Your Users! Estimating User Domain Knowledge in Conversational Recommenders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13173v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ideal conversational recommender system (CRS) acts like a savvy salesperson, adapting its language and suggestions to each user's level of expertise. However, most current systems treat all users as experts, leading to frustrating and inefficient interactions when users are unfamiliar with a domain. Systems that can adapt their conversational strategies to a user's knowledge level stand to offer a much more natural and effective experience. To make a step toward such adaptive systems, we introduce a new task: estimating user domain knowledge from conversations, enabling a CRS to better understand user needs and personalize interactions. A key obstacle to developing such adaptive systems is the lack of suitable data; to our knowledge, no existing dataset captures the conversational behaviors of users with varying levels of domain knowledge. Furthermore, in most dialogue collection protocols, users are free to express their own preferences, which tends to concentrate on popular items and well-known features, offering little insight into how novices explore or learn about unfamiliar features. To address this, we design a game-based data collection protocol that elicits varied expressions of knowledge, release the resulting dataset, and provide an initial analysis to highlight its potential for future work on user-knowledge-aware CRS.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world applications often face situations where no training data is available, such as when launching new services or handling entirely new users. In such cases, conventional approaches cannot be applied. This study focuses on training-free recommendation, where no task-specific training is performed, and particularly on \textit{training-free cold-start recommendation} (TFCSR), the more challenging case where the target user has no interactions. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been explored as a promising solution, and numerous studies have been proposed. As the ability of text embedding models (TEMs) increases, they are increasingly recognized as applicable to training-free recommendation, but no prior work has directly compared LLMs and TEMs under identical conditions. We present the first controlled experiments that systematically evaluate these two approaches in the same setting. The results show that TEMs outperform LLM rerankers, and this trend holds not only in cold-start settings but also in warm-start settings with rich interactions. These findings indicate that direct LLM ranking is not the only viable option, contrary to the commonly shared belief, and TEM-based approaches provide a stronger and more scalable basis for training-free recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Reviews Matter for Recommendations in the Era of Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12978v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of large language models (LLMs), the landscape of recommender systems is undergoing a significant transformation. Traditionally, user reviews have served as a critical source of rich, contextual information for enhancing recommendation quality. However, as LLMs demonstrate an unprecedented ability to understand and generate human-like text, this raises the question of whether explicit user reviews remain essential in the era of LLMs. In this paper, we provide a systematic investigation of the evolving role of text reviews in recommendation by comparing deep learning methods and LLM approaches. Particularly, we conduct extensive experiments on eight public datasets with LLMs and evaluate their performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. We further introduce a benchmarking evaluation framework for review-aware recommender systems, RAREval, to comprehensively assess the contribution of textual reviews to the recommendation performance of review-aware recommender systems. Our framework examines various scenarios, including the removal of some or all textual reviews, random distortion, as well as recommendation performance in data sparsity and cold-start user settings. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of functioning as effective review-aware recommendation engines, generally outperforming traditional deep learning approaches, particularly in scenarios characterized by data sparsity and cold-start conditions. In addition, the removal of some or all textual reviews and random distortion does not necessarily lead to declines in recommendation accuracy. These findings motivate a rethinking of how user preference from text reviews can be more effectively leveraged.

Among various recommendation approaches, k-nearest-neighbor (kNN)-based collaborative filtering (CF) remains one of the most widely used in practice. However, the kNN scheme often results in running the algorithm on a highly dense graph, which degrades computational efficiency. In addition, enforcing a uniform neighborhood size is not well suited to capturing the true underlying structure of the data. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in graph signal processing (GSP) to learn a sparse yet high-quality graph, improving the efficiency of collaborative filtering without sacrificing recommendation accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can successfully perform CF-based recommendation using an extremely sparse graph while maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> |  |

However, this success remains largely empirical, with limited theoretical understanding. In this paper, we investigate the generalizability -- a theoretical measure of model performance in statistical learning -- of multivariate linear regression and LAEs. We first propose a PAC-Bayes bound for multivariate linear regression, extending the earlier bound for single-output linear regression by Shalaeva et al., and establish sufficient conditions for its convergence. We then show that LAEs, when evaluated under a relaxed mean squared error, can be interpreted as constrained multivariate linear regression models on bounded data, to which our bound adapts. Furthermore, we develop theoretical methods to improve the computational efficiency of optimizing the LAE bound, enabling its practical evaluation on large models and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our bound is tight and correlates well with practical ranking metrics such as Recall@K and NDCG@K.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 (https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1zkFSby8G)</p></details> |

Traditional approaches often fail to account for the intricate interactions within cyber-social systems and lack the flexibility to generalize across diverse domains, highlighting the need for more adaptive and versatile solutions. In this work, we introduce a general-purpose swarm intelligence algorithm for recommendation systems, designed to adapt seamlessly to varying applications. It was inspired by social psychology principles. The framework models user preferences and community influences within a dynamic hypergraph structure. It leverages centrality-based feature extraction and Node2Vec embeddings. Preference evolution is guided by message-passing mechanisms and hierarchical graph modeling, enabling real-time adaptation to changing behaviors. Experimental evaluations demonstrated the algorithm's superior performance in various recommendation tasks, including social networks and content discovery. Key metrics such as Hit Rate (HR), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) consistently outperformed baseline methods across multiple datasets. The model's adaptability to dynamic environments allowed for contextually relevant and precise recommendations. The proposed algorithm represents an advancement in recommendation systems by bridging individual preferences and community influences. Its general-purpose design enables applications in diverse domains, including social graphs, personalized learning, and medical graphs. This work highlights the potential of integrating swarm intelligence with network dynamics to address complex optimization challenges in recommendation systems.</p></details> | 49 pages, 15 figures |

HHFT addresses the limitations of DNN through three key designs: (1) Semantic Feature Partitioning: Grouping heterogeneous features (e.g. user profile, item information, behaviour sequennce) into semantically coherent blocks to preserve domain-specific information; (2) Heterogeneous Transformer Encoder: Adopting block-specific QKV projections and FFNs to avoid semantic confusion between distinct feature types; (3) Hiformer Layer: Capturing high-order interactions across features. Our findings reveal that Transformers significantly outperform DNN baselines, achieving a +0.4% improvement in CTR AUC at scale.

For example, in a mobile shopping interface, users interact with recommendations by scrolling, where each scroll triggers a list of items called slate. Users incur an evaluation cost - time spent assessing item features before deciding to click. Highly relevant items having higher evaluation costs may not fit within the user's time budget, affecting engagement. In this position paper, our objective is to evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms that learn patterns in user preferences and time budgets simultaneously, crafting recommendations with higher engagement potential under resource constraints. Our experiments explore the use of reinforcement learning to recommend items for users using Alibaba's Personalized Re-ranking dataset supporting slate optimization in e-commerce contexts. Our contributions include (i) a unified formulation of time-constrained slate recommendation modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with budget-aware utilities; (ii) a simulation framework to study policy behavior on re-ranking data; and (iii) empirical evidence that on-policy and off-policy control can improve performance under tight time budgets than traditional contextual bandit-based methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Deep learning techniques, such as RNNs, GNNs, and Transformer architectures, have significantly propelled the advancement of recommender systems by enhancing their comprehension of user behaviors and preferences. However, supervised learning methods encounter challenges in real-life scenarios due to data sparsity, resulting in limitations in their ability to learn representations effectively. To address this, self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have emerged as a solution, leveraging inherent data structures to generate supervision signals without relying solely on labeled data. By leveraging unlabeled data and extracting meaningful representations, recommender systems utilizing SSL can make accurate predictions and recommendations even when confronted with data sparsity. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of self-supervised learning frameworks designed for recommender systems, encompassing a thorough analysis of over 170 papers. We conduct an exploration of nine distinct scenarios, enabling a comprehensive understanding of SSL-enhanced recommenders in different contexts. For each domain, we elaborate on different self-supervised learning paradigms, namely contrastive learning, generative learning, and adversarial learning, so as to present technical details of how SSL enhances recommender systems in various contexts.

However, the heterogeneous and multifaceted nature of real-world data inevitably renders the distribution of relations long-tailed, making it crucial to complete missing facts with limited samples. Previous studies mainly based on metric matching or meta learning, yet they either fail to fully exploit neighborhood information in graph or overlook the distributional characteristics of contrastive signals. In this paper, we re-examine the problem from a perspective of generative representation and propose a few-shot knowledge graph completion framework that integrates two-stage attention triple enhancer with U-KAN based diffusion model. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that our method achieve new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

We introduce STARS, a transformer-based sequential recommendation framework built for large-scale, low-latency ecommerce settings. STARS combines several innovations: dual-memory user embeddings that separate long-term preferences from short-term session intent; semantic item tokens that fuse pretrained text embeddings, learnable deltas, and LLM-derived attribute tags, strengthening content-based matching, long-tail coverage, and cold-start performance; context-aware scoring with learned calendar and event offsets; and a latency-conscious two-stage retrieval pipeline that performs offline embedding generation and online maximum inner-product search with filtering, enabling tens-of-milliseconds response times.

| **[Exploring the Upper Limits of Text-Based Collaborative Filtering Using Large Language Models: Discoveries and Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11700v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based collaborative filtering (TCF) has emerged as the prominent technique for text and news recommendation, employing language models (LMs) as text encoders to represent items. However, the current landscape of TCF models mainly relies on the utilization of relatively small or medium-sized LMs. The potential impact of using larger, more powerful language models (such as these with over 100 billion parameters) as item encoders on recommendation performance remains uncertain. Can we anticipate unprecedented results and discover new insights? To address this question, we undertake a comprehensive series of experiments aimed at exploring the performance limits of the TCF paradigm. Specifically, we progressively augment the scale of item encoders, ranging fromone hundred million to one hundred billion parameters, in order to reveal the scaling limits of the TCF paradigm. Moreover, we investigate whether these exceptionally large LMs have the potential to establish a universal item representation for the recommendation task, thereby revolutionizing the traditional ID paradigm, which is considered a significant obstacle to developing transferable "one model fits all" recommender models. Our study not only demonstrates positive results but also uncovers unexpected negative outcomes, illuminating the current state of the TCF paradigm within the community. These findings will evoke deep reflection and inspire further research on text-based recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Best of the Two Worlds: Harmonizing Semantic and Hash IDs for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10388v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS) typically assign unique Hash IDs (HID) to construct item embeddings. These HID embeddings effectively learn collaborative information from historical user-item interactions, making them vulnerable to situations where most items are rarely consumed (the long-tail problem). Recent methods that incorporate auxiliary information often suffer from noisy collaborative sharing caused by co-occurrence signals or semantic homogeneity caused by flat dense embeddings. Semantic IDs (SIDs), with their capability of code sharing and multi-granular semantic modeling, provide a promising alternative. However, the collaborative overwhelming phenomenon hinders the further development of SID-based methods. The quantization mechanisms commonly compromise the uniqueness of identifiers required for modeling head items, creating a performance seesaw between head and tail items. To address this dilemma, we propose \textbf{\name}, a novel framework that harmonizes the SID and HID. Specifically, we devise a dual-branch modeling architecture that enables the model to capture both the multi-granular semantics within SID while preserving the unique collaborative identity of HID. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-level alignment strategy that bridges the two representations, facilitating knowledge transfer and supporting robust preference modeling. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that \name~ effectively balances recommendation quality for both head and tail items while surpassing the existing baselines. The implementation code can be found online\footnote{https://github.com/ziwliu8/H2Rec}.</p></details> |  |

While efficient, this approach fails to incorporate a user's most recent actions, often resulting in stale recommendations. In this work, we present a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for intra-day personalization that selectively injects recent watch history at inference time without requiring model retraining. Our approach selectively overrides stale user features at inference time using the recent watch history, allowing the system to adapt instantly to evolving preferences. By reducing the personalization feedback loop from daily to intra-day, we observed a statistically significant 0.47% increase in key user engagement metrics which ranked among the most substantial engagement gains observed in recent experimentation cycles. To our knowledge, this is the first published evidence that intra-day personalization can drive meaningful impact in long-form video streaming service, providing a compelling alternative to full real-time architectures where model retraining is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>3rd I...</summary><p>3rd IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and Internet of Things, September 06-07, 2025, Central Michigan University, USA</p></details> |
| **[Where to Explore: A Reach and Cost-Aware Approach for Unbiased Data Collection in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14733v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration is essential to improve long-term recommendation quality, but it often degrades short-term business performance, especially in remote-first TV environments where users engage passively, expect instant relevance, and offer few chances for correction. This paper introduces an approach for delivering content-level exploration safely and efficiently by optimizing its placement based on reach and opportunity cost. Deployed on a large-scale streaming platform with over 100 million monthly active users, our approach identifies scroll-depth regions with lower engagement and strategically introduces a dedicated container, the "Something Completely Different" row containing randomized content. Rather than enforcing exploration uniformly across the user interface (UI), we condition its appearance on empirically low-cost, high-reach positions to ensure minimal tradeoff against platform-level watch time goals. Extensive A/B testing shows that this strategy preserves business metrics while collecting unbiased interaction data. Our method complements existing intra-row diversification and bandit-based exploration techniques by introducing a deployable, behaviorally informed mechanism for surfacing exploratory content at scale. Moreover, we demonstrate that the collected unbiased data, integrated into downstream candidate generation, significantly improves user engagement, validating its value for recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Conference on Cognitive Machine Intelligence Nov. 11-14, 2025, Pittsburgh, PA, USA</p></details> |
| **[Understanding Toxic Interaction Across User and Video Clusters in Social Video Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10233v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social video platforms shape how people access information, while recommendation systems can narrow exposure and increase the risk of toxic interaction. Previous research has often examined text or users in isolation, overlooking the structural context in which such toxic interactions occur. Without considering who interacts with whom and around what content, it is difficult to explain why negative expressions cluster within particular communities. To address this issue, this study focuses on the Chinese social video platform Bilibili, incorporating video-level information as the environment for user expression, modeling users and videos in an interaction matrix. After normalization and dimensionality reduction, we perform separate clustering on both sides of the video-user interaction matrix with K-means. Cluster assignments facilitate comparisons of user behavior, including message length, posting frequency, and source (barrage and comment), as well as textual features such as sentiment and toxicity, and video attributes defined by uploaders. Such a clustering approach integrates structural ties with content signals to identify stable groups of videos and users. We find clear stratification in interaction style (message length, comment ratio) across user clusters, while sentiment and toxicity differences are weak or inconsistent across video clusters. Across video clusters, viewing volume exhibits a clear hierarchy, with higher exposure groups concentrating more toxic expressions. For such a group, platforms should require timely intervention during periods of rapid growth. Across user clusters, comment ratio and message length form distinct hierarchies, and several clusters with longer and comment-oriented messages exhibit lower toxicity. For such groups, platforms should strengthen mechanisms that sustain rational dialogue and encourage engagement across topics.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE BigData 2025 Workshop : The 10th International Workshop on Application of Big Data for Computational Social Science (ABCSS 2025)</p></details> |

We present an agent-based simulator where content production, tie formation, and a graph attention network (GAT) recommender co-evolve in a closed loop. We calibrate parameters using Mastodon data and validate out-of-sample against Bluesky (4--6\% error on structural metrics; 10--15\% on held-out temporal splits). Across 18 configurations at 100 agents, we find that \emph{activation timing} affects outcomes: introducing recommendations at $t=10$ vs.\ $t=40$ decreases transitivity by 10\% while engagement differs by $<$8\%. Delaying activation increases content diversity by 9\% while reducing modularity by 4\%. Scaling experiments ($n$ up to 5,000) show the effect persists but attenuates. Jacobian analysis confirms local stability under bounded reactance parameters. We release configuration schemas and reproduction scripts.</p></details> |  |
| **[A survey on the impacts of recommender systems on users, items, and human-AI ecosystems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01630v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems and assistants (in short, recommenders) influence through online platforms most actions of our daily lives, suggesting items or providing solutions based on users' preferences or requests. This survey systematically reviews, categories, and discusses the impact of recommenders in four human-AI ecosystems -- social media, online retail, urban mapping and generative AI ecosystems. Its scope is to systematise a fast-growing field in which terminologies employed to classify methodologies and outcomes are fragmented and unsystematic. This is a crucial contribution to the literature because terminologies vary substantially across disciplines and ecosystems, hindering comparison and accumulation of knowledge in the field. We follow the customary steps of qualitative systematic review, gathering 154 articles from different disciplines to develop a parsimonious taxonomy of methodologies employed (empirical, simulation, observational, controlled), outcomes observed (concentration, content degradation, discrimination, diversity, echo chamber, filter bubble, homogenisation, polarisation, radicalisation, volume), and their level of analysis (individual, item, and ecosystem). We systematically discuss substantive and methodological commonalities across ecosystems, and highlight potential avenues for future research. The survey is addressed to scholars and practitioners interested in different human-AI ecosystems, policymakers and institutional stakeholders who want to understand better the measurable outcomes of recommenders, and tech companies who wish to obtain a systematic view of the impact of their recommenders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering: Orchestrating Users and Items for Agentic Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18413v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic recommendations cast recommenders as large language model (LLM) agents that can plan, reason, use tools, and interact with users of varying preferences in web applications. However, most existing agentic recommender systems focus on generic single-agent plan-execute workflows or multi-agent task decomposition pipelines. Without recommendation-oriented design, they often underuse the collaborative signals in the user-item interaction history, leading to unsatisfying recommendation results. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework for agentic recommendations, drawing an analogy between traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, given a target user and query, we instantiate similar users and relevant items as LLM agents with unique profiles. Each agent is able to call retrieval tools, suggest candidate items, and interact with other agents. Different from the static preference aggregation in traditional collaborative filtering, MACF employs a central orchestrator agent to adaptively manage the collaboration between user and item agents via dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instruction. Experimental results on datasets from three different domains show the advantages of our MACF framework compared to strong agentic recommendation baselines.</p></details> |  |

Instead of predicting modality-tailored targets such as textual tokens or speech units, Pantagruel learns contextualized target representations in the feature space, allowing modality-specific encoders to capture linguistic and acoustic regularities more effectively. Separate models are pre-trained on large-scale French corpora, including Wikipedia, OSCAR and CroissantLLM for text, together with MultilingualLibriSpeech, LeBenchmark, and INA-100k for speech. INA-100k is a newly introduced 100,000-hour corpus of French audio derived from the archives of the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel (INA), the national repository of French radio and television broadcasts, providing highly diverse audio data. We evaluate Pantagruel across a broad range of downstream tasks spanning both modalities, including those from the standard French benchmarks such as FLUE or LeBenchmark. Across these tasks, Pantagruel models show competitive or superior performance compared to strong French baselines such as CamemBERT, FlauBERT, and LeBenchmark2.0, while maintaining a shared architecture that can seamlessly handle either speech or text inputs. These results confirm the effectiveness of feature-space self-supervised objectives for French representation learning and highlight Pantagruel as a robust foundation for multimodal speech-text understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Latent Diffusion Models via Disentangled Representation Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05823v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) generate high-quality images by operating in a compressed latent space, typically obtained through image tokenizers such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In pursuit of a generation-friendly VAE, recent studies have explored leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as representation alignment targets for VAEs, mirroring the approach commonly adopted for LDMs. Although this yields certain performance gains, using the same alignment target for both VAEs and LDMs overlooks their fundamentally different representational requirements. We advocate that while LDMs benefit from latents retaining high-level semantic concepts, VAEs should excel in semantic disentanglement, enabling encoding of attribute-level information in a structured way. To address this, we propose the Semantic disentangled VAE (Send-VAE), explicitly optimized for disentangled representation learning through aligning its latent space with the semantic hierarchy of pre-trained VFMs. Our approach employs a non-linear mapper network to transform VAE latents, aligning them with VFMs to bridge the gap between attribute-level disentanglement and high-level semantics, facilitating effective guidance for VAE learning. We evaluate semantic disentanglement via linear probing on attribute prediction tasks, showing strong correlation with improved generation performance. Finally, using Send-VAE, we train flow-based transformers SiTs; experiments show Send-VAE significantly speeds up training and achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.21 and 1.75 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256x256.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dual Pipeline Machine Learning Framework for Automated Multi Class Sleep Disorder Screening Using Hybrid Resampling and Ensemble Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05814v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of sleep disorders, particularly insomnia and sleep apnea, is important for reducing long term health risks and improving patient quality of life. However, clinical sleep studies are resource intensive and are difficult to scale for population level screening. This paper presents a Dual Pipeline Machine Learning Framework for multi class sleep disorder screening using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset. The framework consists of two parallel processing streams: a statistical pipeline that targets linear separability using Mutual Information and Linear Discriminant Analysis, and a wrapper based pipeline that applies Boruta feature selection with an autoencoder for non linear representation learning. To address class imbalance, we use the hybrid SMOTETomek resampling strategy. In experiments, Extra Trees and K Nearest Neighbors achieved an accuracy of 98.67%, outperforming recent baselines on the same dataset. Statistical testing using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test indicates that the improvement over baseline configurations is significant, and inference latency remains below 400 milliseconds. These results suggest that the proposed dual pipeline design supports accurate and efficient automated screening for non invasive sleep disorder risk stratification.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |

Each observation is first reconstructed as a linear combination of the other samples in the RKHS, by optimizing a vector form of the Representer Theorem for their autorepresentation property. A separable operator-valued kernel extends the formulation to vector-valued data while retaining the simplicity of a single scalar similarity function. A subsequent kernel-alignment task projects the data into a lower-dimensional latent space whose Gram matrix aims to match the high-dimensional reconstruction kernel, thus transferring the auto-reconstruction geometry of the RKHS to the embedding. Therefore, the proposed algorithms represent an extended approach to the autorepresentation property, exhibited by many natural data, by using and adapting well-known results of Kernel Learning Theory. Numerical experiments on both simulated (concentric circles and swiss-roll) and real (cancer molecular activity and IoT network intrusions) datasets provide empirical evidence of the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Disentangled Representation Learning for Incomplete Multi-View Multi-Label Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05785v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view multi-label learning frequently suffers from simultaneous feature absence and incomplete annotations, due to challenges in data acquisition and cost-intensive supervision. To tackle the complex yet highly practical problem while overcoming the existing limitations of feature recovery, representation disentanglement, and label semantics modeling, we propose an Adaptive Disentangled Representation Learning method (ADRL). ADRL achieves robust view completion by propagating feature-level affinity across modalities with neighborhood awareness, and reinforces reconstruction effectiveness by leveraging a stochastic masking strategy. Through disseminating category-level association across label distributions, ADRL refines distribution parameters for capturing interdependent label prototypes. Besides, we formulate a mutual-information-based objective to promote consistency among shared representations and suppress information overlap between view-specific representation and other modalities. Theoretically, we derive the tractable bounds to train the dual-channel network. Moreover, ADRL performs prototype-specific feature selection by enabling independent interactions between label embeddings and view representations, accompanied by the generation of pseudo-labels for each category. The structural characteristics of the pseudo-label space are then exploited to guide a discriminative trade-off during view fusion. Finally, extensive experiments on public datasets and real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of ADRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[StriderSPD: Structure-Guided Joint Representation Learning for Binary Security Patch Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05772v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vulnerabilities severely threaten software systems, making the timely application of security patches crucial for mitigating attacks. However, software vendors often silently patch vulnerabilities with limited disclosure, where Security Patch Detection (SPD) comes to protect software assets. Recently, most SPD studies have targeted Open-Source Software (OSS), yet a large portion of real-world software is closed-source, where patches are distributed as binaries without accessible source code. The limited binary SPD approaches often lift binaries to abstraction levels, i.e., assembly code or pseudo-code. However, assembly code is register-based instructions conveying limited semantics, while pseudo-code lacks parser-compatible grammar to extract structure, both hindering accurate vulnerability-fix representation learning. In addition, previous studies often obtain training and testing data from the same project for evaluation, which fails to reflect closed-source conditions. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose \textbf{\textit{StriderSPD}}, a \underline{Str}ucture-gu\underline{ide}d joint \underline{r}epresentation \underline{SPD} framework of binary code that integrates a graph branch into a large language model (LLM), leveraging structural information to guide the LLM in identifying security patches. Our novel design of the adapters in the graph branch effectively aligns the representations between assembly code and pseudo-code at the LLM's token level. We further present a two-stage training strategy to address the optimization imbalance caused by the large parameter disparity between StriderSPD's two branches, which enables proper branch fitting. To enable more realistic evaluation, we construct a binary SPD benchmark that is disjoint from prior datasets in both projects and domains and extensively evaluate StriderSPD on this benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGDrive: Scene-to-Goal Hierarchical World Cognition for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05640v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent end-to-end autonomous driving approaches have leveraged Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance planning capabilities in complex driving scenarios. However, VLMs are inherently trained as generalist models, lacking specialized understanding of driving-specific reasoning in 3D space and time. When applied to autonomous driving, these models struggle to establish structured spatial-temporal representations that capture geometric relationships, scene context, and motion patterns critical for safe trajectory planning. To address these limitations, we propose SGDrive, a novel framework that explicitly structures the VLM's representation learning around driving-specific knowledge hierarchies. Built upon a pre-trained VLM backbone, SGDrive decomposes driving understanding into a scene-agent-goal hierarchy that mirrors human driving cognition: drivers first perceive the overall environment (scene context), then attend to safety-critical agents and their behaviors, and finally formulate short-term goals before executing actions. This hierarchical decomposition provides the structured spatial-temporal representation that generalist VLMs lack, integrating multi-level information into a compact yet comprehensive format for trajectory planning. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that SGDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance among camera-only methods on both PDMS and EPDMS, validating the effectiveness of hierarchical knowledge structuring for adapting generalist VLMs to autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

We propose Temporal-aware Matryoshka Representation Learning (TMRL), an efficient method that equips retrievers with temporal-aware Matryoshka embeddings. TMRL leverages the nested structure of Matryoshka embeddings to introduce a temporal subspace, enhancing temporal encoding while preserving general semantic representations. Experiments show that TMRL efficiently adapts diverse text embedding models, achieving competitive temporal retrieval and temporal RAG performance compared to prior Matryoshka-based non-temporal methods and prior temporal methods, while enabling flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Although natural language processing techniques, such as recurrent neural networks, and self-attention, have been adapted for learning medical representations from hierarchical, time-stamped EHR data, they often struggle when either general or task-specific data are limited. Recent efforts have attempted to mitigate this challenge by incorporating medical ontologies (i.e., knowledge graphs) into self-supervised tasks like diagnosis prediction. However, two main issues remain: (1) small and uniform ontologies that lack diversity for robust learning, and (2) insufficient attention to the critical contexts or dependencies underlying patient journeys, which could further enhance ontology-based learning. To address these gaps, we propose MIPO (Mutual Integration of Patient Journey and Medical Ontology), a robust end-to-end framework that employs a Transformer-based architecture for representation learning. MIPO emphasizes task-specific representation learning through a sequential diagnosis prediction task, while also incorporating an ontology-based disease-typing task. A graph-embedding module is introduced to integrate information from patient visit records, thus alleviating data insufficiency. This setup creates a mutually reinforcing loop, where both patient-journey embedding and ontology embedding benefit from each other. We validate MIPO on two real-world benchmark datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms baseline methods under both sufficient and limited data conditions. Furthermore, the resulting diagnosis embeddings offer improved interpretability, underscoring the promise of MIPO for real-world healthcare applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, accepted for IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

Previous research has linked this delayed generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, novel-view synthesis has seen major advances with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), where models learn a compact representation from 2D images to render 3D scenes, albeit at the cost of larger models and intensive training. In this work, we extend the approach of QVFs by introducing QNeRF, the first hybrid quantum-classical model designed for novel-view synthesis from 2D images. QNeRF leverages parameterised quantum circuits to encode spatial and view-dependent information via quantum superposition and entanglement, resulting in more compact models compared to the classical counterpart. We present two architectural variants. Full QNeRF maximally exploits all quantum amplitudes to enhance representational capabilities. In contrast, Dual-Branch QNeRF introduces a task-informed inductive bias by branching spatial and view-dependent quantum state preparations, drastically reducing the complexity of this operation and ensuring scalability and potential hardware compatibility. Our experiments demonstrate that -- when trained on images of moderate resolution -- QNeRF matches or outperforms classical NeRF baselines while using less than half the number of parameters. These results suggest that quantum machine learning can serve as a competitive alternative for continuous signal representation in mid-level tasks in computer vision, such as 3D representation learning from 2D observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 15 figures, 11 tables; project page: https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/QNeRF/</p></details> |

To bridge this gap in care, we developed and prospectively trialed a multi-modal AI framework for remote patient monitoring (RPM). This system integrates multi-modal data from the HALO-X platform, such as demographics, wearable sensors, daily surveys, and clinical events. Our observational trial is one of the largest of its kind and has collected over 2.1 million data points (6,080 patient-days) of monitoring from 84 patients. We developed and adapted a multi-modal AI model to handle the asynchronous and incomplete nature of real-world RPM data, forecasting a continuous risk of future adverse events. The model achieved an accuracy of 83.9% (AUROC=0.70). Notably, the model identified previous treatments, wellness check-ins, and daily maximum heart rate as key predictive features. A case study demonstrated the model's ability to provide early warnings by outputting escalating risk profiles prior to the event. This work establishes the feasibility of multi-modal AI RPM for cancer care and offers a path toward more proactive patient support.(Accepted at Europe NeurIPS 2025 Multimodal Representation Learning for Healthcare Workshop.

However, existing methods focus primarily on modality-shared features, neglecting the modality-specific features during the pre-training process, which leads to suboptimal representations. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the limitations of current contrastive methods for 3D representation learning and propose a new framework, namely CMCR (Cross-Modal Comprehensive Representation Learning), to address these shortcomings. Our approach improves upon traditional methods by better integrating both modality-shared and modality-specific features. Specifically, we introduce masked image modeling and occupancy estimation tasks to guide the network in learning more comprehensive modality-specific features. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal unified codebook that learns an embedding space shared across different modalities. Besides, we introduce geometry-enhanced masked image modeling to further boost 3D representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method mitigates the challenges faced by traditional approaches and consistently outperforms existing image-to-LiDAR contrastive distillation methods in downstream tasks.

Together, they provide an end-to-end pipeline for high-precision multimodal search by mapping diverse modalities, including text, images, document images, and video, into a unified representation space. The Qwen3-VL-Embedding model employs a multi-stage training paradigm, progressing from large-scale contrastive pre-training to reranking model distillation, to generate semantically rich high-dimensional vectors. It supports Matryoshka Representation Learning, enabling flexible embedding dimensions, and handles inputs up to 32k tokens. Complementing this, Qwen3-VL-Reranker performs fine-grained relevance estimation for query-document pairs using a cross-encoder architecture with cross-attention mechanisms. Both model series inherit the multilingual capabilities of Qwen3-VL, supporting more than 30 languages, and are released in $\textbf{2B}$ and $\textbf{8B}$ parameter sizes to accommodate diverse deployment requirements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3-VL-Embedding series achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse multimodal embedding evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, Qwen3-VL-Embedding-8B attains an overall score of $\textbf{77.8}$ on MMEB-V2, ranking first among all models (as of January 8, 2025). This report presents the architecture, training methodology, and practical capabilities of the series, demonstrating their effectiveness on various multimodal retrieval tasks, including image-text retrieval, visual question answering, and video-text matching.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions remain limited by long running time or insufficient schedule quality, especially when problem scale increases. In this paper, we propose ReLA, a reinforcement-learning (RL) scheduler built on structured representation learning and aggregation. ReLA first learns diverse representations from scheduling entities, including job operations and machines, using two intra-entity learning modules with self-attention and convolution and one inter-entity learning module with cross-attention. These modules are applied in a multi-scale architecture, and their outputs are aggregated to support RL decision-making. Across experiments on small, medium, and large job instances, ReLA achieves the best makespan in most tested settings over the latest solutions. On non-large instances, ReLA reduces the optimality gap of the SOTA baseline by 13.0%, while on large-scale instances it reduces the gap by 78.6%, with the average optimality gaps lowered to 7.3% and 2.1%, respectively. These results confirm that ReLA's learned representations and aggregation provide strong decision support for RL scheduling, and enable fast job completion and decision-making for real-world applications.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[GCR: Geometry-Consistent Routing for Task-Agnostic Continual Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01856v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature-based anomaly detection is widely adopted in industrial inspection due to the strong representational power of large pre-trained vision encoders. While most existing methods focus on improving within-category anomaly scoring, practical deployments increasingly require task-agnostic operation under continual category expansion, where the category identity is unknown at test time. In this setting, overall performance is often dominated by expert selection, namely routing an input to an appropriate normality model before any head-specific scoring is applied. However, routing rules that compare head-specific anomaly scores across independently constructed heads are unreliable in practice, as score distributions can differ substantially across categories in scale and tail behavior. We propose GCR, a lightweight mixture-of-experts framework for stabilizing task-agnostic continual anomaly detection through geometry-consistent routing. GCR routes each test image directly in a shared frozen patch-embedding space by minimizing an accumulated nearest-prototype distance to category-specific prototype banks, and then computes anomaly maps only within the routed expert using a standard prototype-based scoring rule. By separating cross-head decision making from within-head anomaly scoring, GCR avoids cross-head score comparability issues without requiring end-to-end representation learning. Experiments on MVTec AD and VisA show that geometry-consistent routing substantially improves routing stability and mitigates continual performance collapse, achieving near-zero forgetting while maintaining competitive detection and localization performance. These results indicate that many failures previously attributed to representation forgetting can instead be explained by decision-rule instability in cross-head routing.

Recent advances in deep learning address this challenge by representing MILP instances as variable-constraint bipartite graphs and applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to extract latent structural patterns and enhance solver efficiency. However, this architecture is inherently limited by the local-oriented mechanism, leading to restricted representation power and hindering neural approaches for MILP. Here we present an attention-driven neural architecture that learns expressive representations beyond the pure graph view. A dual-attention mechanism is designed to perform parallel self- and cross-attention over variables and constraints, enabling global information exchange and deeper representation learning. We apply this general backbone to various downstream tasks at the instance level, element level, and solving state level. Extensive experiments across widely used benchmarks show consistent improvements of our approach over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting attention-based neural architectures as a powerful foundation for learning-enhanced mixed-integer linear optimization.</p></details> |  |

To tackle it, we introduce the first generalized cross-domain few-shot (GCFS) task in 3D object detection, aiming to adapt a source-pretrained model to both common and novel classes in a new domain with only few-shot annotations. We propose a unified framework that learns stable target semantics under limited supervision by bridging 2D open-set semantics with 3D spatial reasoning. Specifically, an image-guided multi-modal fusion injects transferable 2D semantic cues into the 3D pipeline via vision-language models, while a physically-aware box search enhances 2D-to-3D alignment via LiDAR priors. To capture class-specific semantics from sparse data, we further introduce contrastive-enhanced prototype learning, which encodes few-shot instances into discriminative semantic anchors and stabilizes representation learning. Extensive experiments on GCFS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach in realistic deployment settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The l...</summary><p>The latest version refines the few-shot setting on common classes, enforcing a stricter object-level definition</p></details> |

We present an analytics-first framework that separates content signals from rater tendencies, making judgments visible and auditable via analytics. Using de-identified ASSISTments mathematics responses, we model teacher histories as dynamic priors and represent text with sentence embeddings. We apply centroid normalization and response-problem embedding differences, and explicitly model teacher effects with priors to reduce problem- and teacher-related confounds. Temporally-validated linear models quantify the contributions of each signal, and model disagreements surface observations for qualitative inspection. Results show that teacher priors heavily influence grade predictions; the strongest results arise when priors are combined with content embeddings (AUC~0.815), while content-only models remain above chance but substantially weaker (AUC~0.626). Adjusting for rater effects sharpens the selection of features derived from content representations, retaining more informative embedding dimensions and revealing cases where semantic evidence supports understanding as opposed to surface-level differences in how students respond. The contribution presents a practical pipeline that transforms embeddings from mere features into learning analytics for reflection, enabling teachers and researchers to examine where grading practices align (or conflict) with evidence of student reasoning and learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short research paper accepted at Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK '26)</p></details> |
| **[UNIC: Learning Unified Multimodal Extrinsic Contact Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04356v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact-rich manipulation requires reliable estimation of extrinsic contacts-the interactions between a grasped object and its environment which provide essential contextual information for planning, control, and policy learning. However, existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as predefined contact types, fixed grasp configurations, or camera calibration, that hinder generalization to novel objects and deployment in unstructured environments. In this paper, we present UNIC, a unified multimodal framework for extrinsic contact estimation that operates without any prior knowledge or camera calibration. UNIC directly encodes visual observations in the camera frame and integrates them with proprioceptive and tactile modalities in a fully data-driven manner. It introduces a unified contact representation based on scene affordance maps that captures diverse contact formations and employs a multimodal fusion mechanism with random masking, enabling robust multimodal representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UNIC performs reliably. It achieves a 9.6 mm average Chamfer distance error on unseen contact locations, performs well on unseen objects, remains robust under missing modalities, and adapts to dynamic camera viewpoints. These results establish extrinsic contact estimation as a practical and versatile capability for contact-rich manipulation.</p></details> |  |

In this context, Graph Neural Networks are a promising solution due to their ability to learn from graph-structured data. Combined with Reinforcement Learning, they can be used as control approaches to determine remedial actions. This review analyses how Graph Reinforcement Learning can improve representation learning and decision-making in power grid applications, particularly transmission and distribution grids. We analyze the reviewed approaches in terms of the graph structure, the Graph Neural Network architecture, and the Reinforcement Learning approach. Although Graph Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated adaptability to unpredictable events and noisy data, its current stage is primarily proof-of-concept, and it is not yet deployable to real-world applications.

| **[Rethinking Jailbreak Detection of Large Vision Language Models with Representational Contrastive Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12069v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to a growing array of multimodal jailbreak attacks, necessitating defenses that are both generalizable to novel threats and efficient for practical deployment. Many current strategies fall short, either targeting specific attack patterns, which limits generalization, or imposing high computational overhead. While lightweight anomaly-detection methods offer a promising direction, we find that their common one-class design tends to confuse novel benign inputs with malicious ones, leading to unreliable over-rejection. To address this, we propose Representational Contrastive Scoring (RCS), a framework built on a key insight: the most potent safety signals reside within the LVLM's own internal representations. Our approach inspects the internal geometry of these representations, learning a lightweight projection to maximally separate benign and malicious inputs in safety-critical layers. This enables a simple yet powerful contrastive score that differentiates true malicious intent from mere novelty. Our instantiations, MCD (Mahalanobis Contrastive Detection) and KCD (K-nearest Contrastive Detection), achieve state-of-the-art performance on a challenging evaluation protocol designed to test generalization to unseen attack types. This work demonstrates that effective jailbreak detection can be achieved by applying simple, interpretable statistical methods to the appropriate internal representations, offering a practical path towards safer LVLM deployment.

We introduce PointWorld, a large pre-trained 3D world model that unifies state and action in a shared 3D space as 3D point flows: given one or few RGB-D images and a sequence of low-level robot action commands, PointWorld forecasts per-pixel displacements in 3D that respond to the given actions. By representing actions as 3D point flows instead of embodiment-specific action spaces (e.g., joint positions), this formulation directly conditions on physical geometries of robots while seamlessly integrating learning across embodiments. To train our 3D world model, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning real and simulated robotic manipulation in open-world environments, enabled by recent advances in 3D vision and simulated environments, totaling about 2M trajectories and 500 hours across a single-arm Franka and a bimanual humanoid. Through rigorous, large-scale empirical studies of backbones, action representations, learning objectives, partial observability, data mixtures, domain transfers, and scaling, we distill design principles for large-scale 3D world modeling. With a real-time (0.1s) inference speed, PointWorld can be efficiently integrated in the model-predictive control (MPC) framework for manipulation. We demonstrate that a single pre-trained checkpoint enables a real-world Franka robot to perform rigid-body pushing, deformable and articulated object manipulation, and tool use, without requiring any demonstrations or post-training and all from a single image captured in-the-wild.

| **[Inductive Graph Representation Learning with Quantum Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24111v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) offer a promising approach to combining quantum computing with graph-structured data processing. While classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are scalable and robust, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum circuit designs, limiting their applicability to diverse real-world problems. To address this, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by GraphSAGE, using quantum models as aggregators. We integrate inductive representation learning techniques with parameterized quantum convolutional and pooling layers, bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer is flexible, allowing tailored designs for specific tasks. Benchmarked on a node regression task with the QM9 dataset, our framework, using a single minimal circuit for all aggregation steps, handles molecules with varying numbers of atoms without changing qubits or circuit architecture. While classical GNNs achieve higher training performance, our quantum approach remains competitive and often shows stronger generalization as molecular complexity increases. We also observe faster learning in early training epochs. To mitigate trainability limitations of a single-circuit setup, we extend the framework with multiple quantum aggregators on QM9. Assigning distinct circuits to each hop substantially improves training performance across all cases. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus as qubit numbers increase, suggesting that the proposed model can scale to larger, more complex graph-based problems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |
| **[BiListing: Modality Alignment for Listings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20396v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model. However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images, various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews, making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a single representation. This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both. We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production, achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental revenue.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inferring Clinically Relevant Molecular Subtypes of Pancreatic Cancer from Routine Histopathology Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03410v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular subtyping of PDAC into basal-like and classical has established prognostic and predictive value. However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping. We are gathering data from two institutions to validate and assess real-world performance, supporting integration into digital pathology workflows and advancing precision oncology for PDAC.</p></details> |  |

This monograph provides a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical treatment of attention mechanisms, encompassing their theoretical foundations, computational properties, and practical implementations in contemporary deep learning systems. Applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning demonstrate the versatility of attention mechanisms. We examine language modeling with autoregressive transformers, bidirectional encoders for representation learning, sequence-to-sequence translation, Vision Transformers for image classification, and cross-modal attention for vision-language tasks. Empirical analysis reveals training characteristics, scaling laws that relate performance to model size and computation, attention pattern visualizations, and performance benchmarks across standard datasets. We discuss the interpretability of learned attention patterns and their relationship to linguistic and visual structures. The monograph concludes with a critical examination of current limitations, including computational scalability, data efficiency, systematic generalization, and interpretability challenges.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), a novel, biologically inspired CT-Attention mechanism that reformulates attention logit computation as the solution to a linear first-order ODE with nonlinear interlinked gates derived from repurposing C.elegans Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) wiring. NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing content-target and learnable time-constant gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. To improve efficiency and memory consumption, we implemented an adaptable subquadratic sparse Top-K pairwise concatenation mechanism that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability and bounded approximation errors. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics. We observed that NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy and occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory consumption compared with several CT state-of-the-art baselines, while being interpretable at the neuron cell level.</p></details> | Ongoing work |
| **[Causal Manifold Fairness: Enforcing Geometric Invariance in Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03032v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness in machine learning is increasingly critical, yet standard approaches often treat data as static points in a high-dimensional space, ignoring the underlying generative structure. We posit that sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) do not merely shift data distributions but causally warp the geometry of the data manifold itself. To address this, we introduce Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF), a novel framework that bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning. CMF learns a latent representation where the local Riemannian geometry, defined by the metric tensor and curvature, remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes. By enforcing constraints on the Jacobian and Hessian of the decoder, CMF ensures that the rules of the latent space (distances and shapes) are preserved across demographic groups. We validate CMF on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs), demonstrating that it effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, offering a rigorous quantification of the fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unbiased Cross-Modal Representation Learning for Food Image-to-Recipe Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15201v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges of learning representations for recipes and food images in the cross-modal retrieval problem. As the relationship between a recipe and its cooked dish is cause-and-effect, treating a recipe as a text source describing the visual appearance of a dish for learning representation, as the existing approaches, will create bias misleading image-and-recipe similarity judgment. Specifically, a food image may not equally capture every detail in a recipe, due to factors such as the cooking process, dish presentation, and image-capturing conditions. The current representation learning tends to capture dominant visual-text alignment while overlooking subtle variations that determine retrieval relevance. In this paper, we model such bias in cross-modal representation learning using causal theory. The causal view of this problem suggests ingredients as one of the confounder sources and a simple backdoor adjustment can alleviate the bias. By causal intervention, we reformulate the conventional model for food-to-recipe retrieval with an additional term to remove the potential bias in similarity judgment. Based on this theory-informed formulation, we empirically prove the oracle performance of retrieval on the Recipe1M dataset to be MedR=1 across the testing data sizes of 1K, 10K, and even 50K. We also propose a plug-and-play neural module, which is essentially a multi-label ingredient classifier for debiasing. New state-of-the-art search performances are reported on the Recipe1M dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code link: https://github.com/GZWQ/Towards-Unbiased-Cross-Modal-Representation-Learning-for-Food-Image-to-Recipe-Retrieval</p></details> |

GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms. This encourages a more compact representation and also facilitates efficient computation. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpikingGPF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric and Dynamic Scaling in Deep Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01014v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their empirical success, pushing Transformer architectures to extreme depth often leads to a paradoxical failure: representations become increasingly redundant, lose rank, and ultimately collapse. Existing explanations largely attribute this phenomenon to optimization instability or vanishing gradients, yet such accounts fail to explain why collapse persists even under modern normalization and initialization schemes. In this paper, we argue that the collapse of deep Transformers is fundamentally a geometric problem. Standard residual updates implicitly assume that feature accumulation is always beneficial, but offer no mechanism to constrain update directions or to erase outdated information. As depth increases, this leads to systematic drift off the semantic manifold and monotonic feature accumulation, causing representational degeneracy. We propose a unified geometric framework that addresses these failures through two orthogonal principles. First, manifold-constrained hyper-connections restrict residual updates to valid local tangent directions, preventing uncontrolled manifold drift. Second, deep delta learning introduces data-dependent, non-monotonic updates that enable reflection and erasure of redundant features rather than their unconditional accumulation. Together, these mechanisms decouple the direction and sign of feature updates, yielding a stable geometric evolution across depth. We term the resulting architecture the Manifold-Geometric Transformer (MGT). Our analysis predicts that enforcing geometric validity while allowing dynamic erasure is essential for avoiding rank collapse in ultra-deep networks. We outline an evaluation protocol for Transformers exceeding 100 layers to test the hypothesis that geometry, rather than depth itself, is the key limiting factor in deep representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Resea...</summary><p>Research Proposal Only</p></details> |
| **[Diminishing Returns in Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03862v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based architectures have become a dominant paradigm in vision and language, but their success is often attributed to large model capacity and massive training data. In this work, we examine how self-supervised pre-training, intermediate fine-tuning, and downstream fine-tuning interact in a low-capacity regime, using a 5M-parameter Vision Transformer for semantic segmentation. Across multiple data scales, we find that masked image modeling pre-training and downstream fine-tuning reliably improve performance, but with clear diminishing returns as supervision increases. In contrast, inserting an intermediate classification fine-tuning stage consistently degrades downstream performance, with the largest drops occurring precisely where pre-training is most effective. Through an analysis of patch-level representation geometry, we show that classification-based intermediate supervision actively interferes with representations learned during pre-training by collapsing spatial structure critical for dense prediction. These results indicate that, in small models, the geometry of supervision matters more than the number of training stages: misaligned intermediate objectives can negate the benefits of pre-training rather than amplify them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differential Privacy for Transformer Embeddings of Text with Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02307v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a privacy-preserving method for sharing text data by sharing noisy versions of their transformer embeddings. It has been shown that hidden representations learned by deep models can encode sensitive information from the input, making it possible for adversaries to recover the input data with considerable accuracy. This problem is exacerbated in transformer embeddings because they consist of multiple vectors, one per token. To mitigate this risk, we propose Nonparametric Variational Differential Privacy (NVDP), which ensures both useful data sharing and strong privacy protection. We take a differential privacy approach, integrating a Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck (NVIB) layer into the transformer architecture to inject noise into its multi-vector embeddings and thereby hide information, and measuring privacy protection with Rényi divergence and its corresponding Bayesian Differential Privacy (BDP) guarantee. Training the NVIB layer calibrates the noise level according to utility. We test NVDP on the GLUE benchmark and show that varying the noise level gives us a useful tradeoff between privacy and accuracy. With lower noise levels, our model maintains high accuracy while offering strong privacy guarantees, effectively balancing privacy and utility.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs), the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three canonical benchmarks our CPU-only implementation sets new state-of-the-art: WordNet nouns (52,427 leaves) 99.96% leaf accuracy in 16 min; GO molecular-function 96.9% leaf / 100% root in 50 s; NCBI Mammalia Spearman $ρ= -0.96$ with true taxonomic distance. The learned metric is perfectly ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for hierarchical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: C...</summary><p>v2: Corrected mathematical statements in Section 3.1.3 and Appendix A regarding the van der Put basis properties.

| **[Point-SRA: Self-Representation Alignment for 3D Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01746v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked autoencoders (MAE) have become a dominant paradigm in 3D representation learning, setting new performance benchmarks across various downstream tasks. Existing methods with fixed mask ratio neglect multi-level representational correlations and intrinsic geometric structures, while relying on point-wise reconstruction assumptions that conflict with the diversity of point cloud. To address these issues, we propose a 3D representation learning method, termed Point-SRA, which aligns representations through self-distillation and probabilistic modeling. Specifically, we assign different masking ratios to the MAE to capture complementary geometric and semantic information, while the MeanFlow Transformer (MFT) leverages cross-modal conditional embeddings to enable diverse probabilistic reconstruction. Our analysis further reveals that representations at different time steps in MFT also exhibit complementarity. Therefore, a Dual Self-Representation Alignment mechanism is proposed at both the MAE and MFT levels. Finally, we design a Flow-Conditioned Fine-Tuning Architecture to fully exploit the point cloud distribution learned via MeanFlow. Point-SRA outperforms Point-MAE by 5.37% on ScanObjectNN. On intracranial aneurysm segmentation, it reaches 96.07% mean IoU for arteries and 86.87% for aneurysms. For 3D object detection, Point-SRA achieves 47.3% AP@50, surpassing MaskPoint by 5.12%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an AAAI 2026 accepted paper titled "Point-SRA: Self-Representation Alignment for 3D Representation Learning", spanning 13 pages in total.

This morphology can be regarded as an SE(3)-invariant, denoised volumetric representation of subvolumes extracted from tomograms. Inferring morphology is therefore an inverse problem of estimating both a template morphology and its SE(3) transformation. Existing expectation-maximization based solution to this problem often misses rare but important morphologies and requires extensive manual hyperparameter tuning. Addressing this issue, we present a disentangled deep representation learning framework that separates SE(3) transformations from morphological content in the representation space. The framework includes a novel multi-choice learning module that enables this disentanglement for highly noisy cryo-ET data, and the learned morphological content is used to generate template morphologies. Experiments on simulated and real cryo-ET datasets demonstrate clear improvements over prior methods, including the discovery of previously unidentified macromolecular morphologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfMasking: Unleashing Synergistic Information by Contrastive Multimodal Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25270v4)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking, a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance synergistic information through an Infinite Masking strategy. InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Achieving Fine-grained Cross-modal Understanding through Brain-inspired Hierarchical Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01339v1)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding neural responses to visual stimuli remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of brain representations and the modality gap between neural data and visual inputs. Existing methods, mainly based on reducing neural decoding to generation tasks or simple correlations, fail to reflect the hierarchical and temporal processes of visual processing in the brain. To address these limitations, we present NeuroAlign, a novel framework for fine-grained fMRI-video alignment inspired by the hierarchical organization of the human visual system. Our framework implements a two-stage mechanism that mirrors biological visual pathways: global semantic understanding through Neural-Temporal Contrastive Learning (NTCL) and fine-grained pattern matching through enhanced vector quantization. NTCL explicitly models temporal dynamics through bidirectional prediction between modalities, while our DynaSyncMM-EMA approach enables dynamic multi-modal fusion with adaptive weighting. Experiments demonstrate that NeuroAlign significantly outperforms existing methods in cross-modal retrieval tasks, establishing a new paradigm for understanding visual cognitive mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerated Full Waveform Inversion by Deep Compressed Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01268v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose and test a method to reduce the dimensionality of Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) inputs as computational cost mitigation approach. Given modern seismic acquisition systems, the data (as input for FWI) required for an industrial-strength case is in the teraflop level of storage, therefore solving complex subsurface cases or exploring multiple scenarios with FWI become prohibitive. The proposed method utilizes a deep neural network with a binarized sensing layer that learns by compressed learning a succinct but consequential seismic acquisition layout from a large corpus of subsurface models. Thus, given a large seismic data set to invert, the trained network selects a smaller subset of the data, then by using representation learning, an autoencoder computes latent representations of the data, followed by K-means clustering of the latent representations to further select the most relevant data for FWI. Effectively, this approach can be seen as a hierarchical selection. The proposed approach consistently outperforms random data sampling, even when utilizing only 10% of the data for 2D FWI, these results pave the way to accelerating FWI in large scale 3D inversion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Repetition-Invariant Representations for Polymer Informatics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10726v3)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polymers are large macromolecules composed of repeating structural units known as monomers and are widely applied in fields such as energy storage, construction, medicine, and aerospace. However, existing graph neural network methods, though effective for small molecules, only model the single unit of polymers and fail to produce consistent vector representations for the true polymer structure with varying numbers of units. To address this challenge, we introduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer representations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their graph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree alignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and data perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal augmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning. GRIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both homopolymer and copolymer benchmarks, learning stable, repetition-invariant representations that generalize effectively to polymer chains of unseen sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We propose a framework for estimating the conceptual novelty of research papers by combining semantic representation learning with retrieval-based comparison against prior literature. We model novelty as both a binary classification task (novel vs. non-novel) and a pairwise ranking task (comparative novelty), enabling absolute and relative assessments. Experiments benchmark three model scales, ranging from compact domain-specific encoders to a zero-shot frontier model. Results show that fine-tuned lightweight models outperform larger zero-shot models despite their smaller parameter count, indicating that task-specific supervision matters more than scale for conceptual novelty estimation. We further deploy the best-performing model as an online system for public interaction and real-time novelty scoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4, tables, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning As Neural Manifold Packing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13717v2)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive self-supervised learning based on point-wise comparisons has been widely studied for vision tasks. In the visual cortex of the brain, neuronal responses to distinct stimulus classes are organized into geometric structures known as neural manifolds. Accurate classification of stimuli can be achieved by effectively separating these manifolds, akin to solving a packing problem. We introduce Contrastive Learning As Manifold Packing (CLAMP), a self-supervised framework that recasts representation learning as a manifold packing problem. CLAMP introduces a loss function inspired by the potential energy of short-range repulsive particle systems, such as those encountered in the physics of simple liquids and jammed packings. In this framework, each class consists of sub-manifolds embedding multiple augmented views of a single image. The sizes and positions of the sub-manifolds are dynamically optimized by following the gradient of a packing loss. This approach yields interpretable dynamics in the embedding space that parallel jamming physics, and introduces geometrically meaningful hyperparameters within the loss function. Under the standard linear evaluation protocol, which freezes the backbone and trains only a linear classifier, CLAMP achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art self-supervised models. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that neural manifolds corresponding to different categories emerge naturally and are effectively separated in the learned representation space, highlighting the potential of CLAMP to bridge insights from physics, neural science, and machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[KV-Embedding: Training-free Text Embedding via Internal KV Re-routing in Decoder-only LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01046v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While LLMs are powerful embedding backbones, their application in training-free settings faces two structural challenges: causal attention restricts early tokens from accessing subsequent context, and the next-token prediction objective biases representations toward generation rather than semantic compression. To address these limitations, we propose KV-Embedding, a framework that activates the latent representation power of frozen LLMs. Our method leverages the observation that the key-value (KV) states of the final token at each layer encode a compressed view of the sequence. By re-routing these states as a prepended prefix, we enable all tokens to access sequence-level context within a single forward pass. To ensure model-agnostic applicability, we introduce an automated layer selection strategy based on intrinsic dimensionality. Evaluations on MTEB across Qwen, Mistral, and Llama backbones show that KV-Embedding outperforms existing training-free baselines by up to 10%, while maintaining robust performance on sequences up to 4,096 tokens. These results demonstrate that internal state manipulation offers an efficient alternative to input modification, and we hope this work encourages further exploration of LLM internals for representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperJoin: LLM-augmented Hypergraph Link Prediction for Joinable Table Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01015v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a pivotal task in data lake management, joinable table discovery has attracted widespread interest. While existing language model-based methods achieve remarkable performance by combining offline column representation learning with online ranking, their design insufficiently accounts for the underlying structural interactions: (1) offline, they directly model tables into isolated or pairwise columns, thereby struggling to capture the rich inter-table and intra-table structural information; and (2) online, they rank candidate columns based solely on query-candidate similarity, ignoring the mutual interactions among the candidates, leading to incoherent result sets. To address these limitations, we propose HyperJoin, a large language model (LLM)-augmented Hypergraph framework for Joinable table discovery. Specifically, we first construct a hypergraph to model tables using both the intra-table hyperedges and the LLM-augmented inter-table hyperedges. Consequently, the task of joinable table discovery is formulated as link prediction on this constructed hypergraph. We then design HIN, a Hierarchical Interaction Network that learns expressive column representations through bidirectional message passing over columns and hyperedges. To strengthen coherence and internal consistency in the result columns, we cast online ranking as a coherence-aware top-k column selection problem. We then introduce a reranking module that leverages a maximum spanning tree algorithm to prune noisy connections and maximize coherence. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of HyperJoin, achieving average improvements of 21.4% (Precision@15) and 17.2% (Recall@15) over the best baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Interpretability with Identifiable Temporal-Instantaneous Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23323v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling, instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Deep Clustering with Associative Memories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00963v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep clustering - joint representation learning and latent space clustering - is a well studied problem especially in computer vision and text processing under the deep learning framework. While the representation learning is generally differentiable, clustering is an inherently discrete optimization task, requiring various approximations and regularizations to fit in a standard differentiable pipeline. This leads to a somewhat disjointed representation learning and clustering. In this work, we propose a novel loss function utilizing energy-based dynamics via Associative Memories to formulate a new deep clustering method, DCAM, which ties together the representation learning and clustering aspects more intricately in a single objective. Our experiments showcase the advantage of DCAM, producing improved clustering quality for various architecture choices (convolutional, residual or fully-connected) and data modalities (images or text).</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Anchor Transport: Robust Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17002v3)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have shown unprecedented zero-shot performance across a wide range of tasks. Nevertheless, these models may be unreliable under distributional shifts, as their performance is significantly degraded. In this work, we investigate how to efficiently utilize class text information to mitigate distribution drifts encountered by VLMs during inference. In particular, we propose generating pseudo-labels for the noisy test-time samples by aligning visual embeddings with reliable, text-based semantic anchors. Specifically, to maintain the regular structure of the dataset properly, we formulate the problem as a batch-wise label assignment, which is efficiently solved using Optimal Transport. Our method, Semantic Anchor Transport (SAT), utilizes such pseudo-labels as supervisory signals for test-time adaptation, yielding a principled cross-modal alignment solution. Moreover, SAT further leverages heterogeneous textual clues, with a multi-template distillation approach that replicates multi-view contrastive learning strategies in unsupervised representation learning without incurring additional computational complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple popular test-time adaptation benchmarks presenting diverse complexity empirically show the superiority of SAT, achieving consistent performance gains over recent state-of-the-art methods, yet being computationally efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added additional figures to communicate the algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Frequent subgraph-based persistent homology for graph classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24917v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Persistent homology (PH) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting topological features. Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: A...</summary><p>v2: Author list updated to include previously omitted co-authors</p></details> |
| **[Wave2Word: A Multimodal Transformer Framework for Joint EEG-Text Alignment and Multi-Task Representation Learning in Neurocritical Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00670v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) is routinely used in neurocritical care to monitor seizures and other harmful brain activity, including rhythmic and periodic patterns that are clinically significant. Although deep learning methods have achieved high accuracy in seizure detection, most existing approaches remain seizure-centric, rely on discrete-label supervision, and are primarily evaluated using accuracy-based metrics. A central limitation of current EEG modeling practice is the weak correspondence between learned representations and how EEG findings are interpreted and summarized in clinical workflows. Harmful EEG activity exhibits overlapping patterns, graded expert agreement, and temporal persistence, which are not well captured by classification objectives alone. This work proposes a multimodal EEG representation learning framework that integrates signal-domain modeling with structured clinical language supervision. First, raw EEG is transformed into a longitudinal bipolar montage and time-frequency representations. Second, dual transformer-based encoders model complementary temporal and frequency-centric dependencies and are fused using an adaptive gating mechanism. Third, EEG embeddings are aligned with structured expert consensus descriptions through a contrastive objective. Finally, an EEG-conditioned text reconstruction loss is introduced as a representation-level constraint alongside standard classification loss. Experimental evaluation using a controlled train-validation-test split achieves a six-class test accuracy of 0.9797. Ablation analyses show that removing contrastive alignment reduces cross-modal retrieval performance from Recall@10 of 0.3390 to 0.0045, despite minimal change in classification accuracy. These findings demonstrate that discriminative accuracy does not reliably reflect representation quality for clinically meaningful EEG modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Representation Learning for 3D Mesh Parameterization with Semantic and Visibility Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25094v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent 3D generative models produce high-quality textures for 3D mesh objects. However, they commonly rely on the heavy assumption that input 3D meshes are accompanied by manual mesh parameterization (UV mapping), a manual task that requires both technical precision and artistic judgment. Industry surveys show that this process often accounts for a significant share of asset creation, creating a major bottleneck for 3D content creators. Moreover, existing automatic methods often ignore two perceptually important criteria: (1) semantic awareness (UV charts should align semantically similar 3D parts across shapes) and (2) visibility awareness (cutting seams should lie in regions unlikely to be seen). To overcome these shortcomings and to automate the mesh parameterization process, we present an unsupervised differentiable framework that augments standard geometry-preserving UV learning with semantic- and visibility-aware objectives. For semantic-awareness, our pipeline (i) segments the mesh into semantic 3D parts, (ii) applies an unsupervised learned per-part UV-parameterization backbone, and (iii) aggregates per-part charts into a unified UV atlas. For visibility-awareness, we use ambient occlusion (AO) as an exposure proxy and back-propagate a soft differentiable AO-weighted seam objective to steer cutting seams toward occluded regions. By conducting qualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we show that the proposed method produces UV atlases that better support texture generation and reduce perceptible seam artifacts compared to recent baselines. Our implementation code is publicly available at: https://github.com/AHHHZ975/Semantic-Visibility-UV-Param.</p></details> |  |

This work bridges the gap between advanced representation learning and practical network protection by introducing Traffic-MoE, a sparse foundation model optimized for high-efficiency real-time inference. By dynamically routing traffic tokens to a small subset of specialized experts, Traffic-MoE effectively decouples model capacity from computational overhead. Extensive evaluations across three security-oriented tasks demonstrate that Traffic-MoE achieves up to a 12.38% improvement in detection performance compared to leading dense competitors. Crucially, it delivers a 91.62% increase in throughput, reduces inference latency by 47.81%, and cuts peak GPU memory consumption by 38.72%. Beyond efficiency, Traffic-MoE exhibits superior robustness against adversarial traffic shaping and maintains high detection efficacy in few-shot scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for scalable and resilient network traffic analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Syn-to-Real IQA: A Novel Perspective on Reshaping Synthetic Data Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00225v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) has advanced significantly through deep learning, but the scarcity of large-scale labeled datasets remains a challenge. While synthetic data offers a promising solution, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often show limited generalization ability. In this work, we make a key observation that representations learned from synthetic datasets often exhibit a discrete and clustered pattern that hinders regression performance: features of high-quality images cluster around reference images, while those of low-quality images cluster based on distortion types. Our analysis reveals that this issue stems from the distribution of synthetic data rather than model architecture. Consequently, we introduce a novel framework SynDR-IQA, which reshapes synthetic data distribution to enhance BIQA generalization. Based on theoretical derivations of sample diversity and redundancy's impact on generalization error, SynDR-IQA employs two strategies: distribution-aware diverse content upsampling, which enhances visual diversity while preserving content distribution, and density-aware redundant cluster downsampling, which balances samples by reducing the density of densely clustered areas. Extensive experiments across three cross-dataset settings (synthetic-to-authentic, synthetic-to-algorithmic, and synthetic-to-synthetic) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

While rotating LiDAR sensors are widely adopted for their robustness and fidelity, current detectors face a trade-off: streaming methods process partial polar sectors on the fly for fast updates but suffer from limited visibility, cross-sector dependencies, and distortions from retrofitted Cartesian designs, whereas full-scan methods achieve higher accuracy but are bottlenecked by the inherent latency of a LiDAR revolution. We propose Polar-Fast-Cartesian-Full (PFCF), a hybrid detector that combines fast polar processing for intra-sector feature extraction with accurate Cartesian reasoning for full-scene understanding. Central to PFCF is a custom Mamba SSM-based streaming backbone with dimensionally-decomposed convolutions that avoids distortion-heavy planes, enabling parameter-efficient, translation-invariant, and distortion-robust polar representation learning. Local sector features are extracted via this backbone, then accumulated into a sector feature buffer to enable efficient inter-sector communication through a full-scan backbone. PFCF establishes a new Pareto frontier on the Waymo Open dataset, surpassing prior streaming baselines by 10% mAP and matching full-scan accuracy at twice the update rate.

| **[Visual Language Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23335v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study visual representation learning from a structural and topological perspective. We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient X/G is not a submanifold of X and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non homeomorphic, discriminative target for example, supervision via labels, cross-instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand and snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis under unseen working conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24679v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

However, most existing approaches assume homogeneous client models and largely overlook the challenge of model-centric heterogeneous FGL (MHtFGL), which frequently arises in practice when organizations employ graph neural networks (GNNs) of different scales and architectures.Such architectural diversity not only undermines smooth server-side aggregation, which presupposes a unified representation space shared across clients' updates, but also further complicates the transfer and integration of structural knowledge across clients. To address this issue, we propose the Federated Graph Knowledge Collaboration (FedGKC) framework. FedGKC introduces a lightweight Copilot Model on each client to facilitate knowledge exchange while local architectures are heterogeneous across clients, and employs two complementary mechanisms: Client-side Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation, which transfers effective knowledge between local and copilot models through bidirectional distillation with multi-view perturbation; and Server-side Knowledge-Aware Model Aggregation, which dynamically assigns aggregation weights based on knowledge provided by clients. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedGKC achieves an average accuracy gain of 3.88% over baselines in MHtFGL scenarios, while maintaining excellent performance in homogeneous settings.</p></details> |  |

However, existing tactile sensors lack standardization, leading to redundant features that hinder cross-sensor generalization. Moreover, existing methods fail to fully integrate the intermediate communication among tactile, language, and vision modalities. To address this, we propose TLV-CoRe, a CLIP-based Tactile-Language-Vision Collaborative Representation learning method. TLV-CoRe introduces a Sensor-Aware Modulator to unify tactile features across different sensors and employs tactile-irrelevant decoupled learning to disentangle irrelevant tactile features. Additionally, a Unified Bridging Adapter is introduced to enhance tri-modal interaction within the shared representation space. To fairly evaluate the effectiveness of tactile models, we further propose the RSS evaluation framework, focusing on Robustness, Synergy, and Stability across different methods. Experimental results demonstrate that TLV-CoRe significantly improves sensor-agnostic representation learning and cross-modal alignment, offering a new direction for multimodal tactile representation.</p></details> |  |

Existing SOP methods typically aggregate contextual features to assist the occupancy representation learning, alleviating issues like occlusion or ambiguity. However, these solutions often face misalignment issues wherein the corresponding features at the same position across different frames may have different semantic meanings during the aggregation process, which leads to unreliable contextual fusion results and an unstable representation learning process. To address this problem, we introduce a new Hierarchical context alignment paradigm for a more accurate SOP (Hi-SOP). Hi-SOP first disentangles the geometric and temporal context for separate alignment, which two branches are then composed to enhance the reliability of SOP. This parsing of the visual input into a local-global alignment hierarchy includes: (I) disentangled geometric and temporal separate alignment, within each leverages depth confidence and camera pose as prior for relevant feature matching respectively; (II) global alignment and composition of the transformed geometric and temporal volumes based on semantics consistency. Our method outperforms SOTAs for semantic scene completion on the SemanticKITTI & NuScenes-Occupancy datasets and LiDAR semantic segmentation on the NuScenes dataset.

| **[Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation for Pre-Trained Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24603v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 tables, 3 figures |

Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced semantic distinctions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[CPR: Causal Physiological Representation Learning for Robust ECG Analysis under Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24564v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis have achieved remarkable accuracy but exhibit fragility against adversarial perturbations, particularly Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP) that mimic biological morphology. Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space. Our findings show that primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, offering a new perspective on how ViTs structure information.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

However, the strong heterogeneity across cell chemistries, form factors, and operating conditions makes it difficult to build a single model that generalizes beyond its training domain. This work proposes a unified capacity forecasting framework that maintains robust performance across diverse chemistries and usage scenarios. We curate 20 public aging datasets into a large-scale corpus covering 1,704 cells and 3,961,195 charge-discharge cycle segments, spanning temperatures from $-5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $45\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, multiple C-rates, and application-oriented profiles such as fast charging and partial cycling. On this corpus, we adopt a Time-Series Foundation Model (TSFM) backbone and apply parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) together with physics-guided contrastive representation learning to capture shared degradation patterns. Experiments on both seen and deliberately held-out unseen datasets show that a single unified model achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with strong per-dataset baselines, while retaining stable performance on chemistries, capacity scales, and operating conditions excluded from training. These results demonstrate the potential of TSFM-based architectures as a scalable and transferable solution for capacity degradation forecasting in real battery management systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to space limitations, the open-source method for supporting materials is currently under discussion</p></details> |
| **[Balanced Hierarchical Contrastive Learning with Decoupled Queries for Fine-grained Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24074v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained remote sensing datasets often use hierarchical label structures to differentiate objects in a coarse-to-fine manner, with each object annotated across multiple levels. However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization. Experiments on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperspherical Graph Representation Learning via Adaptive Neighbor-Mean Alignment and Uniformity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24062v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph representation learning (GRL) aims to encode structural and semantic dependencies of graph-structured data into low-dimensional embeddings. However, existing GRL methods often rely on surrogate contrastive objectives or mutual information maximization, which typically demand complex architectures, negative sampling strategies, and sensitive hyperparameter tuning. These design choices may induce over-smoothing, over-squashing, and training instability. In this work, we propose HyperGRL, a unified framework for hyperspherical graph representation learning via adaptive neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. HyperGRL embeds nodes on a unit hypersphere through two adversarially coupled objectives: neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. The alignment objective uses the mean representation of each node's local neighborhood to construct semantically grounded, stable targets that capture shared structural and feature patterns. The uniformity objective formulates dispersion via an L2-based hyperspherical regularization, encouraging globally uniform embedding distributions while preserving discriminative information. To further stabilize training, we introduce an entropy-guided adaptive balancing mechanism that dynamically regulates the interplay between alignment and uniformity without requiring manual tuning. Extensive experiments on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction demonstrate that HyperGRL delivers superior representation quality and generalization across diverse graph structures, achieving average improvements of 1.49%, 0.86%, and 0.74% over the strongest existing methods, respectively. These findings highlight the effectiveness of geometrically grounded, sampling-free contrastive objectives for graph representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

Representing a video as a set of Gaussians enforces a reasonable inductive bias: that 2-D videos are often consistent projections of a dynamic 3-D scene. We find that tracking emerges when pretraining a network with this architecture. Mapping the trajectory of the learnt Gaussians onto the image plane gives zero-shot tracking performance comparable to state-of-the-art. With small-scale finetuning, our models achieve 34.6% improvement on Kinetics, and 13.1% on Kubric datasets, surpassing existing self-supervised video approaches.

| **[Tracing the Heart's Pathways: ECG Representation Learning from a Cardiac Conduction Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24002v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) stands as a cornerstone of cardiac diagnosis. Recent strides in electrocardiogram self-supervised learning (eSSL) have brightened prospects for enhancing representation learning without relying on high-quality annotations. Yet earlier eSSL methods suffer a key limitation: they focus on consistent patterns across leads and beats, overlooking the inherent differences in heartbeats rooted in cardiac conduction processes, while subtle but significant variations carry unique physiological signatures. Moreover, representation learning for ECG analysis should align with ECG diagnostic guidelines, which progress from individual heartbeats to single leads and ultimately to lead combinations. This sequential logic, however, is often neglected when applying pre-trained models to downstream tasks. To address these gaps, we propose CLEAR-HUG, a two-stage framework designed to capture subtle variations in cardiac conduction across leads while adhering to ECG diagnostic guidelines. In the first stage, we introduce an eSSL model termed Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor (CLEAR), which captures both specific variations and general commonalities across heartbeats. Treating each heartbeat as a distinct entity, CLEAR employs a simple yet effective sparse attention mechanism to reconstruct signals without interference from other heartbeats. In the second stage, we implement a Hierarchical lead-Unified Group head (HUG) for disease diagnosis, mirroring clinical workflow. Experimental results across six tasks show a 6.84% improvement, validating the effectiveness of CLEAR-HUG. This highlights its ability to enhance representations of cardiac conduction and align patterns with expert diagnostic guidelines.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2026 |

However, most models still rely on a static inference paradigm in which whole-slide images are processed once to produce predictions, without reassessment or targeted evidence acquisition under ambiguous diagnoses. This contrasts with clinical diagnostic workflows that refine hypotheses through repeated slide observations and further examination requests. We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology. Among these models, PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle details, such as nuclear features and local invasions.</p></details> |  |

However, recent state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches like Masked Autoencoding (MAE), despite their strong representation learning capabilities, lack temporal awareness. In this paper, we propose STAMP (Stochastic Temporal Autoencoder with Masked Pretraining), a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal information through a stochastic process by conditioning on the time difference between the 2 input volumes. Unlike deterministic Siamese approaches, which compare scans from different time points but fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in disease evolution, STAMP learns temporal dynamics stochastically by reframing the MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective. We evaluated STAMP on two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple visits per patient. STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed both existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on different late stage Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression prediction which require models to learn the underlying non-deterministic temporal dynamics of the diseases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

While previous research has addressed dataset limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings, they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction. Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction. Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Existing image-based approaches face two critical challenges: methods achieving high accuracy typically require dense 3D supervision, while those operating without such supervision struggle to extract accurate geometry from images alone. In this paper, we present GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework that enhances 3D detection through synergistic Gaussian-Voxel representation learning. Our key insight is that continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations capture complementary geometric information: Gaussians excel at modeling fine-grained surface details while voxels provide structured spatial context. We introduce a dual-representation architecture that: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract complementary geometric features for detection tasks, and 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields. Unlike previous methods that either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or utilize Gaussian representations solely for depth regularization, our synergistic strategy directly leverages features from both representations through learnable integration, enabling more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods on both ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes datasets, all without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (e.g., point clouds or TSDF).</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Despite extensive research on representation learning, decentralized approaches remain relatively underexplored. This work develops a decentralized projected gradient descent-based algorithm for multi-task representation learning. We focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression in which multiple linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation. We present an alternating projected gradient descent and minimization algorithm for recovering a low-rank feature matrix in a diffusion-based decentralized and federated fashion. We obtain constructive, provable guarantees that provide a lower bound on the required sample complexity and an upper bound on the iteration complexity of our proposed algorithm. We analyze the time and communication complexity of our algorithm and show that it is fast and communication-efficient. We performed numerical simulations to validate the performance of our algorithm and compared it with benchmark algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation for Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23076v1)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotional states manifest as coordinated yet heterogeneous physiological responses across central and autonomic systems, posing a fundamental challenge for multimodal representation learning in affective computing. Learning such joint dynamics is further complicated by the scarcity and subjectivity of affective annotations, which motivates the use of self-supervised learning (SSL). However, most existing SSL approaches rely on pairwise alignment objectives, which are insufficient to characterize dependencies among more than two modalities and fail to capture higher-order interactions arising from coordinated brain and autonomic responses. To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation (MFMC), a principled SSL framework that maximizes higher-order multimodal dependence through a Dual Total Correlation (DTC) objective. By deriving a tight sandwich bound and optimizing it using a functional maximum correlation analysis (FMCA) based trace surrogate, MFMC captures joint multimodal interactions directly, without relying on pairwise contrastive losses. Experiments on three public affective computing benchmarks demonstrate that MFMC consistently achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance under both subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluation protocols, highlighting its robustness to inter-subject variability. In particular, MFMC improves subject-dependent accuracy on CEAP-360VR from 78.9% to 86.8%, and subject-independent accuracy from 27.5% to 33.1% using the EDA signal alone. Moreover, MFMC remains within 0.8 percentage points of the best-performing method on the most challenging EEG subject-independent split of MAHNOB-HCI.

In this work, we investigate whether 3D representations can be learned from unlabeled videos recorded without any real 3D sensors. We present Laplacian-Aware Multi-level 3D Clustering with Sinkhorn-Knopp (LAM3C), a self-supervised framework that learns from video-generated point clouds from unlabeled videos. We first introduce RoomTours, a video-generated point cloud dataset constructed by collecting room-walkthrough videos from the web (e.g., real-estate tours) and generating 49,219 scenes using an off-the-shelf feed-forward reconstruction model. We also propose a noise-regularized loss that stabilizes representation learning by enforcing local geometric smoothness and ensuring feature stability under noisy point clouds. Remarkably, without using any real 3D scans, LAM3C achieves higher performance than the previous self-supervised methods on indoor semantic and instance segmentation. These results suggest that unlabeled videos represent an abundant source of data for 3D self-supervised learning.</p></details> |  |

Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases.

Their underlying geometric properties align well with intuitive concepts such as linear separability, minimum enclosing balls, and subspace projection; and basic calculus provides a toolbox for learning through gradient-based optimization. But is this the only possible choice? In this paper, we study the suitability of a radically different field as an alternative to $\mathbb{R}$ -- the ultrametric and non-archimedean space of $p$-adic numbers, $\mathbb{Q}_p$. The hierarchical structure of the $p$-adics and their interpretation as infinite strings make them an appealing tool for code theory and hierarchical representation learning. Our exploratory theoretical work establishes the building blocks for classification, regression, and representation learning with the $p$-adics, providing learning models and algorithms. We illustrate how simple Quillian semantic networks can be represented as a compact $p$-adic linear network, a construction which is not possible with the field of reals. We finish by discussing open problems and opportunities for future research enabled by this new framework.</p></details> | 29 pages |

While centralized approaches have been extensively studied, decentralized methods remain largely underexplored. We study decentralized multi-task representation learning in which the features share a low-rank structure. We consider multiple tasks, each with a finite number of data samples, where the observations follow a linear model with task-specific parameters. In the decentralized setting, task data are distributed across multiple nodes, and information exchange between nodes is constrained by a communication network. The goal is to recover the underlying feature matrix whose rank is much smaller than both the parameter dimension and the number of tasks. We propose a new alternating projected gradient and minimization algorithm with provable accuracy guarantees. We provide comprehensive characterizations of the time, communication, and sample complexities. Importantly, the communication complexity is independent of the target accuracy, which significantly reduces communication cost compared to prior methods. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis across different dimensions and network topologies, and demonstrate regimes in which decentralized learning outperforms centralized federated approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, numerous downstream tasks in specialized and data-limited scientific domains continue to pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Cluster Attention Adapter (CLAdapter), which refines and adapts the rich representations learned from large-scale data to various data-limited downstream tasks. Specifically, CLAdapter introduces attention mechanisms and cluster centers to personalize the enhancement of transformed features through distribution correlation and transformation matrices. This enables models fine-tuned with CLAdapter to learn distinct representations tailored to different feature sets, facilitating the models' adaptation from rich pre-trained features to various downstream scenarios effectively. In addition, CLAdapter's unified interface design allows for seamless integration with multiple model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers, in both 2D and 3D contexts. Through extensive experiments on 10 datasets spanning domains such as generic, multimedia, biological, medical, industrial, agricultural, environmental, geographical, materials science, out-of-distribution (OOD), and 3D analysis, CLAdapter achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse data-limited scientific domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in unleashing the potential of foundation vision models via adaptive transfer.

Results: An average Dice similarity coefficient of 90.51% was achieved in internal verification, which substantially outperformed the baselines (nnU-Net: 82.91%; DUNet: 89.17%; TransUNet: 87.91%). In all external verification experiments, the average results were about 3% higher than those of the best baseline, and were also competitive in domain generalization. Conclusions: This study explored the potential of the latent general representations learned by RETFound for OD and OC segmentation in fundus camera images. Our FunduSegmenter outperformed nearly all state-of-the-art baseline methods. The proposed modules are general and can be extended to fine-tuning other foundation models. Translational Relevance: The model shows strong stability and generalization on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, providing stable OD and OC segmentation. This is an essential step for many automated tasks, from setting the accurate retinal coordinate to biomarker discovery.

| **[Multi-Focused Video Group Activities Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00490v3)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH (multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions typically rely on periodic classifier retraining, resulting in high computational overhead and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a scalable framework for adaptive IoT threat detection that eliminates the need for continuous classifier retraining. The proposed approach trains a classifier once on latent-space representations of historical traffic, while an alignment model maps incoming traffic to the learned historical latent space prior to classification, thereby preserving knowledge of previously observed attacks. To capture inter-instance relationships among attack samples, the low-dimensional latent representations are further transformed into a graph-structured format and classified using a graph neural network. Experimental evaluations on real-world heterogeneous IoT traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains robust detection performance under concept drift. These results highlight the framework's potential for practical deployment in dynamic and large-scale IoT environments.</p></details> |  |

Although radiomics-based machine learning methods have shown promise for this task, conventional unimodal and early-fusion approaches are often limited by high feature redundancy and an incomplete modeling of modality-specific information. In this work, we introduce a multi-view latent representation learning framework based on variational autoencoders (VAE) to integrate complementary radiomic features derived from post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd) and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By encoding each modality through an independent probabilistic encoder and performing fusion in a compact latent space, the proposed approach preserves modality-specific structure while enabling effective multimodal integration. The resulting latent embeddings are subsequently used for MGMT promoter methylation classification.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

Existing deepfake detection methods often rely on handcrafted forensic cues and complex architectures, achieving strong performance in intra-domain settings but suffering significant degradation when confronted with unseen forgery patterns. In this paper, we propose GenDF, a simple yet effective framework that transfers a powerful large-scale vision model to the deepfake detection task with a compact and neat network design. GenDF incorporates deepfake-specific representation learning to capture discriminative patterns between real and fake facial images, feature space redistribution to mitigate distribution mismatch, and a classification-invariant feature augmentation strategy to enhance generalization without introducing additional trainable parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenDF achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance in cross-domain and cross-manipulation settings while requiring only 0.28M trainable parameters, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our paper was accepted by the IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> |

This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research. 30 pages, 16 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose PAN, the first human-centric graph representation learning framework for multimodal action recognition, in which token embeddings of RGB patches containing human joints are represented as spatiotemporal graphs. The human-centric graph modeling paradigm suppresses the redundancy in RGB frames and aligns well with skeleton-based methods, thus enabling a more effective and semantically coherent fusion of multimodal features. Since the sampling of token embeddings heavily relies on 2D skeletal data, we further propose attention-based post calibration to reduce the dependency on high-quality skeletal data at a minimal cost interms of model performance. To explore the potential of PAN in integrating with skeleton-based methods, we present two variants: PAN-Ensemble, which employs dual-path graph convolution networks followed by late fusion, and PAN-Unified, which performs unified graph representation learning within a single network. On three widely used multimodal action recognition datasets, both PAN-Ensemble and PAN-Unified achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in their respective settings of multimodal fusion: separate and unified modeling, respectively.</p></details> |  |

MMCTOP couples schema-guided textualization and input-fidelity validation with modality-aware representation learning, in which domain-specific encoders generate aligned embeddings that are fused by a transformer backbone augmented with a drug-disease-conditioned sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE). This design explicitly supports specialization across therapeutic and design subspaces while maintaining scalable computation through top-k routing. MMCTOP achieves consistent improvements in precision, F1, and AUC over unimodal and multimodal baselines on benchmark datasets, and ablations show that schema-guided textualization and selective expert routing contribute materially to performance and stability. We additionally apply temperature scaling to obtain calibrated probabilities, ensuring reliable risk estimation for downstream decision support. Overall, MMCTOP advances multimodal trial modeling by combining controlled narrative normalization, context-conditioned expert fusion, and operational safeguards aimed at auditability and reproducibility in biomedical informatics.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Different from the image domain, skeleton data possesses sparser spatial structures and diverse representation forms, with the absence of background clues and the additional temporal dimension, presenting new challenges for spatial-temporal motion pretext task design. Recently, many endeavors have been made for skeleton-based SSL, achieving remarkable progress. However, a systematic and thorough review is still lacking. In this paper, we conduct, for the first time, a comprehensive survey on self-supervised skeleton-based action representation learning. Following the taxonomy of context-based, generative learning, and contrastive learning approaches, we make a thorough review and benchmark of existing works and shed light on the future possible directions. Remarkably, our investigation demonstrates that most SSL works rely on the single paradigm, learning representations of a single level, and are evaluated on the action recognition task solely, which leaves the generalization power of skeleton SSL models under-explored. To this end, a novel and effective SSL method for skeleton is further proposed, which integrates versatile representation learning objectives of different granularity, substantially boosting the generalization capacity for multiple skeleton downstream tasks. Extensive experiments under three large-scale datasets demonstrate our method achieves superior generalization performance on various downstream tasks, including recognition, retrieval, detection, and few-shot learning.</p></details> | IJCV 2025 |
| **[Clustering with Communication: A Variational Framework for Single Cell Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04891v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed complex cellular heterogeneity, but recent studies emphasize that understanding biological function also requires modeling cell-cell communication (CCC), the signaling interactions mediated by ligand-receptor pairs that coordinate cellular behavior. Tools like CellChat have demonstrated that CCC plays a critical role in processes such as cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and immune response, and that transcriptomic data inherently encodes rich information about intercellular signaling. We propose CCCVAE, a novel variational autoencoder framework that incorporates CCC signals into single-cell representation learning. By leveraging a communication-aware kernel derived from ligand-receptor interactions and a sparse Gaussian process, CCCVAE encodes biologically informed priors into the latent space. Unlike conventional VAEs that treat each cell independently, CCCVAE encourages latent embeddings to reflect both transcriptional similarity and intercellular signaling context. Empirical results across four scRNA-seq datasets show that CCCVAE improves clustering performance, achieving higher evaluation scores than standard VAE baselines. This work demonstrates the value of embedding biological priors into deep generative models for unsupervised single-cell analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fairness-Aware Graph Representation Learning with Limited Demographic Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13540v3)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring fairness in Graph Neural Networks is fundamental to promoting trustworthy and socially responsible machine learning systems. In response, numerous fair graph learning methods have been proposed in recent years. However, most of them assume full access to demographic information, a requirement rarely met in practice due to privacy, legal, or regulatory restrictions. To this end, this paper introduces a novel fair graph learning framework that mitigates bias in graph learning under limited demographic information. Specifically, we propose a mechanism guided by partial demographic data to generate proxies for demographic information and design a strategy that enforces consistent node embeddings across demographic groups. In addition, we develop an adaptive confidence strategy that dynamically adjusts each node's contribution to fairness and utility based on prediction confidence. We further provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our framework, FairGLite, achieves provable upper bounds on group fairness metrics, offering formal guarantees for bias mitigation. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and fair graph learning frameworks, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in both mitigating bias and maintaining model utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[TICON: A Slide-Level Tile Contextualizer for Histopathology Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21331v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interpretation of small tiles in large whole slide images (WSI) often needs a larger image context. We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench). Finally, we pretrain an aggregator on TICON to form a slide-level foundation model, using only 11K WSIs, outperforming SoTA slide-level foundation models pretrained with up to 350K WSIs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks.

Within this pipeline, surgical scene segmentation plays a central role in accurately perceiving operative events. Although recent deep learning models, particularly large-scale foundation models, achieve remarkable segmentation accuracy, their substantial computational demands and power consumption hinder real-time deployment in resource-constrained surgical environments. To address this limitation, we explore the emerging SNN as a promising paradigm for highly efficient surgical intelligence. However, their performance is still constrained by the scarcity of labeled surgical data and the inherently sparse nature of surgical video representations. To this end, we propose \textit{SpikeSurgSeg}, the first spike-driven video Transformer framework tailored for surgical scene segmentation with real-time potential on non-GPU platforms. To address the limited availability of surgical annotations, we introduce a surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining strategy for SNNs that enables robust spatiotemporal representation learning via layer-wise tube masking. Building on this pretrained backbone, we further adopt a lightweight spike-driven segmentation head that produces temporally consistent predictions while preserving the low-latency characteristics of SNNs. Extensive experiments on EndoVis18 and our in-house SurgBleed dataset demonstrate that SpikeSurgSeg achieves mIoU comparable to SOTA ANN-based models while reducing inference latency by at least $8\times$. Notably, it delivers over $20\times$ acceleration relative to most foundation-model baselines, underscoring its potential for time-critical surgical scene segmentation.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\times$ more data-efficient than standard training. These findings highlight a practical, architecture-agnostic path toward biologically inspired, data-efficient representations. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr-adapt.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Community-Enhanced Graph Representation Model for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21166v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for graph representation learning, their performance on link prediction tasks does not always surpass that of traditional heuristic methods such as Common Neighbors and Jaccard Coefficient. This is mainly because existing GNNs tend to focus on learning local node representations, making it difficult to effectively capture structural relationships between node pairs. Furthermore, excessive reliance on local neighborhood information can lead to over-smoothing. Prior studies have shown that introducing global structural encoding can partially alleviate this issue. To address these limitations, we propose a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework that incorporates community structure to jointly model local and global graph topology. Specifically, CELP enhances the graph via community-aware, confidence-guided edge completion and pruning, while integrating multi-scale structural features to achieve more accurate link prediction. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior performance, validating the crucial role of community structure in improving link prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

One key challenge in enhancing graph transformers is strengthening the discriminative power of distinguishing isomorphisms of graphs, which plays a crucial role in boosting their predictive performances. To address this challenge, we introduce 'Topology-Informed Graph Transformer (TIGT)', a novel transformer enhancing both discriminative power in detecting graph isomorphisms and the overall performance of Graph Transformers. TIGT consists of four components: A topological positional embedding layer using non-isomorphic universal covers based on cyclic subgraphs of graphs to ensure unique graph representation: A dual-path message-passing layer to explicitly encode topological characteristics throughout the encoder layers: A global attention mechanism: And a graph information layer to recalibrate channel-wise graph features for better feature representation. TIGT outperforms previous Graph Transformers in classifying synthetic dataset aimed at distinguishing isomorphism classes of graphs. Additionally, mathematical analysis and empirical evaluations highlight our model's competitive edge over state-of-the-art Graph Transformers across various benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Geometry-grounded Representation Learning and Generative Modeling Workshop (GRaM) at ICML 2024</p></details> |

To mitigate such attacks, many approaches model entities and their relationship using provenance graphs to detect the stealthy and persistent characteristics of APTs. However, existing detection methods suffer from the flaws of missing indirect dependencies, noisy complex scenarios, and missing behavioral logical associations, which make it difficult to detect complex scenarios and effectively identify stealthy threats. In this paper, we propose Sentient, an APT detection method that combines pre-training and intent analysis. It employs a graph transformer to learn structural and semantic information from provenance graphs to avoid missing indirect dependencies. We mitigate scenario noise by combining global and local information. Additionally, we design an Intent Analysis Module (IAM) to associate logical relationships between behaviors. Sentient is trained solely on easily obtainable benign data to detect malicious behaviors that deviate from benign behavioral patterns. We evaluated Sentient on three widely-used datasets covering real-world attacks and simulated attacks. Notably, compared to six state-of-the-art methods, Sentient achieved an average reduction of 44% in false positive rate(FPR) for detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Error Mitigation with Attention Graph Transformers for Burgers Equation Solvers on NISQ Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23817v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework augmented with learned error mitigation for solving the viscous Burgers equation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone. We discuss extensions of this approach to higher-dimensional Burgers systems and more general quantum partial differential equation solvers, highlighting learned error mitigation as a promising complement to physics-based noise reduction techniques on NISQ devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[QE-Catalytic: A Graph-Language Multimodal Base Model for Relaxed-Energy Prediction in Catalytic Adsorption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20084v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adsorption energy is a key descriptor of catalytic reactivity. It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa. To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[A hybrid global local computational framework for ship hull structural analysis using homogenized model and graph neural network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20020v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a computational framework for global local structural analysis of ship hull girders that integrates an equivalent single layer (ESL) model with a graph neural network (GNN). A coarse mesh homogenized ESL model efficiently predicts the global displacement field, from which degrees of freedom (DOFs) along stiffened panel boundaries are extracted. A global to local DOF mapping and reconstruction procedure is developed to recover detailed boundary kinematics for local analysis. The reconstructed DOFs, together with panel geometry and loading, serve as inputs to a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT), a subtype of GNN, which rapidly and accurately predicts the detailed stress and displacement fields for any panel within the hull girder. The HGT is trained using high fidelity 3D panel finite element model with reconstructed boundary conditions, enabling it to generalize across varying panel geometries, loadings, and boundary behaviors. Once trained, the framework requires only the global ESL solution in order to generate detailed local responses, making it highly suitable for optimization. Validation on three box beam case studies demonstrates that the global prediction error is governed by the coarse mesh ESL solution, while the HGT maintains high local accuracy and clearly outperforms conventional ESL based stress estimation method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fraud Detection Through Large-Scale Graph Clustering with Heterogeneous Link Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19061v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative fraud, where multiple fraudulent accounts coordinate to exploit online payment systems, poses significant challenges due to the formation of complex network structures. Traditional detection methods that rely solely on high-confidence identity links suffer from limited coverage, while approaches using all available linkages often result in fragmented graphs with reduced clustering effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based fraud detection framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale heterogeneous graph clustering through a principled link transformation approach. Our method distinguishes between \emph{hard links} (high-confidence identity relationships such as phone numbers, credit cards, and national IDs) and \emph{soft links} (behavioral associations including device fingerprints, cookies, and IP addresses). We introduce a graph transformation technique that first identifies connected components via hard links, merges them into super-nodes, and then reconstructs a weighted soft-link graph amenable to efficient embedding and clustering. The transformed graph is processed using LINE (Large-scale Information Network Embedding) for representation learning, followed by HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for density-based cluster discovery. Experiments on a real-world payment platform dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant graph size reduction (from 25 million to 7.7 million nodes), doubles the detection coverage compared to hard-link-only baselines, and maintains high precision across identified fraud clusters. Our framework provides a scalable and practical solution for industrial-scale fraud detection systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Graph Transformers: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09777v2)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph transformers are a recent advancement in machine learning, offering a new class of neural network models for graph-structured data. The synergy between transformers and graph learning demonstrates strong performance and versatility across various graph-related tasks. This survey provides an in-depth review of recent progress and challenges in graph transformer research. We begin with foundational concepts of graphs and transformers. We then explore design perspectives of graph transformers, focusing on how they integrate graph inductive biases and graph attention mechanisms into the transformer architecture. Furthermore, we propose a taxonomy classifying graph transformers based on depth, scalability, and pre-training strategies, summarizing key principles for effective development of graph transformer models. Beyond technical analysis, we discuss the applications of graph transformer models for node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks, exploring their potential in other application scenarios as well. Finally, we identify remaining challenges in the field, such as scalability and efficiency, generalization and robustness, interpretability and explainability, dynamic and complex graphs, as well as data quality and diversity, charting future directions for graph transformer research.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |
| **[HEIGHT: Heterogeneous Interaction Graph Transformer for Robot Navigation in Crowded and Constrained Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12150v3)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of robot navigation in dense and interactive crowds with static constraints such as corridors and furniture. Previous methods fail to consider all types of spatial and temporal interactions among agents and obstacles, leading to unsafe and inefficient robot paths. In this article, we leverage a graph-based representation of crowded and constrained scenarios and propose a structured framework to learn robot navigation policies with deep reinforcement learning. We first split the representations of different inputs and propose a heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph to model distinct interactions among humans, robots, and obstacles. Based on the heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph, we propose HEIGHT, a novel navigation policy network architecture with different components to capture heterogeneous interactions through space and time. HEIGHT utilizes attention mechanisms to prioritize important interactions and a recurrent network to track changes in the dynamic scene over time, encouraging the robot to avoid collisions adaptively. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that HEIGHT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of success, navigation time, and generalization to domain shifts in challenging navigation scenarios.

| **[TAG-HGT: A Scalable and Cost-Effective Framework for Inductive Cold-Start Academic Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02381v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive cold-start recommendation remains the "Achilles' Heel" of industrial academic platforms, where thousands of new scholars join daily without historical interaction records. While recent Generative Graph Models (e.g., HiGPT, OFA) demonstrate promising semantic capabilities, their prohibitive inference latency (often exceeding 13 minutes per 1,000 requests) and massive computational costs render them practically undeployable for real-time, million-scale applications. To bridge this gap between generative quality and industrial scalability, we propose TAG-HGT, a cost-effective neuro-symbolic framework. Adopting a decoupled "Semantics-First, Structure-Refined" paradigm, TAG-HGT utilizes a frozen Large Language Model (DeepSeek-V3) as an offline semantic factory and distills its knowledge into a lightweight Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via Cross-View Contrastive Learning (CVCL). We present a key insight: while LLM semantics provide necessary global recall, structural signals offer the critical local discrimination needed to distinguish valid collaborators from semantically similar but socially unreachable strangers in dense embedding spaces. Validated under a strict Time-Machine Protocol on the massive OpenAlex dataset, TAG-HGT achieves a SOTA System Recall@10 of 91.97%, outperforming structure-only baselines by 20.7%. Most significantly, from an industrial perspective, TAG-HGT reduces inference latency by five orders of magnitude ($4.5 \times 10^{5}\times$) compared to generative baselines (from 780s down to 1.73 ms), and slashes inference costs from $\sim$$1.50 to $<$$0.001 per 1k queries. This 99.9% cost reduction democratizes high-precision academic recommendation.</p></details> | 8pages |
| **[Scaling Text2SQL via LLM-efficient Schema Filtering with Functional Dependency Graph Rerankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16083v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most modern Text2SQL systems prompt large language models (LLMs) with entire schemas -- mostly column information -- alongside the user's question. While effective on small databases, this approach fails on real-world schemas that exceed LLM context limits, even for commercial models. The recent Spider 2.0 benchmark exemplifies this with hundreds of tables and tens of thousands of columns, where existing systems often break. Current mitigations either rely on costly multi-step prompting pipelines or filter columns by ranking them against user's question independently, ignoring inter-column structure. To scale existing systems, we introduce \toolname, an open-source, LLM-efficient schema filtering framework that compacts Text2SQL prompts by (i) ranking columns with a query-aware LLM encoder enriched with values and metadata, (ii) reranking inter-connected columns via a lightweight graph transformer over functional dependencies, and (iii) selecting a connectivity-preserving sub-schema with a Steiner-tree heuristic. Experiments on real datasets show that \toolname achieves near-perfect recall and higher precision than CodeS, SchemaExP, Qwen rerankers, and embedding retrievers, while maintaining sub-second median latency and scaling to schemas with 23,000+ columns.

However, benchmarking practices remain fragmented, often relying on narrow, task-specific datasets and inconsistent evaluation protocols, which hampers reproducibility and broader progress. To address this, we introduce GraphBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that spans diverse domains and prediction tasks, including node-level, edge-level, graph-level, and generative settings. GraphBench provides standardized evaluation protocols -- with consistent dataset splits and performance metrics that account for out-of-distribution generalization -- as well as a unified hyperparameter tuning framework. Additionally, we benchmark GraphBench using message-passing neural networks and graph transformer models, providing principled baselines and establishing a reference performance.

| **[ParaFormer: A Generalized PageRank Graph Transformer for Graph Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14619v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a promising graph learning tool, leveraging their all-pair connected property to effectively capture global information. To address the over-smoothing problem in deep GNNs, global attention was initially introduced, eliminating the necessity for using deep GNNs. However, through empirical and theoretical analysis, we verify that the introduced global attention exhibits severe over-smoothing, causing node representations to become indistinguishable due to its inherent low-pass filtering. This effect is even stronger than that observed in GNNs. To mitigate this, we propose PageRank Transformer (ParaFormer), which features a PageRank-enhanced attention module designed to mimic the behavior of deep Transformers. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that ParaFormer mitigates over-smoothing by functioning as an adaptive-pass filter. Experiments show that ParaFormer achieves consistent performance improvements across both node classification and graph classification tasks on 11 datasets ranging from thousands to millions of nodes, validating its efficacy. The supplementary material, including code and appendix, can be found in https://github.com/chaohaoyuan/ParaFormer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WSDM 2026</p></details> |

However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Complete Guide to Spherical Equivariant Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13927v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spherical equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) provide a principled framework for learning on three-dimensional molecular and biomolecular systems, where predictions must respect the rotational symmetries inherent in physics. These models extend traditional message-passing GNNs and Transformers by representing node and edge features as spherical tensors that transform under irreducible representations of the rotation group SO(3), ensuring that predictions change in physically meaningful ways under rotations of the input. This guide develops a complete, intuitive foundation for spherical equivariant modeling - from group representations and spherical harmonics, to tensor products, Clebsch-Gordan decomposition, and the construction of SO(3)-equivariant kernels. Building on this foundation, we construct the Tensor Field Network and SE(3)-Transformer architectures and explain how they perform equivariant message-passing and attention on geometric graphs. Through clear mathematical derivations and annotated code excerpts, this guide serves as a self-contained introduction for researchers and learners seeking to understand or implement spherical EGNNs for applications in chemistry, molecular property prediction, protein structure modeling, and generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a technical version of the article originally published in Alchemy Bio (99 pages, 46 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Taint Analysis for Graph APIs Focusing on Broken Access Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08947v4)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis for Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes of the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether a tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use Critical Pair Analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the Critical Pair Analysis is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final preprint (revision #3) for submission to ICGT 24 Special Issue in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Node-Level Graph Domain Adaptation by Alleviating Local Dependency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13149v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in machine learning methods on graphs. However, transferring knowledge effectively from one graph to another remains a critical challenge. This highlights the need for algorithms capable of applying information extracted from a source graph to an unlabeled target graph, a task known as unsupervised graph domain adaptation (GDA). One key difficulty in unsupervised GDA is conditional shift, which hinders transferability. In this paper, we show that conditional shift can be observed only if there exists local dependencies among node features. To support this claim, we perform a rigorous analysis and also further provide generalization bounds of GDA when dependent node features are modeled using markov chains. Guided by the theoretical findings, we propose to improve GDA by decorrelating node features, which can be specifically implemented through decorrelated GCN layers and graph transformer layers. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing not only substantial performance enhancements over baseline GDA methods but also clear visualizations of small intra-class distances in the learned representations.

| **[Towards Practical Large-scale Dynamical Heterogeneous Graph Embedding: Cold-start Resilient Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13120v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying dynamic heterogeneous graph embeddings in production faces key challenges of scalability, data freshness, and cold-start. This paper introduces a practical, two-stage solution that balances deep graph representation with low-latency incremental updates. Our framework combines HetSGFormer, a scalable graph transformer for static learning, with Incremental Locally Linear Embedding (ILLE), a lightweight, CPU-based algorithm for real-time updates. HetSGFormer captures global structure with linear scalability, while ILLE provides rapid, targeted updates to incorporate new data, thus avoiding costly full retraining. This dual approach is cold-start resilient, leveraging the graph to create meaningful embeddings from sparse data. On billion-scale graphs, A/B tests show HetSGFormer achieved up to a 6.11% lift in Advertiser Value over previous methods, while the ILLE module added another 3.22% lift and improved embedding refresh timeliness by 83.2%. Our work provides a validated framework for deploying dynamic graph learning in production environments.</p></details> |  |

Using CEEMDAN, we extract nine IMFs spanning high-frequency fluctuations to long-term trends. Each IMF is transformed into a graph using four time-series-to-graph methods: natural visibility, horizontal visibility, recurrence, and transition graphs. Topological analysis shows clear scale-dependent structure: high-frequency IMFs yield dense, highly connected small-world graphs, whereas low-frequency IMFs produce sparser networks with longer characteristic path lengths. Visibility-based methods are more sensitive to amplitude variability and typically generate higher clustering, while recurrence graphs better preserve temporal dependencies. These results provide guidance for designing GNN architectures tailored to the structural properties of decomposed components, supporting more effective predictive modeling of financial time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We present PROTON, a heterogeneous graph transformer that generates testable hypotheses across molecular, organoid, and clinical systems. To evaluate PROTON, we apply it to Parkinson's disease (PD), bipolar disorder (BD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In PD, PROTON linked genetic risk loci to genes essential for dopaminergic neuron survival and predicted pesticides toxic to patient-derived neurons, including the insecticide endosulfan, which ranked within the top 1.29% of predictions. In silico screens performed by PROTON reproduced six genome-wide $α$-synuclein experiments, including a split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system (normalized enrichment score [NES] = 2.30, FDR-adjusted $p < 1 \times 10^{-4}$), an ascorbate peroxidase proximity labeling assay (NES = 2.16, FDR $< 1 \times 10^{-4}$), and a high-depth targeted exome sequencing study in 496 synucleinopathy patients (NES = 2.13, FDR $< 1 \times 10^{-4}$). In BD, PROTON predicted calcitriol as a candidate drug that reversed proteomic alterations observed in cortical organoids derived from BD patients. In AD, we evaluated PROTON predictions in health records from $n = 610,524$ patients at Mass General Brigham, confirming that five PROTON-predicted drugs were associated with reduced seven-year dementia risk (minimum hazard ratio = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.53-0.75, $p < 1 \times 10^{-7}$). PROTON generated neurological hypotheses that were evaluated across molecular, organoid, and clinical systems, defining a path for AI-driven discovery in neurological disease.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEIST: A Graph Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics and Proteomics Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11152v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics have become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and gene expression at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.</p></details> |  |

However, the design of scalable and topology-aware node tokenization has lagged behind other modalities. This gap becomes critical as the quadratic complexity of full attention renders them impractical on large-scale graphs. Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as brain-inspired models, provided an energy-saving scheme to convert input intensity into discrete spike-based representations through event-driven spiking neurons. Inspired by these characteristics, we propose a linear-time Graph Transformer with Spiking Node Tokenization (GT-SNT) for node classification. By integrating multi-step feature propagation with SNNs, spiking node tokenization generates compact, locality-aware spike count embeddings as node tokens to avoid predefined codebooks and their utilization issues. The codebook guided self-attention leverages these tokens to perform node-to-token attention for linear-time global context aggregation. In experiments, we compare GT-SNT with other state-of-the-art baselines on node classification datasets ranging from small to large. Experimental results show that GT-SNT achieves comparable performances on most datasets and reaches up to 130x faster inference speed compared to other GTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026; Code is available at https://github.com/Zhhuizhe/GT-SNT</p></details> |
| **[An Efficient Graph-Transformer Operator for Learning Physical Dynamics with Manifolds Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10227v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient physical simulations are essential in science and engineering, yet traditional numerical solvers face significant challenges in computational cost when handling simulations across dynamic scenarios involving complex geometries, varying boundary/initial conditions, and diverse physical parameters. While deep learning offers promising alternatives, existing methods often struggle with flexibility and generalization, particularly on unstructured meshes, which significantly limits their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose PhysGTO, an efficient Graph-Transformer Operator for learning physical dynamics through explicit manifold embeddings in both physical and latent spaces. In the physical space, the proposed Unified Graph Embedding module aligns node-level conditions and constructs sparse yet structure-preserving graph connectivity to process heterogeneous inputs. In the latent space, PhysGTO integrates a lightweight flux-oriented message-passing scheme with projection-inspired attention to capture local and global dependencies, facilitating multilevel interactions among complex physical correlations. This design ensures linear complexity relative to the number of mesh points, reducing both the number of trainable parameters and computational costs in terms of floating-point operations (FLOPs), and thereby allowing efficient inference in real-time applications. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning eleven datasets, covering problems with unstructured meshes, transient flow dynamics, and large-scale 3D geometries. PhysGTO consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs, demonstrating superior flexibility, scalability, and generalization in a wide range of simulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/pengwei07/PhysGTO</p></details> |
| **[Rule-Based Graph Programs Matching the Time Complexity of Imperative Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09144v3)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on recent advances in rule-based graph programming, which allow us to match the time complexity of some fundamental imperative graph algorithms. In general, achieving the time complexity of graph algorithms implemented in conventional languages using a rule-based graph-transformation language is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be implemented in the graph programming language GP 2 such that their runtime matches the time complexity of imperative implementations. However, this required input graphs to have a bounded node degree and (for some algorithms) to be connected. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies: the first program checks whether input graphs are connected, the second program checks whether input graphs are acyclic, and the third program solves the single-source shortest-paths problem for graphs with integer edge-weights. The first two programs run in linear time on (possibly disconnected) input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. The third program runs in time $O(nm)$ on arbitrary input graphs, matching the time complexity of imperative implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. For each program, we formally prove its correctness and time complexity, and provide runtime experiments on various graph classes.</p></details> | LMCS |
| **[A Network Science Approach to Granular Time Series Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17640v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series segmentation (TSS) is one of the time series (TS) analysis techniques, that has received considerably less attention compared to other TS related tasks. In recent years, deep learning architectures have been introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of various TS-to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d) demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the required training data compared to the baseline methods.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Graph Deep Learning for Intracranial Aneurysm Blood Flow Simulation and Risk Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09013v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intracranial aneurysms remain a major cause of neurological morbidity and mortality worldwide, where rupture risk is tightly coupled to local hemodynamics particularly wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index. Conventional computational fluid dynamics simulations provide accurate insights but are prohibitively slow and require specialized expertise. Clinical imaging alternatives such as 4D Flow MRI offer direct in-vivo measurements, yet their spatial resolution remains insufficient to capture the fine-scale shear patterns that drive endothelial remodeling and rupture risk while being extremely impractical and expensive. We present a graph neural network surrogate model that bridges this gap by reproducing full-field hemodynamics directly from vascular geometries in less than one minute per cardiac cycle. Trained on a comprehensive dataset of high-fidelity simulations of patient-specific aneurysms, our architecture combines graph transformers with autoregressive predictions to accurately simulate blood flow, wall shear stress, and oscillatory shear index. The model generalizes across unseen patient geometries and inflow conditions without mesh-specific calibration. Beyond accelerating simulation, our framework establishes the foundation for clinically interpretable hemodynamic prediction. By enabling near real-time inference integrated with existing imaging pipelines, it allows direct comparison with hospital phase-diagram assessments and extends them with physically grounded, high-resolution flow fields. This work transforms high-fidelity simulations from an expert-only research tool into a deployable, data-driven decision support system. Our full pipeline delivers high-resolution hemodynamic predictions within minutes of patient imaging, without requiring computational specialists, marking a step-change toward real-time, bedside aneurysm analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards agent-based-model informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05764v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we present a framework for designing neural networks that remain consistent with the underlying principles of agent-based models. We begin by highlighting the limitations of standard neural differential equations in modeling complex systems, where physical invariants (like energy) are often absent but other constraints (like mass conservation, information locality, bounded rationality) must be enforced. To address this, we introduce Agent-Based-Model informed Neural Networks (ABM-NNs), which leverage restricted graph neural networks and hierarchical decomposition to learn interpretable, structure-preserving dynamics. We validate the framework across three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a generalized Generalized Lotka--Volterra system, where we recover ground-truth parameters from short trajectories in presence of interventions; (ii) a graph-based SIR contagion model, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning baselines (GCN, GraphSAGE, Graph Transformer) in out-of-sample forecasting and noise robustness; and (iii) a real-world macroeconomic model of the ten largest economies, where we learn coupled GDP dynamics from empirical data and demonstrate counterfactual analysis for policy interventions</p></details> |  |
| **[Using weakest application conditions to rank graph transformations for graph repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08788v5)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When using graphs and graph transformations to model systems, consistency is an important concern. While consistency has primarily been viewed as a binary property, i.e., a graph is consistent or inconsistent with respect to a set of constraints, recent work has presented an approach to consistency as a graduated property. This allows living with inconsistencies for a while and repairing them when necessary. For repairing inconsistencies in a graph, we use graph transformation rules with so-called {\em impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions} to understand how much repair gain certain rule applications would bring. Both types of conditions can be derived from given graph constraints. Our main theorem shows that the difference between the number of actual constraint violations before and after a graph transformation step can be characterised by the difference between the numbers of violated impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions. This theory forms the basis for algorithms with look-ahead that rank graph transformations according to their potential for graph repair. An evaluation shows that graph repair can be well-supported by rules with these new types of application conditions in terms of effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 25 Figures, new, more efficient method for constructing application conditions, theoretical comparison to other concepts of consistency, extended evaluation</p></details> |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning on Molecular Graphs: A Systematic Investigation of Masking Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07064v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) plays a central role in molecular representation learning. Yet, many recent innovations in masking-based pretraining are introduced as heuristics and lack principled evaluation, obscuring which design choices are genuinely effective. This work cast the entire pretrain-finetune workflow into a unified probabilistic framework, enabling a transparent comparison and deeper understanding of masking strategies. Building on this formalism, we conduct a controlled study of three core design dimensions: masking distribution, prediction target, and encoder architecture, under rigorously controlled settings. We further employ information-theoretic measures to assess the informativeness of pretraining signals and connect them to empirically benchmarked downstream performance. Our findings reveal a surprising insight: sophisticated masking distributions offer no consistent benefit over uniform sampling for common node-level prediction tasks. Instead, the choice of prediction target and its synergy with the encoder architecture are far more critical. Specifically, shifting to semantically richer targets yields substantial downstream improvements, particularly when paired with expressive Graph Transformer encoders. These insights offer practical guidance for developing more effective SSL methods for molecular graphs.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional wet lab experiments are limited by efficiency and cost constraints, making it difficult to extensively explore potential associations between developed drugs and target miRNAs. Therefore, we have designed a novel machine learning model based on a multi-layer transformer-based graph neural network, DMAGT, specifically for predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. This model transforms drug-miRNA associations into graphs, employs Word2Vec for embedding features of drug molecular structures and miRNA base structures, and leverages a graph transformer model to learn from embedded features and relational structures, ultimately predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. To evaluate DMAGT, we tested its performance on three datasets composed of drug-miRNA associations: ncDR, RNAInter, and SM2miR, achieving up to AUC of $95.24\pm0.05$. DMAGT demonstrated superior performance in comparative experiments tackling similar challenges. To validate its practical efficacy, we specifically focused on two drugs, namely 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin. Of the 20 potential drug-miRNA associations identified as the most likely, 14 were successfully validated. The above experiments demonstrate that DMAGT has an excellent performance and stability in predicting drug-miRNA associations, providing a new shortcut for miRNA drug development.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

We propose continuous neurocognitive monitoring via smartphone speech analysis integrated with Relational Graph Transformer (RELGT) architectures. Proof-of-concept in phenylketonuria (PKU) shows speech-derived "Proficiency in Verbal Discourse" correlates with blood phenylalanine (p = -0.50, p < 0.005) but not standard cognitive tests (all |r| < 0.35). RELGT could overcome information bottlenecks in heterogeneous medical data (speech, labs, assessments), enabling predictive alerts weeks before decompensation. Key challenges: multi-disease validation, clinical workflow integration, equitable multilingual deployment. Success would transform episodic neurology into continuous personalized monitoring for millions globally.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT): Fast and Accurate Molecular Generation via High-Fidelity Discrete Latents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02667v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The de novo generation of molecules with desirable properties is a critical challenge, where diffusion models are computationally intensive and autoregressive models struggle with error propagation. In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence. With its superior performance, efficiency, and architectural novelty, GVT not only presents a compelling alternative to diffusion models but also establishes a strong new baseline for the field, paving the way for future research in discrete latent-space molecular generation.</p></details> |  |

However, fully utilizing the multi-domain characteristics of EEG signals remains a significant challenge. Traditional single-perspective analyses often fail to capture the complex interplay of temporal, frequency, and spatial dimensions in EEG data. To address this, we introduce a multi-view graph transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations that integrates information across three domains: temporal dynamics from continuous series, frequency features extracted from frequency bands, and inter-channel relationships captured through several spatial encodings. This comprehensive approach allows model to capture the nuanced properties inherent in EEG signals, enhancing its flexibility and representational power. Evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrates that MVGT surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance. The results highlight its ability to extract multi-domain information and effectively model inter-channel relationships, showcasing its potential for EEG-based emotion recognition tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICONIP 2025 (Oral). 16 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Generalized Graph Transformer Variational Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00612v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph link prediction has long been a central problem in graph representation learning in both network analysis and generative modeling. Recent progress in deep learning has introduced increasingly sophisticated architectures for capturing relational dependencies within graph-structured data. In this work, we propose the Generalized Graph Transformer Variational Autoencoder (GGT-VAE). Our model integrates Generalized Graph Transformer Architecture with Variational Autoencoder framework for link prediction. Unlike prior GraphVAE, GCN, or GNN approaches, GGT-VAE leverages transformer style global self-attention mechanism along with laplacian positional encoding to model structural patterns across nodes into a latent space without relying on message passing. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GGT-VAE consistently achieves above-baseline performance in terms of ROC-AUC and Average Precision. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to explore graph structure generation using a generalized graph transformer backbone in a variational framework.</p></details> |  |

To identify and stop cyber threats, efficient data collection methods are necessary. This research presents an innovative method to cloud security by integrating numerous data sources and modalities with multi-modal deep learning autoencoders. The Multi-Modal Deep Learning Ensemble Architecture (MMDLEA), a unique approach for anomaly detection and classification in multi-modal data, is proposed in this study. The proposed design integrates the best features of six deep learning models: Multi-Modal Deep Learning Autoencoder (MMDLA), Anomaly Detection using Adaptive Metric Learning (ADAM), ADADELTA, ADAGRAD, RMSPROP, and Stacked Graph Transformer (SGT). A final prediction is produced by combining the outputs of all the models, each of which is trained using a distinct modality of the data. Based on the test dataset, the recommended MMDLA architecture achieves an accuracy of 98.5% and an F1-score of 0.985, demonstrating its superior performance over each individual model. Of the different models, the ADAM model performs the best, with an accuracy of 96.2% and an F1-score of 0.962. With an F1-score of 0.955 and an accuracy of 95.5%, the ADADELTA model trails closely behind. MMDLA obtains an F1-score of 0.948 and an accuracy of 94.8%. Additionally, the suggested MMDLEA design exhibits enhanced resilience to fluctuating modalities and noisy data, proving its usefulness in practical settings. Future study in this area is made possible by the results, which show the potential of the proposed framework for abnormal identification and categorization in multi-modal data.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Short-Range Oversquashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20406v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are widely used for learning on graphs, but their ability to process long-range information is limited by the phenomenon of oversquashing. This limitation has led some researchers to advocate Graph Transformers as a better alternative, whereas others suggest that it can be mitigated within the MPNN framework, using virtual nodes or other rewiring techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that oversquashing is not limited to long-range tasks, but can also arise in short-range problems. This observation allows us to disentangle two distinct mechanisms underlying oversquashing: (1) the bottleneck phenomenon, which can arise even in low-range settings, and (2) the vanishing gradient phenomenon, which is closely associated with long-range tasks. We further show that the short-range bottleneck effect is not captured by existing explanations for oversquashing, and that adding virtual nodes does not resolve it. In contrast, transformers do succeed in such tasks, positioning them as the more compelling solution to oversquashing, compared to specialized MPNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Learning on Graphs (LoG) 2025.

However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.</p></details> | 14 pages.

We present Agint, an agentic graph compiler, interpreter, and runtime that incrementally and hierarchically converts natural-language instructions into typed, effect-aware code DAGs. Agint introduces explicit type floors (text to data to spec to code) grounded in semantic graph transformations and a hybrid LLM and function-based JIT runtime. This enables dynamic graph refinement, reproducible and optimizable execution, speculative evaluation, and interoperability with existing developer tools. Agint's typed graph bindings improve reliability and allow concurrent composition of concurrent codebases by construction, supporting accelerated development with smaller and faster models, lower latency, efficient context utilization, and higher throughput. Hierarchical compilation allows scalable graph edits, while the graph structure supports reproducibility and efficient parallel generation. Agint provides a composable unix-style toolchain: dagify (DAG compiler), dagent (hybrid JIT runtime), schemagin (schema generator), and datagin (data transformer) for realtime, low-latency code and dataflow creation. Human developers and coding agents refine graphs through the Agint CLI, while non-technical users use Agint Flow GUI for visual editing, conversational refinement, and debugging to promote prototype agentic workflows to production code. This continuous co-creation model allows teams to prototype quickly, refine seamlessly, and deploy reliably, bridging natural language, compiler methods, and developer tooling to enable a new generation of composable, team-centric coding agents at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, NeurIPS 2025: Deep Learning for Code in the Agentic Era</p></details> |

Here, we present \textbf{A}I-\textbf{A}ccelerated \textbf{P}hoto\textbf{S}ensitizer \textbf{I}nnovation (AAPSI), a closed-loop workflow that integrates expert knowledge, scaffold-based molecule generation, and Bayesian optimization to accelerate the design of novel photosensitizers. The scaffold-driven generation in AAPSI ensures structural novelty and synthetic feasibility, while the iterative AI-experiment loop accelerates the discovery of novel photosensitizers. AAPSI leverages a curated database of 102,534 photosensitizer-solvent pairs and generate 6,148 synthetically accessible candidates. These candidates are screened via graph transformers trained to predict singlet oxygen quantum yield ($φ_Δ$) and absorption maxima ($λ_{max}$), following experimental validation. This work generates several novel candidates for photodynamic therapy (PDT), among which the hypocrellin-based candidate HB4Ph exhibits exceptional performance at the Pareto frontier of high quantum yield of singlet oxygen and long absorption maxima among current photosensitizers ($φ_Δ$=0.85, $λ_{max}$=650nm).</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce GRIT-LP, a graph transformer explicitly designed for polar ice-layer thickness estimation from polar radar imagery. Accurately estimating ice layer thickness is critical for understanding snow accumulation, reconstructing past climate patterns and reducing uncertainties in projections of future ice sheet evolution and sea level rise. GRIT-LP combines an inductive geometric graph learning framework with self-attention mechanism, and introduces two major innovations that jointly address challenges in modeling the spatio-temporal patterns of ice layers: a partitioned spatial graph construction strategy that forms overlapping, fully connected local neighborhoods to preserve spatial coherence and suppress noise from irrelevant long-range links, and a long-range skip connection mechanism within the transformer that improves information flow and mitigates oversmoothing in deeper attention layers. We conducted extensive experiments, demonstrating that GRIT-LP outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with a 24.92\% improvement in root mean squared error. These results highlight the effectiveness of graph transformers in modeling spatiotemporal patterns by capturing both localized structural features and long-range dependencies across internal ice layers, and demonstrate their potential to advance data-driven understanding of cryospheric processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[PDDFormer: Pairwise Distance Distribution Graph Transformer for Crystal Material Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12984v5)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crystal structures can be simplified as a periodic point set that repeats across three-dimensional space along an underlying lattice. Traditionally, crystal representation methods characterize the structure using descriptors such as lattice parameters, symmetry, and space groups. However, in reality, atoms in materials always vibrate above absolute zero, causing their positions to fluctuate continuously. This dynamic behavior disrupts the fundamental periodicity of the lattice, making crystal graphs based on static lattice parameters and conventional descriptors discontinuous under slight perturbations. Chemists proposed the pairwise distance distribution (PDD) method to address this problem. However, the completeness of PDD requires defining a large number of neighboring atoms, leading to high computational costs. Additionally, PDD does not account for atomic information, making it challenging to apply it directly to crystal material property prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the atom-Weighted Pairwise Distance Distribution (WPDD) and Unit cell Pairwise Distance Distribution (UPDD) and apply them to the construction of multi-edge crystal graphs. We demonstrate the continuity and general completeness of crystal graphs under slight atomic position perturbations. Moreover, by modeling PDD as global information and integrating it into matrix-based message passing, we significantly reduce computational costs. Comprehensive evaluation results show that WPDDFormer achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across tasks on benchmark datasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS-DFT.</p></details> | 15pages,8 figures |
| **[Mesh-based Super-resolution of Detonation Flows with Multiscale Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12041v3)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Super-resolution flow reconstruction using state-of-the-art data-driven techniques is valuable for a variety of applications, such as subgrid/subfilter closure modeling, accelerating spatiotemporal forecasting, data compression, and serving as an upscaling tool for sparse experimental measurements. In the present work, a first-of-its-kind multiscale graph transformer approach is developed for mesh-based super-resolution (SR-GT) of reacting flows. The novel data-driven modeling paradigm leverages a graph-based flow-field representation compatible with complex geometries and non-uniform/unstructured grids. Further, the transformer backbone captures long-range dependencies between different parts of the low-resolution flow-field, identifies important features, and then generates the super-resolved flow-field that preserves those features at a higher resolution. The performance of SR-GT is demonstrated in the context of spectral-element-discretized meshes for a challenging test problem of 2D detonation propagation within a premixed hydrogen-air mixture exhibiting highly complex multiscale reacting flow behavior. The SR-GT framework utilizes a unique element + neighborhood graph representation for the coarse input, which is then tokenized before being processed by the transformer component to produce the fine output. It is demonstrated that SR-GT provides high super-resolution accuracy for reacting flow-field features and superior performance compared to traditional interpolation-based SR schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient LLM-aware Heterogeneous Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17923v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs are widely present in real-world complex networks, where the diversity of node and relation types leads to complex and rich semantics. Efforts for modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs are restricted by the limitations of predefined semantic dependencies and the scarcity of supervised signals. The advanced pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm leverages graph structure to provide rich self-supervised signals, but introduces semantic gaps between tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential to address the semantic issues of relations and tasks in heterogeneous graphs through their strong reasoning capabilities in textual modality, but their incorporation into heterogeneous graphs is largely limited by computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Efficient LLM-Aware (ELLA) framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the above issues. To capture complex relation semantics, we propose an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer that leverages LLM to encode multi-hop, multi-type relations. To reduce computational complexity, we further employ a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer, which help reduces the complexity of LLM-aware relation reasoning from exponential to linear. To bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we introduce the fine-grained task-aware textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Extensive experiments on four heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed ELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the performance and efficiency. In particular, ELLA scales up to 13b-parameter LLMs and achieves up to a 4x speedup compared with existing LLM-based methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/l-wd/ELLA.</p></details> |  |

Today, ZX-calculus, a computing model for quantum circuit transformation, is attracting attention for its highly abstract graph-based approach. Whereas existing tools such as PyZX and Quantomatic offer domain-specific support for quantum circuit optimization, visualization and theorem-proving, we present a complementary approach using LMNtal, a general-purpose hierarchical graph rewriting language, to establish a diagrammatic transformation and verification platform with model checking. Our methodology shows three advantages: (1) manipulation of ZX-diagrams through native graph transformation rules, enabling direct implementation of basic rules; (2) quantified pattern matching via QLMNtal extensions, greatly simplifying rule specification; and (3) interactive visualization and validation of optimization paths through state space exploration. Through case studies, we demonstrate how our framework helps understand optimization paths and design new algorithms and strategies. This suggests that the declarative language LMNtal and its toolchain could serve as a new platform to investigate quantum circuit transformation from a different perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 27 figures.

| **[BrainHGT: A Hierarchical Graph Transformer for Interpretable Brain Network Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17604v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformer shows remarkable potential in brain network analysis due to its ability to model graph structures and complex node relationships. Most existing methods typically model the brain as a flat network, ignoring its modular structure, and their attention mechanisms treat all brain region connections equally, ignoring distance-related node connection patterns. However, brain information processing is a hierarchical process that involves local and long-range interactions between brain regions, interactions between regions and sub-functional modules, and interactions among functional modules themselves. This hierarchical interaction mechanism enables the brain to efficiently integrate local computations and global information flow, supporting the execution of complex cognitive functions. To address this issue, we propose BrainHGT, a hierarchical Graph Transformer that simulates the brain's natural information processing from local regions to global communities. Specifically, we design a novel long-short range attention encoder that utilizes parallel pathways to handle dense local interactions and sparse long-range connections, thereby effectively alleviating the over-globalizing issue. To further capture the brain's modular architecture, we designe a prior-guided clustering module that utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to group brain regions into functional communities and leverage neuroanatomical prior to guide the clustering process, thereby improving the biological plausibility and interpretability. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method significantly improves performance of disease identification, and can reliably capture the sub-functional modules of the brain, demonstrating its interpretability.</p></details> |  |

First, they typically rely on assumptions leading to decay properties of local agent interactions, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies such as cascading power failures or epidemic outbreaks. Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures. Further, to improve credit assignment during training, STACCA integrates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator that is compatible with state-value critic estimates. We evaluate STACCA on epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks, demonstrating improved performance, network generalization, and scalability. These results highlight the potential of transformer-based MARL architectures to achieve scalable and generalizable control in large-scale networked systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted for review</p></details> |

Efficient Long-Range Message Passing with Fractal Nodes in MPNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13010v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, but often struggle to balance local and global information. While graph Transformers aim to address this by enabling long-range interactions, they often overlook the inherent locality and efficiency of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). We propose a new concept called fractal nodes, inspired by the fractal structure observed in real-world networks. Our approach is based on the intuition that graph partitioning naturally induces fractal structure, where subgraphs often reflect the connectivity patterns of the full graph. Fractal nodes are designed to coexist with the original nodes and adaptively aggregate subgraph-level feature representations, thereby enforcing feature similarity within each subgraph. We show that fractal nodes alleviate the over-squashing problem by providing direct shortcut connections that enable long-range propagation of subgraph-level representations. Experiment results show that our method improves the expressive power of MPNNs and achieves comparable or better performance to graph Transformers while maintaining the computational efficiency of MPNN by improving the long-range dependencies of MPNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026 for Oral Representation.

| **[Hierarchical Frequency-Decomposition Graph Neural Networks for Road Network Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12507v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road networks are critical infrastructures underpinning intelligent transportation systems and their related applications. Effective representation learning of road networks remains challenging due to the complex interplay between spatial structures and frequency characteristics in traffic patterns. Existing graph neural networks for modeling road networks predominantly fall into two paradigms: spatial-based methods that capture local topology but tend to over-smooth representations, and spectral-based methods that analyze global frequency components but often overlook localized variations. This spatial-spectral misalignment limits their modeling capacity for road networks exhibiting both coarse global trends and fine-grained local fluctuations. To bridge this gap, we propose HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical frequency-decomposition graph neural network that unifies spatial and spectral modeling. HiFiNet constructs a multi-level hierarchy of virtual nodes to enable localized frequency analysis, and employs a decomposition-updating-reconstruction framework with a topology-aware graph transformer to separately model and fuse low- and high-frequency signals. Theoretically justified and empirically validated on multiple real-world datasets across four downstream tasks, HiFiNet demonstrates superior performance and generalization ability in capturing effective road network representations.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained dynamic graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn user-item representations over temporal snapshot graphs. However, fine-tuning GNNs on these graphs often results in generalization issues due to temporal discrepancies between pre-training and fine-tuning stages, limiting the model's ability to capture evolving user preferences. To address this, we propose TarDGR, a task-aware retrieval-augmented framework designed to enhance generalization capability by incorporating task-aware model and retrieval-augmentation. Specifically, TarDGR introduces a Task-Aware Evaluation Mechanism to identify semantically relevant historical subgraphs, enabling the construction of task-specific datasets without manual labeling. It also presents a Graph Transformer-based Task-Aware Model that integrates semantic and structural encodings to assess subgraph relevance. During inference, TarDGR retrieves and fuses task-aware subgraphs with the query subgraph, enriching its representation and mitigating temporal generalization issues. Experiments on multiple large-scale dynamic graph datasets demonstrate that TarDGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with extensive empirical evidence underscoring its superior accuracy and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[Understanding and Estimating the Execution Time of Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15631v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the scarcity of quantum computing resources, researchers and developers have very limited access to real quantum computers. Therefore, judicious planning and utilization of quantum computer runtime are essential to ensure smooth execution and completion of projects. Accurate estimation of a quantum circuit's execution time is thus necessary to prevent unexpectedly exceeding the anticipated runtime or the maximum capacity of the quantum computers; it also allows quantum computing platforms to make precisely informed provisioning and prioritization of quantum computing jobs. In this paper, we first study the characteristics of quantum circuits' runtime on simulators and real quantum computers. Then, we introduce an innovative method that employs a graph transformer-based model, utilizing the graph information and global information of quantum circuits to estimate their execution time. We selected a benchmark dataset comprising over 1,510 quantum circuits, initially predicting their execution times on simulators, which yielded promising results with an R-squared value greater than 95%. Subsequently, we applied active learning to select 340 circuit samples with a confidence level of 95% to build and evaluate our approach for the estimation of circuit execution times on quantum computers, achieving an average R-squared value exceeding 90%. Our approach can be integrated into quantum computing platforms to provide an accurate estimation of quantum execution time and be used as a reference for prioritizing quantum execution jobs. In addition, our findings provide insights for quantum program developers to optimize their circuits for reduced execution time.</p></details> |  |
| **[MP-GFormer: A 3D-Geometry-Aware Dynamic Graph Transformer Approach for Machining Process Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11837v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machining process planning (MP) is inherently complex due to structural and geometrical dependencies among part features and machining operations. A key challenge lies in capturing dynamic interdependencies that evolve with distinct part geometries as operations are performed. Machine learning has been applied to address challenges in MP, such as operation selection and machining sequence prediction. Dynamic graph learning (DGL) has been widely used to model dynamic systems, thanks to its ability to integrate spatio-temporal relationships. However, in MP, while existing DGL approaches can capture these dependencies, they fail to incorporate three-dimensional (3D) geometric information of parts and thus lack domain awareness in predicting machining operation sequences. To address this limitation, we propose MP-GFormer, a 3D-geometry-aware dynamic graph transformer that integrates evolving 3D geometric representations into DGL through an attention mechanism to predict machining operation sequences. Our approach leverages StereoLithography surface meshes representing the 3D geometry of a part after each machining operation, with the boundary representation method used for the initial 3D designs. We evaluate MP-GFormer on a synthesized dataset and demonstrate that the method achieves improvements of 24\% and 36\% in accuracy for main and sub-operation predictions, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[NTSFormer: A Self-Teaching Graph Transformer for Multimodal Isolated Cold-Start Node Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04870v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Isolated cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because such nodes have no edges and often have missing modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for isolated cold-start inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However, this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student" prediction based only on self information (i.e., the node's own features), and a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature data into token sequences, which are then processed by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion. Experiments on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior performance for multimodal isolated cold-start node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Solvaformer: an SE(3)-equivariant graph transformer for small molecule solubility prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09774v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of small molecule solubility using material-sparing approaches is critical for accelerating synthesis and process optimization, yet experimental measurement is costly and many learning approaches either depend on quantumderived descriptors or offer limited interpretability. We introduce Solvaformer, a geometry-aware graph transformer that models solutions as multiple molecules with independent SE(3) symmetries. The architecture combines intramolecular SE(3)-equivariant attention with intermolecular scalar attention, enabling cross-molecular communication without imposing spurious relative geometry. We train Solvaformer in a multi-task setting to predict both solubility (log S) and solvation free energy, using an alternating-batch regimen that trains on quantum-mechanical data (CombiSolv-QM) and on experimental measurements (BigSolDB 2.0). Solvaformer attains the strongest overall performance among the learned models and approaches a DFT-assisted gradient-boosting baseline, while outperforming an EquiformerV2 ablation and sequence-based alternatives. In addition, token-level attention produces chemically coherent attributions: case studies recover known intra- vs. inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding patterns that govern solubility differences in positional isomers. Taken together, Solvaformer provides an accurate, scalable, and interpretable approach to solution-phase property prediction by uniting geometric inductive bias with a mixed dataset training strategy on complementary computational and experimental data.</p></details> |  |

Public benchmarks remain significantly smaller and hand-crafted, while releasing truly malicious RTL raises ethical and operational risks. This work presents an automated and scalable methodology for generating HT-like patterns in industry-scale netlists whose purpose is to stress-test detection tools without altering user-visible functionality. The pipeline (i) parses large gate-level designs into connectivity graphs, (ii) explores rare regions using SCOAP testability metrics, and (iii) applies parameterized, function-preserving graph transformations to synthesize trigger-payload pairs that mimic the statistical footprint of stealthy HTs. When evaluated on the benchmarks generated in this work, representative state-of-the-art graph-learning models fail to detect Trojans. The framework closes the evaluation gap between academic circuits and modern SoCs by providing reproducible challenge instances that advance security research without sharing step-by-step attack instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in DATE 2026</p></details> |

Existing expressivity results are often tied to specific design choices and lack comprehensive empirical validation on large-scale data. This leaves a gap between theory and practice, preventing generalizable insights that exceed particular application domains. Here, we propose the Generalized-Distance Transformer (GDT), a GT architecture using standard attention that incorporates many advancements for GTs from recent years, and develop a fine-grained understanding of the GDT's representation power in terms of attention and PEs. Through extensive experiments, we identify design choices that consistently perform well across various applications, tasks, and model scales, demonstrating strong performance in a few-shot transfer setting without fine-tuning. Our evaluation covers over eight million graphs with roughly 270M tokens across diverse domains, including image-based object detection, molecular property prediction, code summarization, and out-of-distribution algorithmic reasoning. We distill our theoretical and practical findings into several generalizable insights about effective GT design, training, and inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 as spotlight</p></details> |

However, this can cause overreliance on surface-level labels and impede cross-type knowledge transfer. We explore integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into HGNNs--a direction underexplored despite MoE's success in homogeneous settings. Crucially, we question the need for type-specific experts. We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics. Our work demonstrates that regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations--a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures; 2 tables; work in progress, feedback welcome</p></details> |
| **[QAGT-MLP: An Attention-Based Graph Transformer for Small and Large-Scale Quantum Error Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03119v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Noisy quantum devices demand error-mitigation techniques to be accurate yet simple and efficient in terms of number of shots and processing time. Many established approaches (e.g., extrapolation and quasi-probability cancellation) impose substantial execution or calibration overheads, while existing learning-based methods have difficulty scaling to large and deep circuits. In this research, we introduce QAGT-MLP: an attention-based graph transformer tailored for small- and large-scale quantum error mitigation (QEM). QAGT-MLP encodes each quantum circuit as a graph whose nodes represent gate instances and whose edges capture qubit connectivity and causal adjacency. A dual-path attention module extracts features around measured qubits at two scales or contexts: 1) graph-wide global structural context; and 2) fine-grained local lightcone context. These learned representations are concatenated with circuit-level descriptor features and the circuit noisy expected values, then they are passed to a lightweight MLP to predict the noise-mitigated values. On large-scale 100-qubit Trotterized 1D Transverse-Field Ising Models -- TFIM circuits -- the proposed QAGT-MLP outperformed state-of-the-art learning baselines in terms of mean error and error variability, demonstrating strong validity and applicability in real-world QEM scenarios under matched shot budgets. By using attention to fuse global structures with local lightcone neighborhoods, QAGT-MLP achieves high mitigation quality without the increasing noise scaling or resource demand required by classical QEM pipelines, while still offering a scalable and practical path to QEM in modern and future quantum workloads.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Particle-System Random Batch Methods Enhance Graph Transformer: Memory Efficiency and Parallel Computing Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06044v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanism is a significant part of Transformer models. It helps extract features from embedded vectors by adding global information and its expressivity has been proved to be powerful. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity restricts its practicability. Although several researches have provided attention mechanism in sparse form, they are lack of theoretical analysis about the expressivity of their mechanism while reducing complexity. In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity. Other than this, it can be implemented in parallel on a new dimension, which contributes to much memory saving. (2) Random Batch Attention mechanism can improve most of the existing models by replacing their attention mechanisms, even many previously improved attention mechanisms. (3) Random Batch Attention mechanism has theoretical explanation in convergence, as it comes from Random Batch Methods on computation mathematics. Experiments on large graphs have proved advantages mentioned above. Also, the theoretical modeling of self-attention mechanism is a new tool for future research on attention-mechanism analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reperio-rPPG: Relational Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Periodicity Learning in Remote Physiological Measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05946v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an emerging contactless physiological sensing technique that leverages subtle color variations in facial videos to estimate vital signs such as heart rate and respiratory rate. This non-invasive method has gained traction across diverse domains, including telemedicine, affective computing, driver fatigue detection, and health monitoring, owing to its scalability and convenience. Despite significant progress in remote physiological signal measurement, a crucial characteristic - the intrinsic periodicity - has often been underexplored or insufficiently modeled in previous approaches, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose Reperio-rPPG, a novel framework that strategically integrates Relational Convolutional Networks with a Graph Transformer to effectively capture the periodic structure inherent in physiological signals. Additionally, recognizing the limited diversity of existing rPPG datasets, we further introduce a tailored CutMix augmentation to enhance the model's generalizability. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used benchmark datasets - PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD - demonstrate that Reperio-rPPG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits remarkable robustness under various motion (e.g., stationary, rotation, talking, walking) and illumination conditions (e.g., nature, low LED, high LED).

While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2) transformer representations refine GNN message passing through attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with 6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling, with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein representations through learnable diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Temporal and Structural Context in Graph Transformers for Relational Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04557v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction. To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.</p></details> |  |

We anticipate that dense, weighted functional connectivity graphs occupy a low-dimensional latent geometry along which both topological and spectral structures display graded variations. Here, we estimated this unified graph representation and enabled generation of dense functional brain graphs through a graph transformer autoencoder with latent diffusion, with spectral geometry providing an inductive bias to guide learning. This geometry-aware latent representation, although unsupervised, meaningfully separated working-memory states and decoded visual stimuli, with performance further enhanced by incorporating neural dynamics. From the diffusion modeled distribution, we were able to sample biologically plausible and structurally grounded synthetic dense graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations</p></details> |

Extending graph pre-trained models to web-scale graphs with billions of nodes in industrial scenarios, while avoiding negative transfer across graphs or tasks, remains a challenge. We aim to develop a general graph pre-trained model with inductive ability that can make predictions for unseen new nodes and even new graphs. In this work, we introduce a scalable transformer-based graph pre-training framework called PGT (Pre-trained Graph Transformer). Based on the masked autoencoder architecture, we design two pre-training tasks: one for reconstructing node features and the other for reconstructing local structures. Unlike the original autoencoder architecture where the pre-trained decoder is discarded, we propose a novel strategy that utilizes the decoder for feature augmentation. Our framework, tested on the publicly available ogbn-papers100M dataset with 111 million nodes and 1.6 billion edges, achieves state-of-the-art performance, showcasing scalability and efficiency. We have deployed our framework on Tencent's online game data, confirming its capability to pre-train on real-world graphs with over 540 million nodes and 12 billion edges and to generalize effectively across diverse static and dynamic downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)</p></details> |

Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, ICRA 2025</p></details> |

The key challenge is predicting user purchasing behavior from the available data. Current recommendation models prioritize extracting multimodal information while neglecting the distinction between redundant and valuable data. They also rely heavily on a single semantic framework (e.g., local or global semantics), resulting in an incomplete or biased representation of user preferences, particularly those less expressed in prior interactions. Furthermore, these approaches fail to capture the complex interactions between users and items, limiting the model's ability to meet diverse users. To address these challenges, we present SRGFormer, a structurally optimized multimodal recommendation model. By modifying the transformer for better integration into our model, we capture the overall behavior patterns of users. Then, we enhance structural information by embedding multimodal information into a hypergraph structure to aid in learning the local structures between users and items. Meanwhile, applying self-supervised tasks to user-item collaborative signals enhances the integration of multimodal information, thereby revealing the representational features inherent to the data's modality. Extensive experiments on three public datasets reveal that SRGFormer surpasses previous benchmark models, achieving an average performance improvement of 4.47 percent on the Sports dataset.

Simple Architectures Meet Excellence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09263v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often criticized for their limited expressiveness, issues like over-smoothing and over-squashing, and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies. Conversely, Graph Transformers (GTs) are regarded as superior due to their employment of global attention mechanisms, which potentially mitigate these challenges. Literature frequently suggests that GTs outperform GNNs in graph-level tasks, especially for graph classification and regression on small molecular graphs. In this study, we explore the untapped potential of GNNs through an enhanced framework, GNN+, which integrates six widely used techniques: edge feature integration, normalization, dropout, residual connections, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding, to effectively tackle graph-level tasks. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of three classic GNNs (GCN, GIN, and GatedGCN) enhanced by the GNN+ framework across 14 well-known graph-level datasets. Our results reveal that, contrary to prevailing beliefs, these classic GNNs consistently match or surpass the performance of GTs, securing top-three rankings across all datasets and achieving first place in eight. Furthermore, they demonstrate greater efficiency, running several times faster than GTs on many datasets. This highlights the potential of simple GNN architectures, challenging the notion that complex mechanisms in GTs are essential for superior graph-level performance.

Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter. Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers need not choose between performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Although Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are widely used for financial fraud detection, graph Transformer models such as Graph-BERT are gaining prominence due to their Transformer-based architecture, which mitigates issues such as over-smoothing. Graph-BERT is designed for static graphs and primarily evaluated on citation networks with undirected edges. However, financial transaction networks are inherently dynamic, with evolving structures and directed edges representing the flow of money. To address these challenges, we introduce DynBERG, a novel architecture that integrates Graph-BERT with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer to capture temporal evolution over multiple time steps. Additionally, we modify the underlying algorithm to support directed edges, making DynBERG well-suited for dynamic financial transaction analysis. We evaluate our model on the Elliptic dataset, which includes Bitcoin transactions, including all transactions during a major cryptocurrency market event, the Dark Market Shutdown. By assessing DynBERG's resilience before and after this event, we analyse its ability to adapt to significant market shifts that impact transaction behaviours. Our model is benchmarked against state-of-the-art dynamic graph classification approaches, such as EvolveGCN and GCN, demonstrating superior performance, outperforming EvolveGCN before the market shutdown and surpassing GCN after the event. Additionally, an ablation study highlights the critical role of incorporating a time-series deep learning component, showcasing the effectiveness of GRU in modelling the temporal dynamics of financial transactions.</p></details> |  |

An NLP-based Framework for Trajectory Analysis using Graph Transformer Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23905v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies group target trajectory intent as the outcome of a cooperative game where the complex-spatio trajectories are modeled using an NLP-based generative model. In our framework, the group intent is specified by the characteristic function of a cooperative game, and allocations for players in the cooperative game are specified by either the core, the Shapley value, or the nucleolus. The resulting allocations induce probability distributions that govern the coordinated spatio-temporal trajectories of the targets that reflect the group's underlying intent. We address two key questions: (1) How can the intent of a group trajectory be optimally formalized as the characteristic function of a cooperative game? (2) How can such intent be inferred from noisy observations of the targets? To answer the first question, we introduce a Fisher-information-based characteristic function of the cooperative game, which yields probability distributions that generate coordinated spatio-temporal patterns. As a generative model for these patterns, we develop an NLP-based generative model built on formal grammar, enabling the creation of realistic multi-target trajectory data. To answer the second question, we train a Graph Transformer Neural Network (GTNN) to infer group trajectory intent-expressed as the characteristic function of the cooperative game-from observational data with high accuracy. The self-attention function of the GTNN depends on the track estimates. Thus, the formulation and algorithms provide a multi-layer approach that spans target tracking (Bayesian signal processing) and the GTNN (for group intent inference).</p></details> |  |

This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based structures effortlessly.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective cross-lingual generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Found...</summary><p>Found some issues and need to correct them</p></details> |

However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Despite their success, MPNNs are limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies between nodes. This has led researchers to adapt MPNNs through rewiring or make use of Graph Transformers, which compromises the computational efficiency that characterized early spatial message-passing architectures, and typically disregards the graph structure. Almost a decade after its original introduction, we revisit ChebNet to shed light on its ability to model distant node interactions. We find that out-of-box, ChebNet already shows competitive advantages relative to classical MPNNs and GTs on long-range benchmarks, while maintaining good scalability properties for high-order polynomials. However, we uncover that this polynomial expansion leads ChebNet to an unstable regime during training. To address this limitation, we cast ChebNet as a stable and non-dissipative dynamical system, which we coin Stable-ChebNet. Our Stable-ChebNet model allows for stable information propagation, and has controllable dynamics which do not require the use of eigendecompositions, positional encodings, or graph rewiring. Across several benchmarks, Stable-ChebNet achieves near state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

While effective, rewiring inherently alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Unifying and Enhancing Graph Transformers via a Hierarchical Mask Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18825v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks. Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information. To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our unified framework and model design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 (Poster)</p></details> |
| **[Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12694v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural architecture designed for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages with 3 figures and 2 tables, submitted to IEEE for a possible publication</p></details> |
| **[A Comprehensive Evaluation of Graph Neural Networks and Physics Informed Learning for Surrogate Modelling of Finite Element Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15750v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is an integral part of the product design lifecycle, the analysis is computationally expensive, making it unsuitable for many design optimization problems. The deep learning models can be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws. Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of 3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN) significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution. It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables.

The general chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT) significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes. Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference in industrial drug discovery workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphTARIF: Linear Graph Transformer with Augmented Rank and Improved Focus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10631v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However, existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map. Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG) framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics. To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more generalizable and robust neural representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Does Global Attention Help? A Unified Empirical Study on Atomistic Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05583v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN - that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model development.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 8 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Quantifying Long-Range Interactions in Graph Machine Learning: a Large Graph Dataset and a Measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09008v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-range dependencies are critical for effective graph representation learning, yet most existing datasets focus on small graphs tailored to inductive tasks, offering limited insight into long-range interactions. Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city road networks. This dataset features graphs with over 100k nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs based on local node eccentricities, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement-particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution-which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Inferring Pluggable Types with Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15676v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pluggable type systems allow programmers to extend the type system of a programming language to enforce semantic properties defined by the programmer. Pluggable type systems are difficult to deploy in legacy codebases because they require programmers to write type annotations manually. This paper investigates how to use machine learning to infer type qualifiers automatically. We propose a novel representation, NaP-AST, that encodes minimal dataflow hints for the effective inference of type qualifiers. We evaluate several model architectures for inferring type qualifiers, including Graph Transformer Network, Graph Convolutional Network and Large Language Model. We further validated these models by applying them to 12 open-source programs from a prior evaluation of the NullAway pluggable typechecker, lowering warnings in all but one unannotated project. We discovered that GTN shows the best performance, with a recall of .89 and precision of 0.6. Furthermore, we conduct a study to estimate the number of Java classes needed for good performance of the trained model. For our feasibility study, performance improved around 16k classes, and deteriorated due to overfitting around 22k classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Representation of Stiffened Panels with Non-Uniform Boundary Conditions and Loads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02472v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surrogate models are essential in structural analysis and optimization. We propose a heterogeneous graph representation of stiffened panels that accounts for geometrical variability, non-uniform boundary conditions, and diverse loading scenarios, using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The structure is partitioned into multiple structural units, such as stiffeners and the plates between them, with each unit represented by three distinct node types: geometry, boundary, and loading nodes. Edge heterogeneity is introduced by incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting nodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees of heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are implemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises stress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and degrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams composed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The heterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart, demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, an ablation analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of graph heterogeneity on HGT performance. The results show strong predictive accuracy for both displacement and von Mises stress, effectively capturing structural behavior patterns and maximum values.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint and has been submitted to Engineering with Computers</p></details> |

These reviews pose significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets, a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era.

This paper presents the first attempt to estimate 3D human body mesh from sparse LiDAR point clouds. We found that the major challenge in estimating human pose and mesh from point clouds lies in the sparsity, noise, and incompletion of LiDAR point clouds. Facing these challenges, we propose an effective sparse-to-dense reconstruction scheme to reconstruct 3D human mesh. This involves estimating a sparse representation of a human (3D human pose) and gradually reconstructing the body mesh. To better leverage the 3D structural information of point clouds, we employ a cascaded graph transformer (graphormer) to introduce point cloud features during sparse-to-dense reconstruction. Experimental results on three publicly available databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

First-principles approaches are accurate but computationally intensive. Recent years, machine learning (ML) has been extensively applied to this field, while existing ML models predominantly focus on band gap predictions or indirect band structure estimation via solving predicted Hamiltonians. An end-to-end model to predict band structure accurately and efficiently is still lacking. Here, we introduce a graph Transformer-based end-to-end approach that directly predicts band structures from crystal structures with high accuracy. Our method leverages the continuity of the k-path and treat continuous bands as a sequence. We demonstrate that our model not only provides accurate band structure predictions but also can derive other properties (such as band gap, band center, and band dispersion) with high accuracy. We verify the model performance on large and diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Integrated Multimodal Concept Bottleneck Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00701v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning. MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Graph Neural Networks are Incomplete on Graphs with a Simple Spectrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05530v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet, these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on graphs from ZINC.</p></details> | 10 pages main text |
| **[AI-Enhanced Multi-Dimensional Measurement of Technological Convergence through Heterogeneous Graph and Semantic Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21187v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technological convergence refers to the phenomenon where boundaries between technological areas and disciplines are increasingly blurred. It enables the integration of previously distinct domains and has become a mainstream trend in today's innovation process. However, accurately measuring technological convergence remains a persistent challenge due to its inherently multidimensional and evolving nature. This study designs an Technological Convergence Index (TCI) that comprehensively measures convergence along two fundamental dimensions: depth and breadth. For depth calculation, we use IPC textual descriptions as the analytical foundation and enhance this assessment by incorporating supplementary patent metadata into a heterogeneous graph structure. This graph is then modeled using Heterogeneous Graph Transformers in combination with Sentence-BERT, enabling a precise representation of knowledge integration across technological boundaries. Complementing this, the breadth dimension captures the diversity of technological fields involved, quantified through the Shannon Diversity Index to measure the variety of technological combinations within patents. Our final TCI is constructed using the Entropy Weight Method, which objectively assigns weights to both dimensions based on their information entropy. To validate our approach, we compare the proposed TCI against established convergence measures, demonstrating its comparative advantages. We further establish empirical reliability through a novel robustness test that regresses TCI against indicators of patent quality. These findings are further substantiated through comprehensive robustness checks. Our multidimensional approach provides valuable practical insights for innovation policy and industry strategies in managing emerging cross-domain technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphUniverse: Enabling Systematic Evaluation of Inductive Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21097v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph, transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure. Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at https://graphuniverse.streamlit.app.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Graph-Transformer Out-of-Distribution Generalization Abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20575v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID) benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts. Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without specialized DG algorithms (on four out of six benchmarks). Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets, specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Highlighting its model-agnostic design, the method yielded valuable insights into both GT and MPNN backbones and appears well suited for broader DG applications beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.</p></details> |  |

Accurate classification of ncRNAs is essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis. To address existing limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion, we propose HGMamba-ncRNA, a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model, which integrates sequence, secondary structure, and optionally available expression features of ncRNAs to enhance classification performance. Specifically, the sequence of ncRNA is modeled using a parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM architecture (MKC-L) to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies of nucleotides. The structure modality employs a multi-scale graph transformer (MSGraphTransformer) to represent the multi-level topological characteristics of ncRNA secondary structures. The expression modality utilizes a Chebyshev Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CPKAN) to effectively model and interpret high-dimensional expression profiles. Finally, by incorporating virtual nodes to facilitate efficient and comprehensive multimodal interaction, HyperGraphMamba is proposed to adaptively align and integrate multichannel heterogeneous modality features. Experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Extensive empirical studies further confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong transferability, offering a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA functional classification.

| **[Local equivalence of stabilizer states: a graphical characterisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20183v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stabilizer states form a ubiquitous family of quantum states that can be graphically represented through the graph state formalism. A fundamental property of graph states is that applying a local complementation - a well-known and extensively studied graph transformation - results in a graph that represents the same entanglement as the original. In other words, the corresponding graph states are LU-equivalent. This property served as the cornerstone for capturing non-trivial quantum properties in a simple graphical manner, in the study of quantum entanglement but also for developing protocols and models based on graph states and stabilizer states, such as measurement-based quantum computing, secret sharing, error correction, entanglement distribution... However, local complementation fails short to fully characterise entanglement: there exist pairs of graph states that are LU-equivalent but cannot be transformed one into the other using local complementations. Only few is known about the equivalence of graph states beyond local complementation. We introduce a generalisation of local complementation which graphically characterises the LU-equivalence of graph states. We use this characterisation to show the existence of a strict infinite hierarchy of equivalences of graph states. Our approach is based on minimal local sets, which are subsets of vertices that are known to cover any graph, and to be invariant under local complementation and even LU-equivalence. We use these structures to provide a type to each vertex of a graph, leading to a natural standard form in which the LU-equivalence can be exhibited and captured by means of generalised local complementation.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method, IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology. The code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IPGPhormer-6EEB.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%.

| **[From Fact to Judgment: Investigating the Impact of Task Framing on LLM Conviction in Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10871v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from "Is this statement correct?" to "Is this speaker correct?". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal ("The previous answer is incorrect.") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

However, the external knowledge may contain noise and conflict with the parametric knowledge of LLMs, leading to degraded performance. Current LLMs lack inherent mechanisms for resolving such conflicts. To fill this gap, we propose a Dual-Stream Knowledge-Augmented Framework for Shared-Private Semantic Synergy (DSSP-RAG). Central to it is the refinement of the traditional self-attention into a mixed-attention that distinguishes shared and private semantics for a controlled knowledge integration. An unsupervised hallucination detection method that captures the LLMs' intrinsic cognitive uncertainty ensures that external knowledge is introduced only when necessary. To reduce noise in external knowledge, an Energy Quotient (EQ), defined by attention difference matrices between task-aligned and task-misaligned layers, is proposed. Extensive experiments show that DSSP-RAG achieves a superior performance over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

Focusing on the scientist subset, I show that widely available LLMs with web search and agentic capabilities can link six out of twenty-four interviews to specific scientific works, recovering associated authors and, in some cases, uniquely identifying the interviewees. My contribution is to show that modern LLM-based agents make such re-identification attacks easy and low-effort: off-the-shelf tools can, with a few natural-language prompts, search the web, cross-reference details, and propose likely matches, effectively lowering the technical barrier. Existing safeguards can be bypassed by breaking down the re-identification into benign tasks. I outline the attack at a high level, discuss implications for releasing rich qualitative data in the age of LLM agents, and propose mitigation recommendations and open problems. I have notified Anthropic of my findings.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Diagnosing LLM Truthfulness via Neighborhood Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05905v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world settings, correctness alone is insufficient. Reliable deployment requires maintaining truthful beliefs under contextual perturbations. Existing evaluations largely rely on point-wise confidence like Self-Consistency, which can mask brittle belief. We show that even facts answered with perfect self-consistency can rapidly collapse under mild contextual interference. To address this gap, we propose Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB), a structural measure of belief robustness that evaluates response coherence across a conceptual neighborhood. To validate the efficiency of NCB, we introduce a new cognitive stress-testing protocol that probes outputs stability under contextual interference. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that the performance of high-NCB data is relatively more resistant to interference. Finally, we present Structure-Aware Training (SAT), which optimizes context-invariant belief structure and reduces long-tail knowledge brittleness by approximately 30%. Code will be available at https://github.com/zjunlp/belief.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, existing approaches typically focus on selecting LLM architectures while overlooking parameter settings, which are critical for task performance. In this paper, we introduce HAPS, a hierarchical LLM routing framework that jointly searches over model architectures and parameters. Specifically, we use a high-level router to select among candidate LLM architectures, and then search for the optimal parameters for the selected architectures based on a low-level router. We design a parameter generation network to share parameters between the two routers to mutually enhance their capabilities. In the training process, we design a reward-augmented objective to effectively optimize our framework. Experiments on two commonly used benchmarks show that HAPS consistently outperforms strong routing baselines. We have released our code at https://github.com/zihangtian/HAPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[TowerMind: A Tower Defence Game Learning Environment and Benchmark for LLM as Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05899v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a promising paradigm for agents, with long-term planning and decision-making emerging as core general-purpose capabilities for adapting to diverse scenarios and tasks. Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field. The source code is publicly available on GitHub(https://github.com/tb6147877/TowerMind).</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Oral |

This study investigates ideological framing bias in LLM-generated articles, focusing on the subtle and subjective nature of such bias in journalistic contexts. We evaluate eight widely used LLMs on two datasets-POLIGEN and ECONOLEX-covering political and economic discourse where framing bias is most pronounced. Beyond text generation, LLMs are increasingly used as evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge), providing feedback that can shape human judgment or inform newer model versions. Inspired by the Socratic method, we further analyze LLMs' feedback on their own outputs to identify inconsistencies in their reasoning. Our results show that most LLMs can accurately annotate ideologically framed text, with GPT-4o achieving human-level accuracy and high agreement with human annotators. However, Socratic probing reveals that when confronted with binary comparisons, LLMs often exhibit preference toward one perspective or perceive certain viewpoints as less biased.</p></details> |  |

Laypeople use these tools intuitively, which may lead them to form expectations based on incomplete, incorrect, or biased outputs. This study examines whether leading LLMs exhibit gender bias in their responses to a realistic family law scenario. We present an expert-designed divorce scenario grounded in Czech family law and evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-5 nano, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Llama 3.3 in a fully zero-shot interaction. We deploy two versions of the scenario, one with gendered names and one with neutral labels, to establish a baseline for comparison. We further introduce nine legally relevant factors that vary the factual circumstances of the case and test whether these variations influence the models' proposed shared-parenting ratios. Our preliminary results highlight differences across models and suggest gender-dependent patterns in the outcomes generated by some systems. The findings underscore both the risks associated with laypeople's reliance on LLMs for legal guidance and the need for more robust evaluation of model behavior in sensitive legal contexts. We present exploratory and descriptive evidence intended to identify systematic asymmetries rather than to establish causal effects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI for Access to Justice, Dispute Resolution, and Data Access (AIDA2J) at Jurix 2025, Torino, Italy</p></details> |

Evaluating LLM Framing in News Classification and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05835v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) based summarization and text generation are increasingly used for producing and rewriting text, raising concerns about political framing in journalism where subtle wording choices can shape interpretation. Across nine state-of-the-art LLMs, we study political framing by testing whether LLMs' classification-based bias signals align with framing behavior in their generated summaries. We first compare few-shot ideology predictions against LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT labels. We then generate "steered" summaries under FAITHFUL, CENTRIST, LEFT, and RIGHT prompts, and score all outputs using a single fixed ideology evaluator. We find pervasive ideological center-collapse in both article-level ratings and generated text, indicating a systematic tendency toward centrist framing. Among evaluated models, Grok 4 is by far the most ideologically expressive generator, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Llama 3.1 achieve the strongest bias-rating performance among commercial and open-weight models, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs as verification oracles for Solidity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19153v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the correctness of smart contracts is critical, as even subtle flaws can lead to severe financial losses. While bug detection tools able to spot common vulnerability patterns can serve as a first line of defense, most real-world exploits and losses stem from errors in the contract business logic. Formal verification tools such as SolCMC and the Certora Prover address this challenge, but their impact remains limited by steep learning curves and restricted specification languages. Recent works have begun to explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for security-related tasks such as vulnerability detection and test generation. Yet, a fundamental question remains open: can LLMs aid in assessing the validity of arbitrary contract-specific properties? In this paper, we provide the first systematic empirical evaluation of GPT-5, a state-of-the-art reasoning LLM, in this role. We benchmark its performance on a large dataset of verification tasks, compare its outputs against those of established formal verification tools, and assess its practical effectiveness in real-world auditing scenarios. Our study combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, and shows that recent reasoning-oriented LLMs - although lacking soundness guarantees - can be surprisingly effective at predicting the (in)validity of complex properties, suggesting a new frontier in the convergence of AI and formal methods for secure smart contract development and auditing.</p></details> |  |

Although existing general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist in this endeavor, they are not optimally aligned for it. To address this, we propose a framework for training LLMs to emulate the role of a science journalist that can be used by early-stage researchers to learn how to properly communicate their papers to the general public. We evaluate the usefulness of our trained LLM Journalists in leading conversations with both simulated and human researchers. %compared to the general-purpose ones. Our experiments indicate that LLMs trained using our framework ask more relevant questions that address the societal impact of research, prompting researchers to clarify and elaborate on their findings. In the user study, the majority of participants who interacted with our trained LLM Journalist appreciated it more than interacting with general-purpose LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, access to real systems is often restricted; LLM-simulated environments are prone to hallucinations and inconsistencies; and manually built sandboxes are hard to scale. In this paper, we propose EnvScaler, an automated framework for scalable tool-interaction environments via programmatic synthesis. EnvScaler comprises two components. First, SkelBuilder constructs diverse environment skeletons through topic mining, logic modeling, and quality evaluation. Then, ScenGenerator generates multiple task scenarios and rule-based trajectory validation functions for each environment. With EnvScaler, we synthesize 191 environments and about 7K scenarios, and apply them to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Qwen3 series models. Results on three benchmarks show that EnvScaler significantly improves LLMs' ability to solve tasks in complex environments involving multi-turn, multi-tool interactions. We release our code and data at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/EnvScaler.</p></details> | Working in progress |

This paper addresses the challenge of mapping the complexity of human language to the structured action space of modular ADS software. We propose a framework that integrates an LLM-based interaction layer with Autoware, a widely used open-source software. This system enables passengers to issue high-level commands, from querying status information to modifying driving behavior. Our methodology is grounded in three key components: a taxonomization of interaction categories, an application-centric Domain Specific Language (DSL) for command translation, and a safety-preserving validation layer. A two-stage LLM architecture ensures high transparency by providing feedback based on the definitive execution status. Evaluation confirms the system's timing efficiency and translation robustness. Simulation successfully validated command execution across all five interaction categories. This work provides a foundation for extensible, DSL-assisted interaction in modular and safety-conscious autonomy stacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2026), Detroit, MI, United States</p></details> |

We introduce Simplify-This, a comparative study evaluating both paradigms for text simplification with encoder-decoder LLMs across multiple benchmarks, using a range of evaluation metrics. Fine-tuned models consistently deliver stronger structural simplification, whereas prompting often attains higher semantic similarity scores yet tends to copy inputs. A human evaluation favors fine-tuned outputs overall. We release code, a cleaned derivative dataset used in our study, checkpoints of fine-tuned models, and prompt templates to facilitate reproducibility and future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection of LLM-Paraphrased Code and Identification of the Responsible LLM Using Coding Style Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17749v3)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) for code generation has raised serious concerns about intellectual property protection. Malicious users can exploit LLMs to produce paraphrased versions of proprietary code that closely resemble the original. While the potential for LLM-assisted code paraphrasing continues to grow, research on detecting it remains limited, underscoring an urgent need for detection system. We respond to this need by proposing two tasks. The first task is to detect whether code generated by an LLM is a paraphrased version of original human-written code. The second task is to identify which LLM is used to paraphrase the original code. For these tasks, we construct a dataset LPcode consisting of pairs of human-written code and LLM-paraphrased code using various LLMs. We statistically confirm significant differences in the coding styles of human-written and LLM-paraphrased code, particularly in terms of naming consistency, code structure, and readability. Based on these findings, we develop LPcodedec, a detection method that identifies paraphrase relationships between human-written and LLM-generated code, and discover which LLM is used for the paraphrasing. LPcodedec outperforms the best baselines in two tasks, improving F1 scores by 2.64% and 15.17% while achieving speedups of 1,343x and 213x, respectively.

Existing defenses encounter a critical dilemma as advanced models prioritize injected rules due to strict alignment while static protection mechanisms sever the feedback loop required for adaptive reasoning. To reconcile this conflict, we propose \textbf{VIGIL}, a framework that shifts the paradigm from restrictive isolation to a verify-before-commit protocol. By facilitating speculative hypothesis generation and enforcing safety through intent-grounded verification, \textbf{VIGIL} preserves reasoning flexibility while ensuring robust control. We further introduce \textbf{SIREN}, a benchmark comprising 959 tool stream injection cases designed to simulate pervasive threats characterized by dynamic dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{VIGIL} outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic defenses by reducing the attack success rate by over 22\% while more than doubling the utility under attack compared to static baselines, thereby achieving an optimal balance between security and utility.

AutoMonitor-Bench consists of 3,010 carefully annotated test samples spanning question answering, code generation, and reasoning, with paired misbehavior and benign instances. We evaluate monitors using two complementary metrics: Miss Rate (MR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR), capturing failures to detect misbehavior and oversensitivity to benign behavior, respectively. Evaluating 12 proprietary and 10 open-source LLMs, we observe substantial variability in monitoring performance and a consistent trade-off between MR and FAR, revealing an inherent safety-utility tension. To further explore the limits of monitor reliability, we construct a large-scale training corpus of 153,581 samples and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruction to investigate whether training on known, relatively easy-to-construct misbehavior datasets improves monitoring performance on unseen and more implicit misbehaviors. Our results highlight the challenges of reliable, scalable misbehavior monitoring and motivate future work on task-aware designing and training strategies for LLM-based monitors.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has shown that LLMs can successfully persuade humans and amplify persuasive language. It is therefore essential to understand how user instructions affect the generation of persuasive language, and to understand whether the generated persuasive language differs, for example, when targeting different groups. In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating how persuasive language generation is affected by recipient gender, sender intent, or output language. We evaluate 13 LLMs and 16 languages using pairwise prompt instructions. We evaluate model responses on 19 categories of persuasive language using an LLM-as-judge setup grounded in social psychology and communication science. Our results reveal significant gender differences in the persuasive language generated across all models. These patterns reflect biases consistent with gender-stereotypical linguistic tendencies documented in social psychology and sociolinguistics.</p></details> |  |

As companies deploy these tools, security challenges need to be addressed to prevent financial loss and reputational damage. A key security challenge is jailbreaking, the malicious manipulation of prompts and inputs to bypass a chatbot's safety guardrails. Multi-turn attacks are a relatively new form of jailbreaking involving a carefully crafted chain of interactions with a chatbot. We introduce Echo Chamber, a new multi-turn attack using a gradual escalation method. We describe this attack in detail, compare it to other multi-turn attacks, and demonstrate its performance against multiple state-of-the-art models through extensive evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logic-Parametric Neuro-Symbolic NLI: Controlling Logical Formalisms for Verifiable LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05705v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and theorem provers (TPs) can be effectively combined for verifiable natural language inference (NLI). However, existing approaches rely on a fixed logical formalism, a feature that limits robustness and adaptability. We propose a logic-parametric framework for neuro-symbolic NLI that treats the underlying logic not as a static background, but as a controllable component. Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, existing low-rank PTQ methods require costly fine-tuning to determine a compromise rank for diverse data and layers in large models, failing to exploit their full potential. Additionally, the current SVD-based low-rank approximation compounds the computational overhead. In this work, we thoroughly analyze the varying effectiveness of low-rank approximation across different layers in representative models. Accordingly, we introduce \underline{F}lexible \underline{L}ow-\underline{R}ank \underline{Q}uantization (FLRQ), a novel solution designed to quickly identify the accuracy-optimal ranks and aggregate them to achieve minimal storage combinations. FLRQ comprises two powerful components, Rank1-Sketch-based Flexible Rank Selection (R1-FLR) and Best Low-rank Approximation under Clipping (BLC). R1-FLR applies the R1-Sketch with Gaussian projection for the fast low-rank approximation, enabling outlier-aware rank extraction for each layer. Meanwhile, BLC aims at minimizing the low-rank quantization error under the scaling and clipping strategy through an iterative method. FLRQ demonstrates strong effectiveness and robustness in comprehensive experiments, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both quantization quality and algorithm efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differential syntactic and semantic encoding in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04765v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how syntactic and semantic information is encoded in inner layer representations of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on the very large DeepSeek-V3. We find that, by averaging hidden-representation vectors of sentences sharing syntactic structure or meaning, we obtain vectors that capture a significant proportion of the syntactic and semantic information contained in the representations. In particular, subtracting these syntactic and semantic ``centroids'' from sentence vectors strongly affects their similarity with syntactically and semantically matched sentences, respectively, suggesting that syntax and semantics are, at least partially, linearly encoded. We also find that the cross-layer encoding profiles of syntax and semantics are different, and that the two signals can to some extent be decoupled, suggesting differential encoding of these two types of linguistic information in LLM representations.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we take an exploratory step toward privacy-preserving continual pretraining by proposing an entity-based framework that synthesizes encrypted training data to protect personally identifiable information (PII). Our approach constructs a weighted entity graph to guide data synthesis and applies deterministic encryption to PII entities, enabling LLMs to encode new knowledge through continual pretraining while granting authorized access to sensitive data through decryption keys. Our results on limited-scale datasets demonstrate that our pretrained models outperform base models and ensure PII security, while exhibiting a modest performance gap compared to models trained on unencrypted synthetic data. We further show that increasing the number of entities and leveraging graph-based synthesis improves model performance, and that encrypted models retain instruction-following capabilities with long retrieved contexts. We discuss the security implications and limitations of deterministic encryption, positioning this work as an initial investigation into the design space of encrypted data pretraining for privacy-preserving LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/DataArcTech/SoE.</p></details> |  |
| **[GIFT: Games as Informal Training for Generalizable LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05633v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in formal learning tasks such as mathematics and code generation, they still struggle with the "practical wisdom" and generalizable intelligence, such as strategic creativity and social reasoning, that characterize human cognition. This gap arises from a lack of informal learning, which thrives on interactive feedback rather than goal-oriented instruction. In this paper, we propose treating Games as a primary environment for LLM informal learning, leveraging their intrinsic reward signals and abstracted complexity to cultivate diverse competencies. To address the performance degradation observed in multi-task learning, we introduce a Nested Training Framework. Unlike naive task mixing optimizing an implicit "OR" objective, our framework employs sequential task composition to enforce an explicit "AND" objective, compelling the model to master multiple abilities simultaneously to achieve maximal rewards. Using GRPO-based reinforcement learning across Matrix Games, TicTacToe, and Who's the Spy games, we demonstrate that integrating game-based informal learning not only prevents task interference but also significantly bolsters the model's generalization across broad ability-oriented benchmarks. The framework and implementation are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Phase LLM Reasoning: Self-Evolved Mathematical Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05616v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in complex reasoning tasks like mathematical problem-solving. However, existing research predominantly relies on reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks while overlooking supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods. This paper proposes a new two-stage training framework that enhances models' self-correction capabilities through self-generated long chain-of-thought (CoT) data. During the first stage, a multi-turn dialogue strategy guides the model to generate CoT data incorporating verification, backtracking, subgoal decomposition, and backward reasoning, with predefined rules filtering high-quality samples for supervised fine-tuning. The second stage employs a difficulty-aware rejection sampling mechanism to dynamically optimize data distribution, strengthening the model's ability to handle complex problems. The approach generates reasoning chains extended over 4 times longer while maintaining strong scalability, proving that SFT effectively activates models' intrinsic reasoning capabilities and provides a resource-efficient pathway for complex task optimization. Experimental results demonstrate performance improvements on mathematical benchmarks including GSM8K and MATH500, with the fine-tuned model achieving a substantial improvement on competition-level problems like AIME24. Code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformity Dynamics in LLM Multi-Agent Systems: The Roles of Topology and Self-Social Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05606v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly instantiated as interacting agents in multi-agent systems (MAS), where collective decisions emerge through social interaction rather than independent reasoning. A fundamental yet underexplored mechanism in this process is conformity, the tendency of agents to align their judgments with prevailing group opinions. This paper presents a systematic study of how network topology shapes conformity dynamics in LLM-based MAS through a misinformation detection task. We introduce a confidence-normalized pooling rule that controls the trade-off between self-reliance and social influence, enabling comparisons between two canonical decision paradigms: Centralized Aggregation and Distributed Consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that network topology critically governs both the efficiency and robustness of collective judgments. Centralized structures enable immediate decisions but are sensitive to hub competence and exhibit same-model alignment biases. In contrast, distributed structures promote more robust consensus, while increased network connectivity speeds up convergence but also heightens the risk of wrong-but-sure cascades, in which agents converge on incorrect decisions with high confidence. These findings characterize the conformity dynamics in LLM-based MAS, clarifying how network topology and self-social weighting jointly shape the efficiency, robustness, and failure modes of collective decision-making.</p></details> | Under Review |

While some studies demonstrate that LLMs can achieve high user agreement with ground truth (human) judgments, other studies have argued for the opposite conclusion. To the best of our knowledge, these studies have primarily focused on classic ad-hoc text search scenarios. In this paper, we conduct an analysis on user agreement between LLM and human experts, and explore the impact disagreement has on system rankings. In contrast to prior studies, we focus on a collection composed of audio files that are transcribed into two-minute segments -- the TREC 2020 and 2021 podcast track. We employ five different LLM models to re-assess all of the query-segment pairs, which were originally annotated by TREC assessors. Furthermore, we re-assess a small subset of pairs where LLM and TREC assessors have the highest disagreement, and found that the human experts tend to agree with LLMs more than with the TREC assessors. Our results reinforce the previous insights of Sormunen in 2002 -- that relying on a single assessor leads to lower user agreement.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted to appear at ECIR 2026</p></details> |

Despite their critical role, LLM inference engines are prone to bugs due to the immense resource demands of LLMs and the complexities of cross-platform compatibility. However, a systematic understanding of these bugs remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present the first empirical study on bugs in LLM inference engines. We mine official repositories of 5 widely adopted LLM inference engines, constructing a comprehensive dataset of 929 real-world bugs. Through a rigorous open coding process, we analyze these bugs to uncover their symptoms, root causes, commonality, fix effort, fix strategies, and temporal evolution. Our findings reveal six bug symptom types and a taxonomy of 28 root causes, shedding light on the key challenges in bug detection and location within LLM inference engines. Based on these insights, we propose a series of actionable implications for researchers, inference engine vendors, and LLM app developers, along with general guidelines for developing LLM inference engines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |

Yet, robotic systems still fall short of matching biological dexterity. In this paper, we investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), tool affordances, and object manoeuvrability for non-prehensile tool-based manipulation tasks. Our novel method leverages LLMs based on scene information and natural language instructions to enable symbolic task planning for tool-object manipulation. This approach allows the system to convert a human language sentence into a sequence of feasible motion functions. We have developed a novel manoeuvrability-driven controller using a new tool affordance model derived from visual feedback. This controller helps guide the robot's tool utilization and manipulation actions, even within confined areas, using a stepping incremental approach. The proposed methodology is evaluated with experiments to prove its effectiveness under various manipulation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Achieving truly ``human-like'' communication necessitates a dual capability: emotional intelligence to perceive and resonate with users' emotional states, and robust interaction mechanisms to navigate the dynamic, natural flow of conversation, such as real-time turn-taking. Therefore, we launched the first Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (HumDial) at ICASSP 2026 to benchmark these dual capabilities. Anchored by a sizable dataset derived from authentic human conversations, this initiative establishes a fair evaluation platform across two tracks: (1) Emotional Intelligence, targeting long-term emotion understanding and empathetic generation; and (2) Full-Duplex Interaction, systematically evaluating real-time decision-making under `` listening-while-speaking'' conditions. This paper summarizes the dataset, track configurations, and the final results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Offic...</summary><p>Official summary paper for the ICASSP 2026 HumDial Challenge</p></details> |

However, existing techniques primarily generate regression oracles that predicate on the implemented behavior of the class under test. They do not address the oracle problem: the challenge of distinguishing correct from incorrect program behavior. With the rise of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a new opportunity to generate test oracles that reflect intended behavior. This positions LLMs as enablers of Promptware, where software creation and testing are driven by natural-language prompts. This paper presents an empirical study on the effectiveness of LLMs in generating test oracles that expose software failures. We investigate how different prompting strategies and levels of contextual input impact the quality of LLM-generated oracles. Our findings offer insights into the strengths and limitations of LLM-based oracle generation in the FM era, improving our understanding of their capabilities and fostering future research in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on AI-powered Software (AIware 2025)</p></details> |
| **[LIDL: LLM Integration Defect Localization via Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Multi-Agent Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05539v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-integrated software, which embeds or interacts with large language models (LLMs) as functional components, exhibits probabilistic and context-dependent behaviors that fundamentally differ from those of traditional software. This shift introduces a new category of integration defects that arise not only from code errors but also from misaligned interactions among LLM-specific artifacts, including prompts, API calls, configurations, and model outputs. However, existing defect localization techniques are ineffective at identifying these LLM-specific integration defects because they fail to capture cross-layer dependencies across heterogeneous artifacts, cannot exploit incomplete or misleading error traces, and lack semantic reasoning capabilities for identifying root causes. To address these challenges, we propose LIDL, a multi-agent framework for defect localization in LLM-integrated software. LIDL (1) constructs a code knowledge graph enriched with LLM-aware annotations that represent interaction boundaries across source code, prompts, and configuration files, (2) fuses three complementary sources of error evidence inferred by LLMs to surface candidate defect locations, and (3) applies context-aware validation that uses counterfactual reasoning to distinguish true root causes from propagated symptoms. We evaluate LIDL on 146 real-world defect instances collected from 105 GitHub repositories and 16 agent-based systems. The results show that LIDL significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines across all metrics, achieving a Top-3 accuracy of 0.64 and a MAP of 0.48, which represents a 64.1% improvement over the best-performing baseline. Notably, LIDL achieves these gains while reducing cost by 92.5%, demonstrating both high accuracy and cost efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Not Found (404): Hidden Risks of LLM-Based Robotics Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05529v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One mistake by an AI system in a safety-critical setting can cost lives. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how "rare" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEAPS: An LLM-Empowered Adaptive Plugin for Taobao AI Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05513v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models has reshaped user search cognition, driving a paradigm shift from discrete keyword-based search to high-dimensional conversational interaction. However, existing e-commerce search architectures face a critical capability deficit in adapting to this change. Users are often caught in a dilemma: precise natural language descriptions frequently trigger zero-result scenarios, while the forced simplification of queries leads to decision overload from noisy, generic results. To tackle this challenge, we propose LEAPS (LLM-Empowered Adaptive Plugin for Taobao AI Search), which seamlessly upgrades traditional search systems via a "Broaden-and-Refine" paradigm. Specifically, it attaches plugins to both ends of the search pipeline: (1) Upstream, a Query Expander acts as an intent translator. It employs a novel three-stage training strategy--inverse data augmentation, posterior-knowledge supervised fine-tuning, and diversity-aware reinforcement learning--to generate adaptive and complementary query combinations that maximize the candidate product set. (2) Downstream, a Relevance Verifier serves as a semantic gatekeeper. By synthesizing multi-source data (e.g., OCR text, reviews) and leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning, it precisely filters noise to resolve selection overload. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that LEAPS significantly enhances conversational search experiences. Crucially, its non-invasive architecture preserves established retrieval performance optimized for short-text queries, while simultaneously allowing for low-cost integration into diverse back-ends. Fully deployed on Taobao AI Search since August 2025, LEAPS currently serves hundreds of millions of users monthly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-Aware Temporal Projection for Video Understanding in Video-LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01804v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, yet remain challenged by video understanding tasks that require consistent temporal ordering and causal coherence. Many parameter-efficient Video-LLMs rely on unconstrained bidirectional projectors to model inter-frame interactions, which can blur temporal ordering by allowing later frames to influence earlier representations, without explicit architectural mechanisms to respect the directional nature of video reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose V-CORE, a parameter-efficient framework that introduces explicit temporal ordering constraints for video understanding. V-CORE consists of two key components: (1) Learnable Spatial Aggregation (LSA), which adaptively selects salient spatial tokens to reduce redundancy, and (2) a Causality-Aware Temporal Projector (CATP), which enforces structured unidirectional information flow via block-causal attention and a terminal dynamic summary token acting as a causal sink. This design preserves intra-frame spatial interactions while ensuring that temporal information is aggregated in a strictly ordered manner. With 4-bit QLoRA and a frozen LLM backbone, V-CORE can be trained efficiently on a single consumer GPU. Experiments show that V-CORE achieves strong performance on the challenging NExT-QA benchmark, reaching 61.2% accuracy, and remains competitive across MSVD-QA, MSRVTT-QA, and TGIF-QA, with gains concentrated in temporal and causal reasoning subcategories (+3.5% and +5.2% respectively), directly validating the importance of explicit temporal ordering constraints.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Memory Poisoning Attack and Defense on Memory Based LLM-Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05504v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model agents equipped with persistent memory are vulnerable to memory poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious instructions through query only interactions that corrupt the agents long term memory and influence future responses. Recent work demonstrated that the MINJA (Memory Injection Attack) achieves over 95 % injection success rate and 70 % attack success rate under idealized conditions. However, the robustness of these attacks in realistic deployments and effective defensive mechanisms remain understudied. This work addresses these gaps through systematic empirical evaluation of memory poisoning attacks and defenses in Electronic Health Record (EHR) agents. We investigate attack robustness by varying three critical dimensions: initial memory state, number of indication prompts, and retrieval parameters. Our experiments on GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct models using MIMIC-III clinical data reveal that realistic conditions with pre-existing legitimate memories dramatically reduce attack effectiveness. We then propose and evaluate two novel defense mechanisms: (1) Input/Output Moderation using composite trust scoring across multiple orthogonal signals, and (2) Memory Sanitization with trust-aware retrieval employing temporal decay and pattern-based filtering. Our defense evaluation reveals that effective memory sanitization requires careful trust threshold calibration to prevent both overly conservative rejection (blocking all entries) and insufficient filtering (missing subtle attacks), establishing important baselines for future adaptive defense mechanisms. These findings provide crucial insights for securing memory-augmented LLM agents in production environments.</p></details> |  |

Performance optimization, while critical, is a time-consuming and often manual process. One of the most complex tasks in this domain is modifying the Document Object Model (DOM), which is why this study focuses on it. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue to automate this complex task, potentially transforming how developers address web performance issues. This study evaluates the effectiveness of nine state-of-the-art LLMs for automated web performance issue resolution. For this purpose, we first extracted the DOM trees of 15 popular webpages (e.g., Facebook), and then we used Lighthouse to retrieve their performance audit reports. Subsequently, we passed the extracted DOM trees and corresponding audits to each model for resolution. Our study considers 7 unique audit categories, revealing that LLMs universally excel at SEO & Accessibility issues. However, their efficacy in performance-critical DOM manipulations is mixed. While high-performing models like GPT-4.1 delivered significant reductions in areas like Initial Load, Interactivity, and Network Optimization (e.g., 46.52% to 48.68% audit incidence reductions), others, such as GPT-4o-mini, notably underperformed, consistently. A further analysis of these modifications showed a predominant additive strategy and frequent positional changes, alongside regressions particularly impacting Visual Stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the The ACM International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) (MSR 2026)</p></details> |

Conversely, zeroth-order (ZO) methods offer stronger exploratory behavior without relying on explicit gradients, yet suffer from slow convergence. More critically, our analysis reveals that in generative tasks, the vast output and search space significantly amplify estimation variance, rendering ZO methods both noisy and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Hi-ZFO} (\textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{Z}eroth- and \textbf{F}irst-\textbf{O}rder optimization), a hybrid framework designed to synergize the precision of FO gradients with the exploratory capability of ZO estimation. Hi-ZFO adaptively partitions the model through layer-wise importance profiling, applying precise FO updates to critical layers while leveraging ZO optimization for less sensitive ones. Notably, ZO in Hi-ZFO is not merely a memory-saving surrogate; it is intentionally introduced as a source of "beneficial stochasticity" to help the model escape the local minima where pure FO optimization tends to stagnate. Validated across diverse generative, mathematical, and code reasoning tasks, Hi-ZFO consistently achieves superior performance while significantly reducing the training time. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical hybrid optimization for LLM fine-tuning.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[The Evaluation Gap in Medicine, AI and LLMs: Navigating Elusive Ground Truth & Uncertainty via a Probabilistic Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05500v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking the relative capabilities of AI systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Models, typically ignores the impact of uncertainty in the underlying ground truth answers from experts. This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability. Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pragmatic Reasoning improves LLM Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15835v4)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pragmatic reasoning is pervasive in human-human communication - it allows us to leverage shared knowledge and counterfactual reasoning in order to infer the intention of a conversational partner given their ambiguous or underspecified message. In human-computer communication, underspecified messages often represent a major challenge: for instance, translating natural language instructions into code is difficult when user instructions contain inherent ambiguities. In the present paper, we aim to scale up the pragmatic "Rational Speech Act" framework to naturalistic language-to-code problems, and propose a way of dealing with multiple meaning-equivalent instruction alternatives, an issue that does not arise in previous toy-scale problems. We evaluate our method, CodeRSA, with two recent LLMs (Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct) on two widely used code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP). Our experimental results show that CodeRSA consistently outperforms common baselines, surpasses the state-of-the-art approach in most cases, and demonstrates robust overall performance. Qualitative analyses demonstrate that it exhibits the desired behavior for the right reasons. These findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating pragmatic reasoning into a naturalistic complex communication task, language-to-code generation, offering a promising direction for enhancing code generation quality in LLMs and emphasizing the importance of pragmatic reasoning in complex communication settings.</p></details> |  |

While memory-augmented frameworks offer a structured alternative, current systems rely on static prompting of closed-source models or suffer from ineffective training paradigms with sparse rewards. We introduce MemBuilder, a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to orchestrate multi-dimensional memory construction with attributed dense rewards. MemBuilder addresses two key challenges: (1) Sparse Trajectory-Level Rewards: we employ synthetic session-level question generation to provide dense intermediate rewards across extended trajectories; and (2) Multi-Dimensional Memory Attribution: we introduce contribution-aware gradient weighting that scales policy updates based on each component's downstream impact. Experimental results show that MemBuilder enables a 4B-parameter model to outperform state-of-the-art closed-source baselines, exhibiting strong generalization across long-term dialogue benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages (9 main + 10 appendix), 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

While current models resist explicit misinformation, we uncover a fundamental vulnerability to sophisticated, hard-to-falsify evidence. To systematically probe this weakness, we introduce MisBelief, a framework that generates misleading evidence via collaborative, multi-round interactions among multi-role LLMs. This process mimics subtle, defeasible reasoning and progressive refinement to create logically persuasive yet factually deceptive claims. Using MisBelief, we generate 4,800 instances across three difficulty levels to evaluate 7 representative LLMs. Results indicate that while models are robust to direct misinformation, they are highly sensitive to this refined evidence: belief scores in falsehoods increase by an average of 93.0\%, fundamentally compromising downstream recommendations. To address this, we propose Deceptive Intent Shielding (DIS), a governance mechanism that provides an early warning signal by inferring the deceptive intent behind evidence. Empirical results demonstrate that DIS consistently mitigates belief shifts and promotes more cautious evidence evaluation.</p></details> |  |

AI agents offer a paradigm shift, enabling adaptive planning, executable code generation, traceable decisions, and real-time knowledge fusion. However, the lack of a comprehensive benchmark critically hinders progress. We introduce a novel benchmarking evaluation system to rigorously assess agent capabilities in single-cell omics analysis. This system comprises: a unified platform compatible with diverse agent frameworks and LLMs; multidimensional metrics assessing cognitive program synthesis, collaboration, execution efficiency, bioinformatics knowledge integration, and task completion quality; and 50 diverse real-world single-cell omics analysis tasks spanning multi-omics, species, and sequencing technologies. Our evaluation reveals that Grok-3-beta achieves state-of-the-art performance among tested agent frameworks. Multi-agent frameworks significantly enhance collaboration and execution efficiency over single-agent approaches through specialized role division. Attribution analyses of agent capabilities identify that high-quality code generation is crucial for task success, and self-reflection has the most significant overall impact, followed by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and planning. This work highlights persistent challenges in code generation, long-context handling, and context-aware knowledge retrieval, providing a critical empirical foundation and best practices for developing robust AI agents in computational biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 mai...</summary><p>6 main figures; 13 supplementary figures</p></details> |

Multi-agentic collaborative frameworks using such LLMs place them at the center of solving software development-related tasks such as code generation. However, direct use of LLM generated code in production software development systems is problematic. The code could be unstable or erroneous and contain vulnerabilities such as data poisoning, malicious attacks, and hallucinations that could lead to widespread system malfunctions. This prohibits the adoption of LLM generated code in production AI systems where human code reviews and traditional secure testing tools are impractical or untrustworthy. In this paper, we discuss safety and reliability problems with the execution of LLM generated code and propose a Secure Transpiler and Executor of LLM-Generated Program (STELP), capable of executing LLM-generated code in a controlled and safe manner. STELP secures autonomous production AI systems involving code generation, filling the critical void left by the impracticality or limitations of traditional secure testing methodologies and human oversight. This includes applications such as headless code generation-execution and LLMs that produce executable code snippets as an action plan to be executed in real time. We contribute a human-validated dataset of insecure code snippets and benchmark our approach on publicly available datasets for correctness, safety, and latency. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms an existing method by a significant margin, particularly in its ability to safely execute risky code snippets. Warning: This paper contains malicious code snippets that should be run with caution.</p></details> |  |

A Study in Korean Self-Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05459v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and self-correction abilities in high-resource languages like English, but their performance remains limited in low-resource languages such as Korean. In this study, we investigate whether reinforcement learning (RL) can enhance Korean reasoning abilities to a degree comparable to English. Our findings reveal that RL alone yields limited improvements when applied to models lacking inherent Korean reasoning capabilities. To address this, we explore several fine-tuning strategies and show that aligning the model's internal reasoning processes with Korean inputs-particularly by tuning Korean-specific neurons in early layers-is key to unlocking RL's effectiveness. We introduce a self-correction code-switching dataset to facilitate this alignment and observe significant performance gains in both mathematical reasoning and self-correction tasks. Ultimately, we conclude that the crucial factor in multilingual reasoning enhancement is not injecting new linguistic knowledge, but effectively eliciting and aligning existing reasoning capabilities. Our study provides a new perspective on how internal translation and neuron-level tuning contribute to multilingual reasoning alignment in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCNL...</summary><p>IJCNLP-AACL 2025 (Main), Outstanding Paper Award</p></details> |

Thus the efficacy of machine learning (ML) algorithms is closely related to the quality of feature engineering. As one of the most important techniques, feature generation transforms raw data into an optimized feature space conducive to model training and further refines the space. Despite the advancements in automated feature engineering and feature generation, current methodologies often suffer from three fundamental issues: lack of explainability, limited applicability, and inflexible strategy. These shortcomings frequently hinder and limit the deployment of ML models across varied scenarios. Our research introduces a novel approach adopting large language models (LLMs) and feature-generating prompts to address these challenges. We propose a dynamic and adaptive feature generation method that enhances the interpretability of the feature generation process. Our approach broadens the applicability across various data types and tasks and offers advantages over strategic flexibility.

In practice, LLM judges are imperfect predictions for the underlying truth and can exhibit systematic, non-random errors. Two main approaches have recently been proposed to address this issue: (i) direct measurementerror correction based on misclassification models such as Rogan-Gladen-style estimators, and (ii) surrogate-outcome approaches such as prediction-powered inference (PPI), which correct bias by calibrating prediction residuals on a small set of gold-standard human labels. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of these two approaches for estimating mean parameters (e.g., average benchmark scores or pairwise win rates). Leveraging tools from semiparametric efficiency theory, we unify the two classes of estimators by deriving explicit forms of efficient influence function (EIF)-based efficient estimators and characterize conditions under which PPI-style estimators attain strictly smaller asymptotic variance than measurement-error corrections. We verify our theoretical results in simulations and demonstrate the methods on real-data examples. We provide an implementation of the benchmarked methods and comparison utilities at https://github.com/yiqunchen/debias-llm-as-a-judge.</p></details> |  |

We present the first large-scale, statistically powered audit of native probabilistic sampling in frontier LLMs, benchmarking 11 models across 15 distributions. To disentangle failure modes, we employ a dual-protocol design: Batch Generation, where a model produces N=1000 samples within one response, and Independent Requests, comprising $N=1000$ stateless calls. We observe a sharp protocol asymmetry: batch generation achieves only modest statistical validity, with a 13% median pass rate, while independent requests collapse almost entirely, with 10 of 11 models passing none of the distributions. Beyond this asymmetry, we reveal that sampling fidelity degrades monotonically with distributional complexity and aggravates as the requested sampling horizon N increases. Finally, we demonstrate the propagation of these failures into downstream tasks: models fail to enforce uniform answer-position constraints in MCQ generation and systematically violate demographic targets in attribute-constrained text-to-image prompt synthesis. These findings indicate that current LLMs lack a functional internal sampler, necessitating the use of external tools for applications requiring statistical guarantees.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate DafnyPro using Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7 on four benchmarks: Clover, MBPP-Dafny, HumanEval-Dafny, and DafnyBench, achieving consistent performance gains in all cases. Notably, on DafnyBench, the most challenging benchmark, Claude Sonnet 3.5 enhanced with DafnyPro achieves 86% correct proofs, a 16 pp improvement over the base model. We also fine-tune two Qwen models on training data derived from verification attempts by larger models enhanced with DafnyPro. Our 7B and 14B models achieve 68% and 70% correct proofs on DafnyBench, respectively, demonstrating that smaller models can maintain high verification accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detect, Explain, Escalate: Sustainable Dialogue Breakdown Management for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18839v4)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial capabilities in conversational AI applications, yet their susceptibility to dialogue breakdowns poses significant challenges to deployment reliability and user trust. This paper introduces a "Detect, Explain, Escalate" framework to manage dialogue breakdowns in LLM-powered agents, emphasizing resource-efficient operation. Our approach integrates two key strategies: (1) We fine-tune a compact 8B-parameter model, augmented with teacher-generated reasoning traces, which serves as an efficient real-time breakdown detector and explainer. This model demonstrates robust classification and calibration on English and Japanese dialogues, and generalizes to the BETOLD dataset, improving accuracy by 7% over its baseline. (2) We systematically evaluate frontier LLMs using advanced prompting (few-shot, chain-of-thought, analogical reasoning) for high-fidelity breakdown assessment. These are integrated into an "escalation" architecture where our efficient detector defers to larger models only when necessary, substantially reducing operational costs and computational overhead. Our fine-tuned model and prompting strategies achieve state-of-the-art performance on DBDC5 and strong results on BETOLD, outperforming specialized classifiers on DBDC5 and narrowing the performance gap to larger proprietary models. The proposed monitor-escalate pipeline reduces inference costs by 54%, providing a cost-effective and interpretable solution for robust conversational AI in high-impact domains. Code and models are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

That premise fails in two ways. It miscalibrates strategy because adversaries can obtain weaponizable capabilities with task-specific systems that use specialized data, algorithmic efficiency, and widely available hardware, while compute controls harden only a high-end perimeter. It also destabilizes regulation because, absent a settled definition of "AI weaponization," compute thresholds are easily renegotiated as domestic priorities shift, turning security policy into a proxy contest over industrial competitiveness. We analyze how the LLM Mirage took hold, propose an intent-and-capability definition of AI weaponization grounded in effects and international humanitarian law, and outline measurement infrastructure based on live benchmarks across the full AI Triad (data, algorithms, compute) for weaponization-relevant capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Our method, LELA, is a modular coarse-to-fine approach that leverages the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), and works with different target domains, knowledge bases and LLMs, without any fine-tuning phase. Our experiments across various entity linking settings show that LELA is highly competitive with fine-tuned approaches, and substantially outperforms the non-fine-tuned ones.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SimuAgent, an LLM-powered modeling and simulation agent tailored for Simulink. SimuAgent replaces verbose XML with a concise, dictionary-style Python representation, dramatically cutting token counts, improving interpretability, and enabling fast, in-process simulation. A lightweight plan-execute architecture, trained in two stages, equips the agent with both low-level tool skills and high-level design reasoning. To tackle sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, we propose Reflection-GRPO (ReGRPO), which augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-reflection traces that supply rich intermediate feedback, accelerating convergence and boosting robustness. Experiments on SimuBench, our newly released benchmark comprising 5300 multi-domain modeling tasks, show that a Qwen2.5-7B model fine-tuned with SimuAgent converges faster and achieves higher modeling accuracy than standard RL baselines, and even surpasses GPT-4o when evaluated with few-shot prompting on the same benchmark. Ablations confirm that the two-stage curriculum and abstract-reconstruct data augmentation further enhance generalization. SimuAgent trains and runs entirely on-premise with modest hardware, delivering a privacy-preserving, cost-effective solution for industrial model-driven engineering. SimuAgent bridges the gap between LLMs and graphical modeling environments, offering a practical solution for AI-assisted engineering design in industrial settings.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we present FALCONEye, a novel video agent based on a training-free, model-agnostic meta-architecture composed of a VLM and a Large Language Model (LLM). FALCONEye answers open-ended questions using an exploration-based search algorithm guided by calibrated confidence from the VLM's answers. We also introduce the FALCON-Bench benchmark, extending Question Answering problem to Video Answer Search-requiring models to return both the answer and its supporting temporal window for open-ended questions in hour-long videos. With just a 7B VLM and a lightweight LLM, FALCONEye outscores all open-source 7B VLMs and comparable agents in FALCON-Bench. It further demonstrates its generalization capability in MLVU benchmark with shorter videos and different tasks, surpassing GPT-4o on single-detail tasks while slashing inference cost by roughly an order of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

We find the opposite: judges are consistent, but not with each other; they are consistent with themselves. Across 3,240 evaluations (9 judges x 120 unique video x pack items x 3 independent runs), inter-judge agreement is near-zero (Krippendorff's α = 0.042). On two dimensions, judges disagree more than random noise would predict (α < 0). Yet this disagreement isn't chaos; it's structured. A classifier identifies which judge produced an evaluation with 77.1% accuracy from rubric scores alone, rising to 89.9% with disposition features. Within model families, the signal is even stronger: GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2 are distinguishable with 99.6% accuracy. We call this the reliability paradox: judges cannot agree on what constitutes quality, yet their disagreement patterns are so stable they function as fingerprints. Each judge implements a distinct, stable theory of quality: an "evaluative disposition" that shapes how it interprets any rubric. We characterize these dispositions along multiple axes: harshness/leniency, dimension emphasis, within-judge stability (ICC), and evidence behavior (receipt validity, semantic linkage via NLI, and shotgun index). The implication is stark: LLM judges are not interchangeable instruments measuring a shared construct. They are distinct measurement devices, each encoding its own implicit theory of quality. Averaging their scores produces a synthetic verdict that corresponds to no judge's actual values.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 figures, code and artifacts at : https://github.com/wajid-nasser/evaluative-fingerprints</p></details> |
| **[Token-Level LLM Collaboration via FusionRoute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05106v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strengths across diverse domains. However, achieving strong performance across these domains with a single general-purpose model typically requires scaling to sizes that are prohibitively expensive to train and deploy. On the other hand, while smaller domain-specialized models are much more efficient, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions. To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions. Empirically, across both Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families and diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, FusionRoute outperforms both sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and direct fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts on their respective tasks.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Can Confidence Estimates Decide When Chain-of-Thought Is Necessary for LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21007v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a common technique for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, extended reasoning is often unnecessary and substantially increases token usage. As such, a key question becomes how to optimally allocate compute to when reasoning is actually needed. We study this through confidence-gated CoT, where a model produces a direct answer and a confidence estimate to decide whether to invoke CoT. We present an evaluation framework together with the first systematic study of confidence signals for this decision. We evaluate four representative confidence measures and compare them with random gating and an oracle upper bound. Experiments across two model families and diverse reasoning tasks show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant reasoning. However, we also find that the utility of individual confidence measures is inconsistent across settings. Through our evaluation framework and analysis, our study provides practical guidance toward developing and evaluating models that selectively use CoT.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Talking with Tables for Better LLM Factual Data Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17189v4)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with requests related to information retrieval and data manipulation that frequently arise in real-world scenarios under multiple conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate that leveraging tabular structures in LLM interactions, is more effective than utilizing other structures for handling prevalent requests that operate over factual data. Through comprehensive evaluations across various scenarios and request types, we show that providing tabular structures yields a 40.29\% average performance gain along with better robustness and token efficiency. Through attention-value analysis, we discover that tables help LLMs better locate relevant information, explaining these improvements. Beyond tables and text, we evaluate whether (1) blending structuredness within text, such as providing templates or fixing the order of attributes, and (2) other representative structures, such as knowledge graphs and JSON are helpful. We observe that utilizing tables offers the best balance between efficiency and effectiveness. The method remains robust to task complexity and adapts to unstructured sources through text-to-table conversion. Overall, we highlight the untapped potential of tabular representations for future LLM applications.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

Automatically Measuring Information Potential in Text Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13691v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) converge towards similar capabilities, the key to advancing their performance lies in identifying and incorporating valuable new information sources. However, evaluating which text collections are worth the substantial investment required for digitization, preprocessing, and integration into LLM systems remains a significant challenge. We present a novel approach to this challenge: an automated pipeline that evaluates the potential information gain from text collections without requiring model training or fine-tuning. Our method generates multiple choice questions (MCQs) from texts and measures an LLM's performance both with and without access to the source material. The performance gap between these conditions serves as a proxy for the collection's information potential. We validate our approach using five strategically selected datasets: EPFL PhD manuscripts, a private collection of Venetian historical records, two sets of Wikipedia articles on related topics, and a synthetic baseline dataset. Our results demonstrate that this method effectively identifies collections containing valuable novel information, providing a practical tool for prioritizing data acquisition and integration efforts.</p></details> |  |

However, they remain difficult to obtain due to privacy constraints, data sensitivity, and the cost of building controlled collection environments such as testbeds and cyber ranges. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can operate as controlled knowledge-to-data engines for generating structured synthetic network traffic datasets suitable for IDS research. We propose a methodology that combines protocol documentation, attack semantics, and explicit statistical rules to condition LLMs without fine-tuning or access to raw samples. Using the AWID3 IEEE~802.11 benchmark as a demanding case study, we generate labeled datasets with four state-of-the-art LLMs and assess fidelity through a multi-level validation framework including global similarity metrics, per-feature distribution testing, structural comparison, and cross-domain classification. Results show that, under explicit constraints, LLM-generated datasets can closely approximate the statistical and structural characteristics of real network traffic, enabling gradient-boosting classifiers to achieve F1-scores up to 0.956 when evaluated on real samples. Overall, the findings suggest that constrained LLM-driven generation can facilitate on-demand IDS experimentation, providing a testbed-free, privacy-preserving alternative that overcomes the traditional bottlenecks of physical traffic collection and manual labeling.</p></details> |  |

However, mainstream Red Teaming methods rely on online generation and black-box output analysis. These approaches are not only costly but also suffer from feedback latency, making them unsuitable for agile diagnostics after training a new model. To address this, we propose N-GLARE (A Non-Generative, Latent Representation-Efficient LLM Safety Evaluator). N-GLARE operates entirely on the model's latent representations, bypassing the need for full text generation. It characterizes hidden layer dynamics by analyzing the APT (Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory) of latent representations and introducing the JSS (Jensen-Shannon Separability) metric. Experiments on over 40 models and 20 red teaming strategies demonstrate that the JSS metric exhibits high consistency with the safety rankings derived from Red Teaming. N-GLARE reproduces the discriminative trends of large-scale red-teaming tests at less than 1\% of the token cost and the runtime cost, providing an efficient output-free evaluation proxy for real-time diagnostics.</p></details> |  |

Cybersecurity programs often fail to equip graduates with skills demanded by the workforce, particularly concerning recent developments in cybersecurity, as curriculum design is costly and labor-intensive. To address this misalignment, we present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for automated design and analysis of cybersecurity curricula, called CurricuLLM. Our approach provides three key contributions: (1) automation of personalized curriculum design, (2) a data-driven pipeline aligned with industry demands, and (3) a comprehensive methodology for leveraging fine-tuned LLMs in curriculum development. CurricuLLM utilizes a two-tier approach consisting of PreprocessLM, which standardizes input data, and ClassifyLM, which assigns course content to nine Knowledge Areas in cybersecurity. We systematically evaluated multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) architectures and fine-tuning strategies, ultimately selecting the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model as ClassifyLM, fine-tuned on foundational cybersecurity concepts and workforce competencies. We are the first to validate our method with human experts who analyzed real-world cybersecurity curricula and frameworks, motivating that CurricuLLM is an efficient solution to replace labor-intensive curriculum analysis. Moreover, once course content has been classified, it can be integrated with established cybersecurity role-based weights, enabling alignment of the educational program with specific job roles, workforce categories, or general market needs. This lays the foundation for personalized, workforce-aligned cybersecurity curricula that prepare students for the evolving demands in cybersecurity.</p></details> |  |

We present ATLAS (Adaptive Trading with LLM AgentS), a unified multi-agent framework that integrates structured information from markets, news, and corporate fundamentals to support robust trading decisions. Within ATLAS, the central trading agent operates in an order-aware action space, ensuring that outputs correspond to executable market orders rather than abstract signals. The agent can incorporate feedback while trading using Adaptive-OPRO, a novel prompt-optimization technique that dynamically adapts the prompt by incorporating real-time, stochastic feedback, leading to increasing performance over time. Across regime-specific equity studies and multiple LLM families, Adaptive-OPRO consistently outperforms fixed prompts, while reflection-based feedback fails to provide systematic gains.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that dense models, when forced to fit conflicting value distributions, suffer from \textbf{Mean Collapse}, converging to a generic average that fails to represent diverse groups. We attribute this to \textbf{Cultural Sparsity}, where gradient interference prevents dense parameters from spanning distinct cultural modes. To resolve this, we propose \textbf{\textsc{CuMA}} (\textbf{Cu}ltural \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{A}dapters), a framework that frames alignment as a \textbf{conditional capacity separation} problem. By incorporating demographic-aware routing, \textsc{CuMA} internalizes a \textit{Latent Cultural Topology} to explicitly disentangle conflicting gradients into specialized expert subspaces. Extensive evaluations on WorldValuesBench, Community Alignment, and PRISM demonstrate that \textsc{CuMA} achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both dense baselines and semantic-only MoEs. Crucially, our analysis confirms that \textsc{CuMA} effectively mitigates mean collapse, preserving cultural diversity. Our code is available at https://github.com/Throll/CuMA.</p></details> |  |

Traditional machine-learning based approaches to performing this task require a large corpus of annotated data and lack the ability to easily incorporate domain specific information in the construction of the model. Therefore, creating a model for JERE is often labor intensive, time consuming, and elaboration intolerant. In this paper, we propose harnessing the capabilities of generative pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and the knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to perform JERE. We present a generic workflow for JERE using LLMs and ASP. The workflow is generic in the sense that it can be applied for JERE in any domain. It takes advantage of LLM's capability in natural language understanding in that it works directly with unannotated text. It exploits the elaboration tolerant feature of ASP in that no modification of its core program is required when additional domain specific knowledge, in the form of type specifications, is found and needs to be used. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed workflow through experiments with limited training data on three well-known benchmarks for JERE. The results of our experiments show that the LLM + ASP workflow is better than state-of-the-art JERE systems in several categories with only 10% of training data. It is able to achieve a 2.5 times (35% over 15%) improvement in the Relation Extraction task for the SciERC corpus, one of the most difficult benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2025, arXiv:2601.00047</p></details> |

To accelerate HLS DSE, graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly employed as surrogates for HLS tools to predict quality of results (QoR) metrics, while multi-objective optimization algorithms expedite the exploration. However, GNN-based prediction methods may not fully capture the rich semantic features inherent in behavioral descriptions, and conventional multi-objective optimization algorithms often do not explicitly account for the domain-specific knowledge regarding how pragma directives influence QoR. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the MPM-LLM4DSE framework, which incorporates a multimodal prediction model (MPM) that simultaneously fuses features from behavioral descriptions and control and data flow graphs. Furthermore, the framework employs a large language model (LLM) as an optimizer, accompanied by a tailored prompt engineering methodology. This methodology incorporates pragma impact analysis on QoR to guide the LLM in generating high-quality configurations (LLM4DSE). Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal predictive model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art work ProgSG by up to 10.25$\times$. Furthermore, in DSE tasks, the proposed LLM4DSE achieves an average performance gain of 39.90\% over prior methods, validating the effectiveness of our prompting methodology.

Newer solutions utilize advanced deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as well as Transformers, and domain-specific models for better layout analysis and accuracy across various sections over varied document types. Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized extraction pipelines at their core with sophisticated entity recognition and semantic comprehension to support complex contextual relationship mapping without direct programming specification. Visual Named Entity Recognition (NER) capabilities permit extraction from invoice images with greater contextual sensitivity and much higher accuracy rates than older approaches. Existing industry best practices utilize hybrid architectures that blend OCR technology and LLM for maximum scalability and minimal human intervention. This work introduces a holistic Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform combining OCR, deep learning, LLMs, and graph analytics to achieve unprecedented extraction quality and consistency.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Numerous studies have attempted to enhance this ability through preference optimization or reinforcement learning based on reward signals from LLM-as-a-Judge. However, existing evaluation models for instruction-following still possess many deficiencies, such as substantial costs and unreliable assessments. To this end, we propose IF-CRITIC, an LLM critic for fine-grained, efficient, and reliable instruction-following evaluation. We first develop a checklist generator to decompose instructions and generate constraint checklists. With the assistance of the checklists, we collect high-quality critique training data through a multi-stage critique filtering mechanism and employ a constraint-level preference optimization method to train IF-CRITIC. Extensive experiments show that the evaluation performance of IF-CRITIC can beat strong LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, including o4-mini and Gemini-3-Pro. With the reward signals provided by IF-CRITIC, LLMs can achieve substantial performance gains in instruction-following optimization under lower computational overhead compared to strong LLM critic baselines.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |
| **[RiskAtlas: Exposing Domain-Specific Risks in LLMs through Knowledge-Graph-Guided Harmful Prompt Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04740v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in specialized domains such as finance and healthcare, where they introduce unique safety risks. Domain-specific datasets of harmful prompts remain scarce and still largely rely on manual construction; public datasets mainly focus on explicit harmful prompts, which modern LLM defenses can often detect and refuse. In contrast, implicit harmful prompts-expressed through indirect domain knowledge-are harder to detect and better reflect real-world threats. We identify two challenges: transforming domain knowledge into actionable constraints and increasing the implicitness of generated harmful prompts. To address them, we propose an end-to-end framework that first performs knowledge-graph-guided harmful prompt generation to systematically produce domain-relevant prompts, and then applies dual-path obfuscation rewriting to convert explicit harmful prompts into implicit variants via direct and context-enhanced rewriting. This framework yields high-quality datasets combining strong domain relevance with implicitness, enabling more realistic red-teaming and advancing LLM safety research. We release our code and datasets at GitHub.</p></details> |  |

These models are not only computationally expensive but also data-hungry, requiring extensive labeled datasets for training. This creates a significant data challenge, as they overlook a rich, readily available data source: the LLM's own internal hidden states. To address this data and efficiency gap, we introduce SWIFT (Simple Weighted Intrinsic Feedback Technique), a novel and lightweight method that learns a reward function directly from the rich information embedded in LLM hidden states. Operating at the token embedding level, SWIFT employs simple linear layers to effectively distinguish between preferred and dispreferred generations, eliminating the need for computationally intensive text-based modeling. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms existing baselines (12.7% higher accuracy than EurusRM-7B on MATH dataset) while using less than 0.005% of their parameters. Its robust scalability, compatibility with certain closed-source models via logit access, and ability to combine with traditional reward models for additional performance highlight SWIFT's practical value and contribution to more efficient data-driven LLM post-training.

However, in real-world code-editing scenarios, reward distributions are often skewed with unpredictable noise, leading to distorted advantage computation and increased rollout outliers. To address this issue, we propose Group Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), which adaptively finds an interval with the highest SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) per prompt and uses the median of that interval as an adaptive Q to replace the group mean in advantage calculation to reduce noise further. This adaptive Q robustly handles rollout noise while remaining plug-and-play and efficient. We evaluate GAPO on nine instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-14B) using a collected large dataset of 51,844 real-world, history-aware code-editing tasks spanning 10 programming languages. GAPO yields up to 4.35 in-domain (ID) and 5.30 out-of-domain (OOD) exact-match improvements over GRPO and its variant DAPO, while achieving lower clipping ratios and higher GPU throughput.

While hallucination detection has recently emerged as a priority in English-centric benchmarks, low-to-medium resource languages such as Vietnamese remain inadequately covered by standardized evaluation frameworks. This paper introduces the DSC2025 ViHallu Challenge, the first large-scale shared task for detecting hallucinations in Vietnamese LLMs. We present the ViHallu dataset, comprising 10,000 annotated triplets of (context, prompt, response) samples systematically partitioned into three hallucination categories: no hallucination, intrinsic, and extrinsic hallucinations. The dataset incorporates three prompt types -- factual, noisy, and adversarial -- to stress-test model robustness. A total of 111 teams participated, with the best-performing system achieving a macro-F1 score of 84.80\%, compared to a baseline encoder-only score of 32.83\%, demonstrating that instruction-tuned LLMs with structured prompting and ensemble strategies substantially outperform generic architectures. However, the gap to perfect performance indicates that hallucination detection remains a challenging problem, particularly for intrinsic (contradiction-based) hallucinations. This work establishes a rigorous benchmark and explores a diverse range of detection methodologies, providing a foundation for future research into the trustworthiness and reliability of Vietnamese language AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prior-Informed Zeroth-Order Optimization with Adaptive Direction Alignment for Memory-Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04710v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, but the substantial memory overhead during backpropagation remains a critical bottleneck, especially as model scales grow. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization alleviates this issue by estimating gradients through forward passes and Gaussian sampling, avoiding the need for backpropagation. However, conventional ZO methods suffer from high variance in gradient estimation due to their reliance on random perturbations, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal performance. We propose a simple plug-and-play method that incorporates prior-informed perturbations to refine gradient estimation. Our method dynamically computes a guiding vector from Gaussian samples, which directs perturbations toward more informative directions, significantly accelerating convergence compared to standard ZO approaches. We further investigate a greedy perturbation strategy to explore the impact of prior knowledge on gradient estimation. Theoretically, we prove that our gradient estimator achieves stronger alignment with the true gradient direction, enhancing optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments across LLMs of varying scales and architectures demonstrate that our proposed method could seamlessly integrate into existing optimization methods, delivering faster convergence and superior performance. Notably, on the OPT-13B model, our method outperforms traditional ZO optimization across all 11 benchmark tasks and surpasses gradient-based baselines on 9 out of 11 tasks, establishing a robust balance between efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | 12pages, 6figures |

Existing methods, primarily relying on discrete input optimization (e.g., GCG), often suffer from high computational costs and generate high-perplexity prompts that are easily blocked by simple filters. To overcome these limitations, we propose Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a stealthy white-box attack that operates in the continuous latent space. Unlike previous approaches, LFJ constructs adversarial representations by mathematically fusing the hidden states of a harmful query with a thematically similar benign query, effectively masking malicious intent while retaining semantic drive. We further introduce a gradient-guided optimization strategy to balance attack success and computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations on Vicuna-7B, LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, Guanaco-7B, LLaMA-3-70B, and Mistral-7B-Instruct show that LFJ achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 94.01%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines like GCG and AutoDAN while avoiding detectable input artifacts. Furthermore, we identify that thematic similarity in the latent space is a critical vulnerability in current safety alignments. Finally, we propose a latent adversarial training defense that reduces LFJ's ASR by over 80% without compromising model utility.</p></details> |  |

However, as LLMs improve their problem-solving, any further improvement will potentially require high-quality solutions to difficult problems that are not available to humans. As a result, learning from unlabeled data is becoming increasingly attractive in the research community. Existing methods extract learning signal from a model's consistency, either by majority voting or by converting the model's internal confidence into reward. Although internal consistency metric such as entropy or self-certainty require no human intervention, as we show in this work, these are unreliable signals for large-scale and long-term training. To address the unreliability, we propose PRISM, a unified training framework that uses a Process Reward Model (PRM) to guide learning alongside model's internal confidence in the absence of ground-truth labels. We show that effectively combining PRM with self-certainty can lead to both stable training and better test-time performance, and also keep the model's internal confidence in check.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, MAS are typically distributed across different devices or environments, making them vulnerable to perturbations such as agent failures. While existing works have studied the adversarial attacks and corresponding defense strategies, they mainly focus on reactively detecting and mitigating attacks after they occur rather than proactively designing inherently resilient systems. In this work, we study the resilience of LLM-based MAS under perturbations and find that both the communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience. Motivated by these findings, we propose ResMAS: a two-stage framework for enhancing MAS resilience. First, we train a reward model to predict the MAS's resilience, based on which we train a topology generator to automatically design resilient topology for specific tasks through reinforcement learning. Second, we introduce a topology-aware prompt optimization method that refines each agent's prompt based on its connections and interactions with other agents. Extensive experiments across a range of tasks show that our approach substantially improves MAS resilience under various constraints. Moreover, our framework demonstrates strong generalization ability to new tasks and models, highlighting its potential for building resilient MASs.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing methods often rely solely on text semantics or incorporate collaborative signals in a limited manner, typically using only user or item embeddings. These methods struggle to handle multiple item embeddings representing user history, reverting to textual semantics and neglecting richer collaborative information. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective solution that projects user and item embeddings, learned from collaborative filtering, into the LLM token space via separate lightweight projector modules. A finetuned LLM then conditions on these projected embeddings alongside textual tokens to generate recommendations. Preliminary results show that this design effectively leverages structured user-item interaction data, improves recommendation performance over text-only LLM baselines, and offers a practical path for bridging traditional recommendation systems with modern LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Workshop at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing frameworks rely heavily on natural language reasoning to determine when tools can be invoked and whether their results should be committed, lacking formal guarantees for logical safety and verifiability. We present \textbf{ToolGate}, a forward execution framework that provides logical safety guarantees and verifiable state evolution for LLM tool calling. ToolGate maintains an explicit symbolic state space as a typed key-value mapping representing trusted world information throughout the reasoning process. Each tool is formalized as a Hoare-style contract consisting of a precondition and a postcondition, where the precondition gates tool invocation by checking whether the current state satisfies the required conditions, and the postcondition determines whether the tool's result can be committed to update the state through runtime verification. Our approach guarantees that the symbolic state evolves only through verified tool executions, preventing invalid or hallucinated results from corrupting the world representation. Experimental validation demonstrates that ToolGate significantly improves the reliability and verifiability of tool-augmented LLM systems while maintaining competitive performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. This work establishes a foundation for building more trustworthy and debuggable AI systems that integrate language models with external tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First version of ToolGate</p></details> |

In this context, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enabling natural-language interfaces for Internet of Things (IoT) control. However, existing LLM-based approaches suffer from unreliable and inefficient device control due to the non-deterministic nature of LLMs, high inference latency and cost, and limited personalization. To address these challenges, we present IoTGPT, an LLM-based smart home agent designed to execute IoT commands in a reliable, efficient, and personalized manner. Inspired by how humans manage complex tasks, IoTGPT decomposes user instructions into subtasks and memorizes them. By reusing learned subtasks, subsequent instructions can be processed more efficiently with fewer LLM calls, improving reliability and reducing both latency and cost. IoTGPT also supports fine-grained personalization by adapting individual subtasks to user preferences. Our evaluation demonstrates that IoTGPT outperforms baselines in accuracy, latency/cost, and personalization, while reducing user workload.</p></details> |  |

Traditional quantifier instantiation methods struggle because they lack semantic understanding of UF constraints, forcing them to search through unbounded solution spaces with limited guidance. We present AquaForte, a framework that leverages Large Language Models to provide semantic guidance for UF instantiation by generating instantiated candidates for function definitions that satisfy the constraints, thereby significantly reducing the search space and complexity for solvers. Our approach preprocesses formulas through constraint separation, uses structured prompts to extract mathematical reasoning from LLMs, and integrates the results with traditional SMT algorithms through adaptive instantiation. AquaForte maintains soundness through systematic validation: LLM-guided instantiations yielding SAT solve the original problem, while UNSAT results generate exclusion clauses for iterative refinement. Completeness is preserved by fallback to traditional solvers augmented with learned constraints. Experimental evaluation on SMT-COMP benchmarks demonstrates that AquaForte solves numerous instances where state-of-the-art solvers like Z3 and CVC5 timeout, with particular effectiveness on satisfiable formulas. Our work shows that LLMs can provide valuable mathematical intuition for symbolic reasoning, establishing a new paradigm for SMT constraint solving.</p></details> |  |

Defending against PI attacks faces two major issues: malicious instructions can be injected through diverse vectors, and injected instructions often lack clear semantic boundaries from the surrounding context, making them difficult to identify. To address these issues, we propose InstruCoT, a model enhancement method for PI defense that synthesizes diverse training data and employs instruction-level chain-of-thought fine-tuning, enabling LLMs to effectively identify and reject malicious instructions regardless of their source or position in the context. We evaluate InstruCoT across three critical dimensions: Behavior Deviation, Privacy Leakage, and Harmful Output. Experimental results across four LLMs demonstrate that InstruCoT significantly outperforms baselines in all dimensions while maintaining utility performance without degradation</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

Recent works have employed large language models (LLMs) as a text decoder to leverage their reasoning capabilities. However, prior approaches that project audio features into the LLM embedding space without considering cross-modal alignment fail to fully utilize these capabilities. To address this, we propose LAMB, an LLM-based audio captioning framework that bridges the modality gap between audio embeddings and the LLM text embedding space. LAMB incorporates a Cross-Modal Aligner that minimizes Cauchy-Schwarz divergence while maximizing mutual information, yielding tighter alignment between audio and text at both global and token levels. We further design a Two-Stream Adapter that extracts semantically enriched audio embeddings, thereby delivering richer information to the Cross-Modal Aligner. Finally, leveraging the aligned audio embeddings, a proposed Token Guide directly computes scores within the LLM text embedding space to steer the output logits of generated captions. Experimental results confirm that our framework strengthens the reasoning capabilities of the LLM decoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance on AudioCaps.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures; |

The proposed method integrates the encoder of the ASR model with the decoder of the LLMs, enabling simultaneous transcription and censorship tasks to prevent the exposure of harmful content. Instruction tuning of the LLM to mask hate-related words with specific tokens requires an annotated hate speech dataset, which is limited. We generate text samples using an LLM with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique guided by cultural context and examples and then convert them into speech samples using a text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, some of them contain non-hate speech samples with hate-related words, which degrades the censorship performance. This paper filters the samples which text classification models correctly label as hate content. By adjusting the threshold for the number of correct answer models, we can control the level of hate in the generated dataset, allowing us to train the LLMs through curriculum learning in a gradual manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a masking accuracy of 58.6\% for hate-related words, surpassing previous baselines. We also confirm that the curriculum training contributes to the efficiency of both transcription and censorship tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 17th Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA ASC 2025)</p></details> |

Isabellm works with any local LLM on Ollama and APIs such as Gemini CLI, and it is designed to run on consumer grade computers. The system combines a stepwise prover, which uses large language models to propose proof commands validated by Isabelle in a bounded search loop, with a higher-level proof planner that generates structured Isar outlines and attempts to fill and repair remaining gaps. The framework includes beam search for tactics, tactics reranker ML and RL models, premise selection with small transformer models, micro-RAG for Isar proofs built from AFP, and counter-example guided proof repair. All the code is implemented by GPT 4.1 - 5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5. Empirically, Isabellm can prove certain lemmas that defeat Isabelle's standard automation, including Sledgehammer, demonstrating the practical value of LLM-guided proof search. At the same time, we find that even state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT 5.2 Extended Thinking and Gemini 3 Pro struggle to reliably implement the intended fill-and-repair mechanisms with complex algorithmic designs, highlighting fundamental challenges in LLM code generation and reasoning. The code of Isabellm is available at https://github.com/zhehou/llm-isabelle</p></details> |  |

While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts. Overall, AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose a unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably, each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction, or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals. This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages,3 figures,5 tables</p></details> |

Due to privacy, security, and regulatory concerns, organizations often prefer on-premise deployment of LLMs. The ThaiLLM initiative aims to enhance Thai language capabilities in open-LLMs, enabling Thai industry to leverage advanced language models. However, organizations often face a trade-off between deploying multiple specialized models versus the prohibitive expense of training a single multi-capability model. To address this, we explore model merging as a resource-efficient alternative for developing high-performance, multi-capability LLMs. We present results from two key experiments: first, merging Qwen-8B with ThaiLLM-8B demonstrates how ThaiLLM-8B enhances Thai general capabilities, showing an uplift of M3 and M6 O-NET exams over the general instruction-following Qwen-8B. Second, we merge Qwen-8B with both ThaiLLM-8B and THaLLE-CFA-8B. This combination results in further improvements in performance across both general and financial domains, by demonstrating an uplift in both M3 and M6 O-NET, Flare-CFA, and Thai-IC benchmarks. The report showcases the viability of model merging for efficiently creating multi-capability LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We introduce LPFQA, a long-tail knowledge benchmark derived from authentic professional forum discussions, covering 7 academic and industrial domains with 430 curated tasks grounded in practical expertise. LPFQA evaluates specialized reasoning, domain-specific terminology understanding, and contextual interpretation, and adopts a hierarchical difficulty structure to ensure semantic clarity and uniquely identifiable answers. Experiments on over multiple mainstream LLMs reveal substantial performance gaps, particularly on tasks requiring deep domain reasoning, exposing limitations overlooked by existing benchmarks. Overall, LPFQA provides an authentic and discriminative evaluation framework that complements prior benchmarks and informs future LLM development.</p></details> |  |

However, current safety measures often fail to address implicit, domain-specific risks. To investigate this gap, we introduce a dataset of 3,000 annotated queries spanning education, finance, and management. Evaluations across 14 leading LLMs reveal a concerning vulnerability: an average jailbreak success rate of 57.8%. In response, we propose MENTOR, a metacognition-driven self-evolution framework. MENTOR first performs structured self-assessment through simulated critical thinking, such as perspective-taking and consequential reasoning to uncover latent model misalignments. These reflections are formalized into dynamic rule-based knowledge graphs that evolve with emerging risk patterns. To enforce these rules at inference time, we introduce activation steering, a method that directly modulates the model's internal representations to ensure compliance. Experiments demonstrate that MENTOR substantially reduces attack success rates across all tested domains and achieves risk analysis performance comparable to human experts. Our work offers a scalable and adaptive pathway toward robust domain-specific alignment of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, LLM-generated code still suffers from compilation and runtime errors. Existing offline preference optimization methods primarily focus on enhancing LLMs' coding abilities using pass/fail signals in the preference data, overlooking the deep-level error types in the failed codes. To address this, we propose Adaptively Progressive Preference Optimization (AP2O) for coding (i.e., AP2O-Coder), a method that guides LLMs adaptively and methodically to reduce code errors for code generation. Specifically, we construct an error notebook from failed codes and progressively optimize the LLM to correct errors type by type. Furthermore, we adaptively replay error types to tailor to the LLM's changing weaknesses throughout the training process. Through extensive experiments on both code and general LLMs (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek series) with parameters ranging from 0.5B to 34B, our AP2O-Coder improves code generation performance by up to 3% in pass@k while using less preference data.

To mitigate the high cost of expert annotation, prior work has commonly relied on LLM-generated feedback to train essay assessment models. However, such feedback is often incorporated without explicit quality validation, resulting in the propagation of noise in downstream applications. To address this limitation, we propose FeedEval, an LLM-based framework for evaluating LLM-generated essay feedback along three pedagogically grounded dimensions: specificity, helpfulness, and validity. FeedEval employs dimension-specialized LLM evaluators trained on datasets curated in this study to assess multiple feedback candidates and select high-quality feedback for downstream use. Experiments on the ASAP++ benchmark show that FeedEval closely aligns with human expert judgments and that essay scoring models trained with FeedEval-filtered high-quality feedback achieve superior scoring performance. Furthermore, revision experiments using small LLMs show that the high-quality feedback identified by FeedEval leads to more effective essay revisions.

To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel agentic method for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness, without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than large-scale, low-quality alternatives.</p></details> | 8 pages |

While this design enables autonomy, it also expands the attack surface for backdoor threats. Backdoor triggers injected into specific stages of an agent workflow can persist through multiple intermediate states and adversely influence downstream outputs. However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \textbf{planning attacks}, \textbf{memory attacks}, and \textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages. Building on this framework, we construct a standardized benchmark spanning four representative agent applications: \textbf{Agent QA}, \textbf{Agent Code}, \textbf{Agent Web}, and \textbf{Agent Drive}, covering both language-only and multimodal settings. Our empirical analysis shows that \textit{triggers implanted at a single stage can persist across multiple steps and propagate through intermediate states.} For instance, when using a GPT-based backbone, we observe trigger persistence in 43.58\% of planning attacks, 77.97\% of memory attacks, and 60.28\% of tool-stage attacks, highlighting the vulnerabilities of the agentic workflow itself to backdoor threats. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, our code and benchmark are publicly available at GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Here, we present Reasoning Over Space (ROS), a framework that utilizes geography as a vital decision variable within the reasoning process. ROS introduces a Hierarchical Spatial Semantic ID (SID) that discretizes coarse-to-fine locality and POI semantics into compositional tokens, and endows LLM with a three-stage Mobility Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm that models user personality, constructs an intent-aligned candidate space, and performs locality informed pruning. We further align the model with real world geography via spatial-guided Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on three widely used location-based social network (LBSN) datasets show that ROS achieves over 10% relative gains in hit rate over strongest LLM-based baselines and improves cross-city transfer, despite using a smaller backbone model.</p></details> |  |

It executed flawlessly, yet when asked "Why is completion rate 80%?", it returned metrics instead of causal explanation. The agent knew how to reason but we had not specified what to reason about. This reflects a gap: runtime reasoning frameworks (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought) have transformed LLM agents, but design-time specification--determining what domain knowledge agents need--remains under-explored. We propose 4D-ARE (4-Dimensional Attribution-Driven Agent Requirements Engineering), a preliminary methodology for specifying attribution-driven agents. The core insight: decision-makers seek attribution, not answers. Attribution concerns organize into four dimensions (Results -> Process -> Support -> Long-term), motivated by Pearl's causal hierarchy. The framework operationalizes through five layers producing artifacts that compile directly to system prompts. We demonstrate the methodology through an industrial pilot deployment in financial services. 4D-ARE addresses what agents should reason about, complementing runtime frameworks that address how. We hypothesize systematic specification amplifies the power of these foundational advances. This paper presents a methodological proposal with preliminary industrial validation; rigorous empirical evaluation is planned for future work.</p></details> | 39 pages, 11 tables |

Moreover, these approaches focus only on supportive neurons that correlate positively with task completion, while neglecting neurons with other roles-such as inhibitive roles-and misled neuron attribution due to fortuitous behaviors in LLMs (i.e., correctly answer the questions by chance rather than genuine understanding). To address these challenges, we propose NeuronLLM, a novel task-level LLM understanding framework that adopts the biological principle of functional antagonism for LLM neuron identification. The key insight is that task performance is jointly determined by neurons with two opposing roles: good neurons that facilitate task completion and bad neurons that inhibit it. NeuronLLM achieves a holistic modeling of neurons via contrastive learning of good and bad neurons, while leveraging augmented question sets to mitigate the fortuitous behaviors in LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on LLMs of different sizes and families show the superiority of NeuronLLM over existing methods in four NLP tasks, providing new insights into LLM functional organization.</p></details> |  |

Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks are limited to a fixed number of turns, susceptible to saturation and failing to account for users' interactive experience. In this work, we propose a novel framework featuring a three-layer tracking mechanism and a query synthesis agent to mimic sequential user behaviors. Grounded in Flow Theory, we introduce process-centric metrics and terminate a conversational evaluation only upon exhausting user patience. Leveraging this framework, we present EvolIF, an evolving benchmark covering 12 constraint groups. Our analysis reveals deficiencies in failure recovery and fine-grained instruction following, with performance stratification becoming evident as conversational depth increases. GPT-5 demonstrates the most sustained resilience, maintaining a 66.40% robustness score, outperforming Gemini-3-Pro by 5.59%, while other models lag behind.

However, existing approaches for ACD, such as deep reinforcement learning (RL), often face difficult exploration in complex networks with large decision/state spaces and thus require an expensive amount of samples. Inspired by the need to learn sample-efficient defense policies, we frame ACD in CAGE Challenge 4 (CAGE-4 / CC4) as a context-based partially observable Markov decision problem and propose a planning-centric defense policy based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It explicitly models the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in ACD and uses statistical sampling to guide exploration and decision making. We make novel use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to embed observations from the network as attributed graphs, to enable permutation-invariant reasoning over hosts and their relationships. To make our solution practical in complex search spaces, we guide MCTS with learned graph embeddings and priors over graph-edit actions, combining model-free generalization and policy distillation with look-ahead planning. We evaluate the resulting agent on CC4 scenarios involving diverse network structures and adversary behaviors, and show that our search-guided, graph-embedding-based planning improves defense reward and robustness relative to state-of-the-art RL baselines.</p></details> |  |

Existing works using this technique have shown great success using temporal graph neural networks and skip-gram-based approaches on random walks. However, random walk-based approaches are unable to incorporate rich edge data, while the GNN-based approaches require large amounts of memory to train. In this work, we propose extending the original insight from random walk-based skip-grams--that random walks through a graph are analogous to sentences in a corpus--to the more modern transformer-based foundation models. Using language models that take advantage of GPU optimizations, we can quickly train a graph foundation model to predict missing tokens in random walks through a network of computers. The graph foundation model is then finetuned for link prediction and used as a network anomaly detector. This new approach allows us to combine the efficiency of random walk-based methods and the rich semantic representation of deep learning methods. This system, which we call CyberGFM, achieved state-of-the-art results on three widely used network anomaly detection datasets, delivering a up to 2$\times$ improvement in average precision. We found that CyberGFM outperforms all prior works in unsupervised link prediction for network anomaly detection, using the same number of parameters, and with equal or better efficiency than the previous best approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 11 figures; 8 tables</p></details> |

Although biomedical research benefits from extensive datasets and established benchmarks, agrochemical data remain scarce, particularly with respect to species-specific toxicity. This work focuses on ApisTox, the most comprehensive dataset of experimentally validated chemical toxicity to the honey bee (\textit{Apis mellifera}), an ecologically vital pollinator. The primary goal of this study was to determine the suitability of diverse machine learning approaches for modeling such toxicity, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, and graph neural networks, as well as pretrained models. Comparative analysis with medicinal datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark reveals that ApisTox represents a distinct chemical space. Performance degradation on non-medicinal datasets, such as \mbox{ApisTox}, demonstrates their limited generalizability of current state-of-the-art algorithms trained solely on biomedical data. Our study highlights the need for more diverse datasets and for targeted model development geared toward the agrochemical domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Heterogeneous Graph Learning via Heterogeneous-aware Orthogonal Prototype Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05537v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks(HGNNs) have advanced mainly through better encoders, yet their decoding/projection stage still relies on a single shared linear head, assuming it can map rich node embeddings to labels. We call this the Linear Projection Bottleneck: in heterogeneous graphs, contextual diversity and long-tail shifts make a global head miss fine semantics, overfit hub nodes, and underserve tail nodes. While Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) could help, naively applying it clashes with structural imbalance and risks expert collapse. We propose a Heterogeneous-aware Orthogonal Prototype Experts framework named HOPE, a plug-and-play replacement for the standard prediction head. HOPE uses learnable prototype-based routing to assign instances to experts by similarity, letting expert usage follow the natural long-tail distribution, and adds expert orthogonalization to encourage diversity and prevent collapse. Experiments on four real datasets show consistent gains across SOTA HGNN backbones with minimal overhead.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN)-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to coordinate connected vehicles for emergency corridor formation. Our approach uses a high-level planner for global strategy and low-level controllers for trajectory execution, utilizing graph attention networks to scale with variable agent counts. Trained via Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), the system reduces emergency vehicle travel time by 28.3% compared to baselines and 44.6% compared to uncoordinated traffic in simulations. The design achieves near-zero collision rates (0.3%) while maintaining 81% of background traffic efficiency. Ablation and generalization studies confirm the framework's robustness across diverse scenarios. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining GNNs with hierarchical learning for intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 Pa...</summary><p>16 Pages, 5 Figures, 9 Tables, submitted to IEEE TITS</p></details> |

This paper introduces Grasp the Graph 2.0 (GtG 2.0) method, a lightweight yet highly effective hypothesis-and-test robotics grasping framework which leverages an ensemble of Graph Neural Networks for efficient geometric reasoning from point cloud data. Building on the success of GtG 1.0, which demonstrated the potential of Graph Neural Networks for grasp detection but was limited by assumptions of complete, noise-free point clouds and 4-Dof grasping, GtG 2.0 employs a conventional Grasp Pose Generator to efficiently produce 7-Dof grasp candidates. Candidates are assessed with an ensemble Graph Neural Network model which includes points within the gripper jaws (inside points) and surrounding contextual points (outside points). This improved representation boosts grasp detection performance over previous methods using the same generator. GtG 2.0 shows up to a 35% improvement in Average Precision on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark compared to hypothesis-and-test and Graph Neural Network-based methods, ranking it among the top three frameworks. Experiments with a 3-Dof Delta Parallel robot and Kinect-v1 camera show a success rate of 91% and a clutter completion rate of 100%, demonstrating its flexibility and reliability.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[DynaSTy: A Framework for SpatioTemporal Node Attribute Prediction in Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05391v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multistep forecasting of node-level attributes on dynamic graphs is critical for applications ranging from financial trust networks to biological networks. Existing spatiotemporal graph neural networks typically assume a static adjacency matrix. In this work, we propose an end-to-end dynamic edge-biased spatiotemporal model that ingests a multi-dimensional timeseries of node attributes and a timeseries of adjacency matrices, to predict multiple future steps of node attributes. At each time step, our transformer-based model injects the given adjacency as an adaptable attention bias, allowing the model to focus on relevant neighbors as the graph evolves. We further deploy a masked node-time pretraining objective that primes the encoder to reconstruct missing features, and train with scheduled sampling and a horizon-weighted loss to mitigate compounding error over long horizons. Unlike prior work, our model accommodates dynamic graphs that vary across input samples, enabling forecasting in multi-system settings such as brain networks across different subjects, financial systems in different contexts, or evolving social systems. Empirical results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).</p></details> |  |
| **[Belief Is All You Need: Modeling Narrative Archetypes in Conspiratorial Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10105v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded within digital communication ecosystems, yet its structure and spread remain difficult to study. This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features. Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Algorithmic Reasoning for Approximate $k$-Coloring with Recursive Warm Starts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05137v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node coloring is the task of assigning colors to the nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color, while using as few colors as possible. It is the most widely studied instance of graph coloring and of central importance in graph theory; major results include the Four Color Theorem and work on the Hadwiger-Nelson Problem. As an abstraction of classical combinatorial optimization tasks, such as scheduling and resource allocation, it is also rich in practical applications. Here, we focus on a relaxed version, approximate $k$-coloring, which is the task of assigning at most $k$ colors to the nodes of a graph such that the number of edges whose vertices have the same color is approximately minimized. While classical approaches leverage mathematical programming or SAT solvers, recent studies have explored the use of machine learning. We follow this route and explore the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for node coloring. We first present an optimized differentiable algorithm that improves a prior approach by Schuetz et al. with orthogonal node feature initialization and a loss function that penalizes conflicting edges more heavily when their endpoints have higher degree; the latter inspired by the classical result that a graph is $k$-colorable if and only if its $k$-core is $k$-colorable. Next, we introduce a lightweight greedy local search algorithm and show that it may be improved by recursively computing a $(k-1)$-coloring to use as a warm start. We then show that applying such recursive warm starts to the GNN approach leads to further improvements. Numerical experiments on a range of different graph structures show that while the local search algorithms perform best on small inputs, the GNN exhibits superior performance at scale. The recursive warm start may be of independent interest beyond graph coloring for local search methods for combinatorial optimization.</p></details> | 33 pages, 10 figures |

One key challenge in enhancing graph transformers is strengthening the discriminative power of distinguishing isomorphisms of graphs, which plays a crucial role in boosting their predictive performances. To address this challenge, we introduce 'Topology-Informed Graph Transformer (TIGT)', a novel transformer enhancing both discriminative power in detecting graph isomorphisms and the overall performance of Graph Transformers. TIGT consists of four components: A topological positional embedding layer using non-isomorphic universal covers based on cyclic subgraphs of graphs to ensure unique graph representation: A dual-path message-passing layer to explicitly encode topological characteristics throughout the encoder layers: A global attention mechanism: And a graph information layer to recalibrate channel-wise graph features for better feature representation. TIGT outperforms previous Graph Transformers in classifying synthetic dataset aimed at distinguishing isomorphism classes of graphs. Additionally, mathematical analysis and empirical evaluations highlight our model's competitive edge over state-of-the-art Graph Transformers across various benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Geometry-grounded Representation Learning and Generative Modeling Workshop (GRaM) at ICML 2024</p></details> |

Existing studies mostly address relatively benign scenarios, namely benchmark datasets with (a) high-dimensional but sparse node features and (b) incomplete data generated under Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) mechanisms. For (a), we theoretically prove that high sparsity substantially limits the information loss caused by missingness, making all models appear robust and preventing a meaningful comparison of their performance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce one synthetic and three real-world datasets with dense, semantically meaningful features. For (b), we move beyond MCAR and design evaluation protocols with more realistic missingness mechanisms. Moreover, we provide a theoretical background to state explicit assumptions on the missingness process and analyze their implications for different methods. Building on this analysis, we propose GNNmim, a simple yet effective baseline for node classification with incomplete feature data. Experiments show that GNNmim is competitive with respect to specialized architectures across diverse datasets and missingness regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parallelizing Node-Level Explainability in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04807v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, by exploiting the structural information in graph-structured data. However, in node classification, computing node-level explainability becomes extremely time-consuming as the size of the graph increases, while batching strategies often degrade explanation quality. This paper introduces a novel approach to parallelizing node-level explainability in GNNs through graph partitioning. By decomposing the graph into disjoint subgraphs, we enable parallel computation of explainability for node neighbors, significantly improving the scalability and efficiency without affecting the correctness of the results, provided sufficient memory is available. For scenarios where memory is limited, we further propose a dropout-based reconstruction mechanism that offers a controllable trade-off between memory usage and explanation fidelity. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial speedups, enabling scalable and transparent explainability for large-scale GNN models.</p></details> |  |

To accelerate HLS DSE, graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly employed as surrogates for HLS tools to predict quality of results (QoR) metrics, while multi-objective optimization algorithms expedite the exploration. However, GNN-based prediction methods may not fully capture the rich semantic features inherent in behavioral descriptions, and conventional multi-objective optimization algorithms often do not explicitly account for the domain-specific knowledge regarding how pragma directives influence QoR. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the MPM-LLM4DSE framework, which incorporates a multimodal prediction model (MPM) that simultaneously fuses features from behavioral descriptions and control and data flow graphs. Furthermore, the framework employs a large language model (LLM) as an optimizer, accompanied by a tailored prompt engineering methodology. This methodology incorporates pragma impact analysis on QoR to guide the LLM in generating high-quality configurations (LLM4DSE). Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal predictive model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art work ProgSG by up to 10.25$\times$. Furthermore, in DSE tasks, the proposed LLM4DSE achieves an average performance gain of 39.90\% over prior methods, validating the effectiveness of our prompting methodology.

However, concerns have arisen about GNNs potentially generating unfair decisions for underprivileged groups or individuals when lacking fairness constraints. This work addresses this issue by introducing GraphGini, a novel approach that incorporates the Gini coefficient to enhance both individual and group fairness within the GNN framework. We rigorously establish that the Gini coefficient offers greater robustness and promotes equal opportunity among GNN outcomes, advantages not afforded by the prevailing Lipschitz constant methodology. Additionally, we employ the Nash social welfare program to ensure our solution yields a Pareto optimal distribution of group fairness. Extensive experimentation on real-world datasets demonstrates GraphGini's efficacy in significantly improving individual fairness compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining utility and group fairness.</p></details> |  |

Existing training frameworks fail to overlap these stages, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. This paper proposes MQ-GNN, a multi-queue pipelined framework that maximizes training efficiency by interleaving GNN training stages and optimizing resource utilization. MQ-GNN introduces Ready-to-Update Asynchronous Consistent Model (RaCoM), which enables asynchronous gradient sharing and model updates while ensuring global consistency through adaptive periodic synchronization. Additionally, it employs global neighbor sampling with caching to reduce data transfer overhead and an adaptive queue-sizing strategy to balance computation and memory efficiency. Experiments on four large-scale datasets and ten baseline models demonstrate that MQ-GNN achieves up to \boldmath $\bm{4.6\,\times}$ faster training time and 30% improved GPU utilization while maintaining competitive accuracy. These results establish MQ-GNN as a scalable and efficient solution for multi-GPU GNN training.</p></details> | IEEE Access 2025 |
| **[A zone-based training approach for last-mile routing using Graph Neural Networks and Pointer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04705v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid e-commerce growth has pushed last-mile delivery networks to their limits, where small routing gains translate into lower costs, faster service, and fewer emissions. Classical heuristics struggle to adapt when travel times are highly asymmetric (e.g., one-way streets, congestion). A deep learning-based approach to the last-mile routing problem is presented to generate geographical zones composed of stop sequences to minimize last-mile delivery times. The presented approach is an encoder-decoder architecture. Each route is represented as a complete directed graph whose nodes are stops and whose edge weights are asymmetric travel times. A Graph Neural Network encoder produces node embeddings that captures the spatial relationships between stops. A Pointer Network decoder then takes the embeddings and the route's start node to sequentially select the next stops, assigning a probability to each unvisited node as the next destination. Cells of a Discrete Global Grid System which contain route stops in the training data are obtained and clustered to generate geographical zones of similar size in which the process of training and inference are divided. Subsequently, a different instance of the model is trained per zone only considering the stops of the training routes which are included in that zone. This approach is evaluated using the Los Angeles routes from the 2021 Amazon Last Mile Routing Challenge. Results from general and zone-based training are compared, showing a reduction in the average predicted route length in the zone-based training compared to the general training. The performance improvement of the zone-based approach becomes more pronounced as the number of stops per route increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in SMF 2026. 8 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[A Method for Constructing a Digital Transformation Driving Mechanism Based on Semantic Understanding of Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04696v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the process of digital transformation, enterprises are faced with problems such as insufficient semantic understanding of unstructured data and lack of intelligent decision-making basis in driving mechanisms. This study proposes a method that combines a large language model (LLM) and a knowledge graph. First, a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is used to perform entity recognition and relationship extraction on multi-source heterogeneous texts, and GPT-4 is used to generate semantically enhanced vector representations; secondly, a two-layer graph neural network (GNN) architecture is designed to fuse the semantic vectors output by LLM with business metadata to construct a dynamic and scalable enterprise knowledge graph; then reinforcement learning is introduced to optimize decision path generation, and the reward function is used to drive the mechanism iteration. In the case of the manufacturing industry, this mechanism reduced the response time for equipment failure scenarios from 7.8 hours to 3.7 hours, the F1 value reached 94.3%, and the compensation for decision errors in the annual digital transformation cost decreased by 45.3%. This method significantly enhances the intelligence level and execution efficiency of the digital transformation driving mechanism by integrating large model semantic understanding with structured knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Graph Representations with Neighborhood-Contextualized Message-Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11046v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become an indispensable tool for analyzing relational data. Classical GNNs are broadly classified into three variants: convolutional, attentional, and message-passing. While the standard message-passing variant is expressive, its typical pair-wise messages only consider the features of the center node and each neighboring node individually. This design fails to incorporate contextual information contained within the broader local neighborhood, potentially hindering its ability to learn complex relationships within the entire set of neighboring nodes. To address this limitation, this work first formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, rooted in a key property of the attentional variant. This then serves as the foundation for generalizing the message-passing variant to the proposed neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework. To demonstrate its utility, a simple, practical, and efficient method to parametrize and operationalize NCMP is presented, leading to the development of the proposed Soft-Isomorphic Neighborhood-Contextualized Graph Convolution Network (SINC-GCN). Across a diverse set of synthetic and benchmark GNN datasets, SINC-GCN demonstrates competitive performance against baseline GNN models, highlighting its expressivity and efficiency. Notably, it also delivers substantial and statistically significant performance gains in graph property prediction tasks, further underscoring the distinctive utility of neighborhood-contextualization. Overall, the paper lays the foundation for the NCMP framework as a practical path toward enhancing the graph representational power of classical GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A General Neural Backbone for Mixed-Integer Linear Optimization via Dual Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04509v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), a widely used modeling framework for combinatorial optimization, are central to many scientific and engineering applications, yet remains computationally challenging at scale. Recent advances in deep learning address this challenge by representing MILP instances as variable-constraint bipartite graphs and applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to extract latent structural patterns and enhance solver efficiency. However, this architecture is inherently limited by the local-oriented mechanism, leading to restricted representation power and hindering neural approaches for MILP. Here we present an attention-driven neural architecture that learns expressive representations beyond the pure graph view. A dual-attention mechanism is designed to perform parallel self- and cross-attention over variables and constraints, enabling global information exchange and deeper representation learning. We apply this general backbone to various downstream tasks at the instance level, element level, and solving state level. Extensive experiments across widely used benchmarks show consistent improvements of our approach over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting attention-based neural architectures as a powerful foundation for learning-enhanced mixed-integer linear optimization.</p></details> |  |

A prominent approach is to perturb the message-passing process, which forms the core of most GNN architectures. However, existing methods typically incur a privacy cost that grows linearly with the number of layers (e.g., GAP published in Usenix Security'23), ultimately requiring excessive noise to maintain a reasonable privacy level. This limitation becomes particularly problematic when multi-layer GNNs, which have shown better performance than one-layer GNN, are used to process graph data with sensitive information. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the privacy budget converges with respect to the number of layers by applying privacy amplification techniques to the message-passing process, exploiting the contractive properties inherent to standard GNN operations. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a simple yet effective Contractive Graph Layer (CGL) that ensures the contractiveness required for theoretical guarantees while preserving model utility. Our framework, CARIBOU, supports both training and inference, equipped with a contractive aggregation module, a privacy allocation module, and a privacy auditing module. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CARIBOU significantly improves the privacy-utility trade-off and achieves superior performance in privacy auditing tasks.</p></details> | 31 pages |
| **[Graph Integrated Transformers for Community Detection in Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04367v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Community detection is crucial for applications like targeted marketing and recommendation systems. Traditional methods rely on network structure, and embedding-based models integrate semantic information. However, there is a challenge when a model leverages local and global information from complex structures like social networks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers have shown superior performance in capturing local and global relationships. In this paper, We propose Graph Integrated Transformer for Community Detection (GIT-CD), a hybrid model combining GNNs and Transformer-based attention mechanisms to enhance community detection in social networks.

In this context, Graph Neural Networks are a promising solution due to their ability to learn from graph-structured data. Combined with Reinforcement Learning, they can be used as control approaches to determine remedial actions. This review analyses how Graph Reinforcement Learning can improve representation learning and decision-making in power grid applications, particularly transmission and distribution grids. We analyze the reviewed approaches in terms of the graph structure, the Graph Neural Network architecture, and the Reinforcement Learning approach. Although Graph Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated adaptability to unpredictable events and noisy data, its current stage is primarily proof-of-concept, and it is not yet deployable to real-world applications. We highlight the open challenges and limitations for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Energy & AI, in-press</p></details> |
| **[Dual-Attention Heterogeneous GNN for Multi-robot Collaborative Area Search via Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03686v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-robot collaborative area search, a key challenge is to dynamically balance the two objectives of exploring unknown areas and covering specific targets to be rescued. Existing methods are often constrained by homogeneous graph representations, thus failing to model and balance these distinct tasks. To address this problem, we propose a Dual-Attention Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (DA-HGNN) trained using deep reinforcement learning. Our method constructs a heterogeneous graph that incorporates three entity types: robot nodes, frontier nodes, and interesting nodes, as well as their historical states. The dual-attention mechanism comprises the relational-aware attention and type-aware attention operations. The relational-aware attention captures the complex spatio-temporal relationships among robots and candidate goals. Building on this relational-aware heterogeneous graph, the type-aware attention separately computes the relevance between robots and each goal type (frontiers vs. points of interest), thereby decoupling the exploration and coverage from the unified tasks. Extensive experiments conducted in interactive 3D scenarios within the iGibson simulator, leveraging the Gibson and MatterPort3D datasets, validate the superior scalability and generalization capability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods that focus on sentence arrangement, textual consistency, and question answering are inadequate in addressing this issue. To bridge this gap, we introduce InsertGNN, which conceptualizes the problem as a graph and employs a hierarchical Graph Neural Network (GNN) to comprehend the interplay between sentences. Our approach was rigorously evaluated on a TOEFL dataset, and its efficacy was further validated on the expansive arXiv dataset using cross-domain learning. Thorough experimentation unequivocally establishes InsertGNN's superiority over all comparative benchmarks, achieving an impressive 70% accuracy, a performance on par with average human test scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering the Representation Bottleneck of Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07266v5)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) rely mainly on the message-passing paradigm to propagate node features and build interactions, and different graph learning problems require different ranges of node interactions. In this work, we explore the capacity of GNNs to capture node interactions under contexts of different complexities. We discover that GNNs usually fail to capture the most informative kinds of interaction styles for diverse graph learning tasks, and thus name this phenomenon GNNs' representation bottleneck. As a response, we demonstrate that the inductive bias introduced by existing graph construction mechanisms can result in this representation bottleneck, \emph{i.e.}, preventing GNNs from learning interactions of the most appropriate complexity. To address that limitation, we propose a novel graph rewiring approach based on interaction patterns learned by GNNs to dynamically adjust each node's receptive fields. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets prove the effectiveness of our algorithm in alleviating the representation bottleneck and its superiority in enhancing the performance of GNNs over state-of-the-art graph rewiring baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inductive Graph Representation Learning with Quantum Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24111v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) offer a promising approach to combining quantum computing with graph-structured data processing. While classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are scalable and robust, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum circuit designs, limiting their applicability to diverse real-world problems. To address this, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by GraphSAGE, using quantum models as aggregators. We integrate inductive representation learning techniques with parameterized quantum convolutional and pooling layers, bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer is flexible, allowing tailored designs for specific tasks. Benchmarked on a node regression task with the QM9 dataset, our framework, using a single minimal circuit for all aggregation steps, handles molecules with varying numbers of atoms without changing qubits or circuit architecture. While classical GNNs achieve higher training performance, our quantum approach remains competitive and often shows stronger generalization as molecular complexity increases. We also observe faster learning in early training epochs. To mitigate trainability limitations of a single-circuit setup, we extend the framework with multiple quantum aggregators on QM9. Assigning distinct circuits to each hop substantially improves training performance across all cases. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus as qubit numbers increase, suggesting that the proposed model can scale to larger, more complex graph-based problems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.</p></details> |  |

Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing spatial-temporal dependencies in sensor data, their black-box nature and the limited work on graph-based explainable models for water networks hinder practical adoption. We propose an explainable GNN framework that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks. After benchmarking several GNN architectures, we selected the generalized graph convolution network (GENConv) for its superior performance and developed a fuzzy-enhanced variant that offers intuitive explanations for classified leak locations. Our fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for detection and 0.814 for localization, slightly below the crisp GENConv 0.938 and 0.858, respectively. Yet it compensates by providing spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations. By striking the right balance between precision and explainability, the proposed fuzzy network could enable hydraulic engineers to validate predicted leak locations, conserve human resources, and optimize maintenance strategies.

| **[Flow Matching and Diffusion Models via PointNet for Generating Fluid Fields on Irregular Geometries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03030v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present two novel generative geometric deep learning frameworks, termed Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet, for predicting fluid flow variables on irregular geometries by incorporating PointNet into flow matching and diffusion models, respectively. In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Large-Scale Analysis on the Use of Arrival Time Prediction for Automated Shuttle Services in the Real World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05322v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban mobility is on the cusp of transformation with the emergence of shared, connected, and cooperative automated vehicles. Yet, for them to be accepted by customers, trust in their punctuality is vital. Many pilot initiatives operate without a fixed schedule, enhancing the importance of reliable arrival time (AT) predictions. This study presents an AT prediction system for automated shuttles, utilizing separate models for dwell and running time predictions, validated on real-world data from six cities. Alongside established methods such as XGBoost, we explore the benefits of leveraging spatial correlations using graph neural networks (GNN). To accurately handle the case of a shuttle bypassing a stop, we propose a hierarchical model combining a random forest classifier and a GNN. The results for the final AT prediction are promising, showing low errors even when predicting several stops ahead. Yet, no single model emerges as universally superior, and we provide insights into the characteristics of pilot sites that influence the model selection process and prediction performance. Finally, we identify dwell time prediction as the key determinant in overall AT prediction accuracy when automated shuttles are deployed in low-traffic areas or under regulatory speed limits. Our meta-analysis across six pilot sites in different cities provides insights into the current state of autonomous public transport prediction models and paves the way for more data-informed decision-making as the field advances.</p></details> |  |

As the scale of real-world graphs has been continuously growing, a storage-based approach to GNN training has been studied, which leverages external storage (e.g., NVMe SSDs) to handle such web-scale graphs on a single machine. Although such storage-based GNN training methods have shown promising potential in large-scale GNN training, we observed that they suffer from a severe bottleneck in data preparation since they overlook a critical challenge: how to handle a large number of small storage I/Os. To address the challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel storage-based GNN training framework, named AGNES, that employs a method of block-wise storage I/O processing to fully utilize the I/O bandwidth of high-performance storage devices. Moreover, to further enhance the efficiency of each storage I/O, AGNES employs a simple yet effective strategy, hyperbatch-based processing based on the characteristics of real-world graphs. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world graphs reveal that AGNES consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art methods, by up to 4.1X faster than the best competitor.

Current approaches predominantly use visual saliency or historical gaze patterns, neglecting the role of spatial audio in guiding user attention. This paper presents a self-learning framework for detecting "surprising" auditory events -- moments that deviate from learned temporal expectations -- and demonstrates their utility for viewport prediction. The proposed architecture combines $SE(3)$-equivariant graph neural networks with recurrent temporal modeling, trained via a dual self-supervised objective. A key feature is the natural modeling of temporal attention decay: surprise is high at event onset but diminishes as the listener adapts. Experiments on the AVTrack360 dataset show that integrating audio surprise with visual cues reduces bitrate waste by up to 18% compared to visual-only methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, Under review</p></details> |

Such image manipulations can be produced using traditional image editing tools (known as "shallowfakes") or advanced artificial intelligence techniques ("deepfakes"). While numerous studies have focused on image manipulation localization on either shallowfake images or deepfake videos, few approaches address both cases. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a deep learning network to localize manipulations in both shallow- and deep-fake images, and proposed a solution for such purpose. To precisely differentiate between authentic and manipulated pixels, we leverage the Vision Mamba network to extract feature maps that clearly describe the boundaries between tampered and untouched regions. To further enhance this separation, we propose a novel Guided Graph Neural Network (G-GNN) module that amplifies the distinction between manipulated and authentic pixels. Our evaluation results show that our proposed method achieved higher inference accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for journal publication</p></details> |

Recent advances in Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) have shown promise in mitigating class imbalance with numeric interpolation; however, existing approaches largely rely on embedding-space arithmetic, which fails to capture the rich semantics inherent in text-attributed graphs. In this work, we propose our method, SaVe-TAG (Semantic-aware Vicinal Risk Minimization for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs), a novel VRM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform text-level interpolation, generating on-manifold, boundary-enriching synthetic samples for minority classes. To mitigate the risk of noisy generation, we introduce a confidence-based edge assignment mechanism that uses graph topology as a natural filter to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical justification for our method and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that our approach consistently outperforms both numeric interpolation and prior long-tailed node classification baselines. Our results highlight the importance of integrating semantic and structural signals for balanced and effective learning on text-attributed graphs.

We adapt Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (\mhc)~\citep{xie2025mhc}, recently proposed for Transformers, to graph neural networks. Our method, mHC-GNN, expands node representations across $n$ parallel streams and constrains stream-mixing matrices to the Birkhoff polytope via Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization. We prove that mHC-GNN exhibits exponentially slower over-smoothing (rate $(1-γ)^{L/n}$ vs.\ $(1-γ)^L$) and can distinguish graphs beyond 1-WL. Experiments on 10 datasets with 4 GNN architectures show consistent improvements. Depth experiments from 2 to 128 layers reveal that standard GNNs collapse to near-random performance beyond 16 layers, while mHC-GNN maintains over 74\% accuracy even at 128 layers, with improvements exceeding 50 percentage points at extreme depths. Ablations confirm that the manifold constraint is essential: removing it causes up to 82\% performance degradation.

| **[Quantized SO(3)-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Efficient Molecular Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02213v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying 3D graph neural networks (GNNs) that are equivariant to 3D rotations (the group SO(3)) on edge devices is challenging due to their high computational cost. This paper addresses the problem by compressing and accelerating an SO(3)-equivariant GNN using low-bit quantization techniques. Specifically, we introduce three innovations for quantized equivariant transformers: (1) a magnitude-direction decoupled quantization scheme that separately quantizes the norm and orientation of equivariant (vector) features, (2) a branch-separated quantization-aware training strategy that treats invariant and equivariant feature channels differently in an attention-based $SO(3)$-GNN, and (3) a robustness-enhancing attention normalization mechanism that stabilizes low-precision attention computations. Experiments on the QM9 and rMD17 molecular benchmarks demonstrate that our 8-bit models achieve accuracy on energy and force predictions comparable to full-precision baselines with markedly improved efficiency. We also conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component to maintain accuracy and equivariance under quantization, using the Local error of equivariance (LEE) metric. The proposed techniques enable the deployment of symmetry-aware GNNs in practical chemistry applications with 2.37--2.73x faster inference and 4x smaller model size, without sacrificing accuracy or physical symmetry.</p></details> |  |

The method is designed to guide the learning process through successive approximations, starting from reduced-order and full Stokes models, and progressively approaching the Navier--Stokes solution. To effectively capture both local and long-range dependencies in the velocity and pressure fields, we combine graph neural networks with Transformer and Mamba architectures. While Transformers achieve the highest accuracy, we show that Mamba can be successfully adapted to graph-structured data through an unsupervised node-ordering strategy. The Mamba approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining performance. Physical knowledge is embedded directly into the architecture through an encoding -- processing -- physics informed decoding pipeline. Derivatives are computed through algebraic operators constructed via the Weighted Least Squares method. The flexibility of these operators allows us not only to make the output obey the governing equations, but also to constrain selected hidden features to satisfy mass conservation. We introduce additional physical biases through an enriched graph convolution with the same differential operators describing the PDEs. Overall, we successfully guide the learning process by physical knowledge and fluid dynamics insights, leading to more regular and accurate predictions</p></details> |  |
| **[Focus on What Matters: Fisher-Guided Adaptive Multimodal Fusion for Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02438v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerability detection is a critical task for securing software systems and can be formulated as a binary classification problem: given a code snippet, determine whether it contains a vulnerability. Existing multimodal approaches typically fuse Natural Code Sequence (NCS) representations from pretrained language models with Code Property Graph (CPG) representations from graph neural networks, often under the implicit assumption that adding a modality necessarily yields extra information. In practice, sequence and graph representations can be redundant, and fluctuations in the quality of the graph modality can dilute the discriminative signal of the dominant modality. To address this, we propose TaCCS-DFA, a framework that introduces Fisher information as a geometric measure of how sensitive feature directions are to the classification decision, enabling task-oriented complementary fusion. TaCCS-DFA online estimates a low-rank principal Fisher subspace and restricts cross-modal attention to task-sensitive directions, thereby retrieving structural features from CPG that complement the sequence modality; meanwhile, an adaptive gating mechanism dynamically adjusts the contribution of the graph modality for each sample to suppress noise propagation. Our analysis shows that, under an isotropic perturbation assumption, the proposed mechanism admits a tighter risk bound than conventional full-spectrum attention. Experiments on BigVul, Devign, and ReVeal show that TaCCS-DFA achieves strong performance across multiple backbones. With CodeT5 as the backbone, TaCCS-DFA reaches an F1 score of 87.80\% on the highly imbalanced BigVul dataset, improving over a strong baseline Vul-LMGNNs by 6.3 percentage points while maintaining low calibration error and computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

The majority of the existing approaches leverage deep learning models. While these approaches are effective, the rationale behind their outputs is opaque. Recently, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches emerged to provide intuitive explanations to the output of HAR models. To the best of our knowledge, these approaches leverage classic deep models like CNNs or RNNs. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) proved to be effective for sensor-based HAR. However, existing approaches are not designed with explainability in mind. In this work, we propose the first explainable Graph Neural Network explicitly designed for smart home HAR. Our results on two public datasets show that this approach provides better explanations than state-of-the-art methods while also slightly improving the recognition rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Graph Neural Network Training, Defense and Hypergraph Clustering via Adversarial Robustness Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14738v11)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a highly effective neural network architecture for processing graph-structured data. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely solely on the features of the data as input, GNNs leverage both the graph structure, which represents the relationships between data points, and the feature matrix of the data to optimize their feature representation. This unique capability enables GNNs to achieve superior performance across various tasks. However, it also makes GNNs more susceptible to noise and adversarial attacks from both the graph structure and data features, which can significantly increase the training difficulty and degrade their performance. Similarly, a hypergraph is a highly complex structure, and partitioning a hypergraph is a challenging task. This paper leverages spectral adversarial robustness evaluation to effectively address key challenges in complex-graph algorithms. By using spectral adversarial robustness evaluation to distinguish robust nodes from non-robust ones and treating them differently, we propose a training-set construction strategy that improves the training quality of GNNs. In addition, we develop algorithms to enhance both the adversarial robustness of GNNs and the performance of hypergraph clustering. Experimental results show that this series of methods is highly effective.</p></details> |  |

Elections have been the canonical way by which modern democracy has operated since the 17th century. Nowadays, they regulate markets, provide an engine for modern recommender systems or peer-to-peer networks, and remain the main approach to represent democracy. However, a desirable universal voting rule that satisfies all hypothetical scenarios is still a challenging topic, and the design of these systems is at the forefront of mechanism design research. Automated mechanism design is a promising approach, and recent works have demonstrated that set-invariant architectures are uniquely suited to modelling electoral systems. However, various concerns prevent the direct application to real-world settings, such as robustness to strategic voting. In this paper, we generalise the expressive capability of learned voting rules, and combine improvements in neural network architecture with adversarial training to improve the resilience of voting rules while maximizing social welfare. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our method resolves critical limitations of prior work regarding learning voting rules by representing elections using bipartite graphs, and learning such voting rules using graph neural networks. We believe this opens new frontiers for applying machine learning to real-world elections.</p></details> |  |

However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |

However, existing graph neural network methods, though effective for small molecules, only model the single unit of polymers and fail to produce consistent vector representations for the true polymer structure with varying numbers of units. To address this challenge, we introduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer representations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their graph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree alignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and data perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal augmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning. GRIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both homopolymer and copolymer benchmarks, learning stable, repetition-invariant representations that generalize effectively to polymer chains of unseen sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Many existing graph neural networks either rely on a fixed adjacency structure or attempt to handle structural noise through regularization. In this work, we explicitly capture structural uncertainty by modeling a posterior distribution over signed adjacency matrices, allowing each edge to be positive, negative, or absent. We propose a sparse signed message passing network that is naturally robust to edge noise and heterophily, which can be interpreted from a Bayesian perspective. By combining (i) posterior marginalization over signed graph structures with (ii) sparse signed message aggregation, our approach offers a principled way to handle both edge noise and heterophily. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baseline models on heterophilic benchmarks under both synthetic and real-world structural noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Gaining Paths to Investment Success: Information-Driven LLM Graph Reasoning for Venture Capital Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23489v2)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most venture capital (VC) investments fail, while a few deliver outsized returns. Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes.

| **[Learning from Historical Activations in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01123v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various domains such as social networks, molecular chemistry, and more. A crucial component of GNNs is the pooling procedure, in which the node features calculated by the model are combined to form an informative final descriptor to be used for the downstream task. However, previous graph pooling schemes rely on the last GNN layer features as an input to the pooling or classifier layers, potentially under-utilizing important activations of previous layers produced during the forward pass of the model, which we regard as historical graph activations. This gap is particularly pronounced in cases where a node's representation can shift significantly over the course of many graph neural layers, and worsened by graph-specific challenges such as over-smoothing in deep architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce HISTOGRAPH, a novel two-stage attention-based final aggregation layer that first applies a unified layer-wise attention over intermediate activations, followed by node-wise attention. By modeling the evolution of node representations across layers, our HISTOGRAPH leverages both the activation history of nodes and the graph structure to refine features used for final prediction. Empirical results on multiple graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that HISTOGRAPH offers strong performance that consistently improves traditional techniques, with particularly strong robustness in deep GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Graph Neural Networks for Physiological Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling: A Novel Data Driven Approach to Drug Concentration Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22096v2)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a key tool in drug development for predicting drug concentration dynamics across organs. Traditional PBPK approaches rely on ordinary differential equations with simplifying assumptions that limit their ability to capture nonlinear and system-level physiological interactions. In this work, we investigate data-driven PBPK modeling using deep learning. We implement two baseline architectures -- a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network -- and propose a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (Dynamic GNN) that explicitly models inter-organ interactions through recurrent message passing on a physiological graph. Experiments on a multi-organ pharmacokinetic dataset show that the Dynamic GNN achieves the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 15.7% among all models, demonstrating improved relative accuracy despite slightly higher absolute error compared to the MLP baseline. The model attains an R2 of 0.9342 with more stable error behavior and better captures inter-organ pharmacokinetic relationships. These results highlight the importance of structure-aware modeling for PBPK applications and demonstrate that the proposed Dynamic GNN offers a scalable, equation-free alternative for data-driven pharmacokinetic prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frequent subgraph-based persistent homology for graph classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24917v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Persistent homology (PH) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting topological features. Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: A...</summary><p>v2: Author list updated to include previously omitted co-authors</p></details> |
| **[Traffic-Aware Optimal Taxi Placement Using Graph Neural Network-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00607v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of smart city transportation, efficient matching of taxi supply with passenger demand requires real-time integration of urban traffic network data and mobility patterns. Conventional taxi hotspot prediction models often rely solely on historical demand, overlooking dynamic influences such as traffic congestion, road incidents, and public events. This paper presents a traffic-aware, graph-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework for optimal taxi placement in metropolitan environments. The urban road network is modeled as a graph where intersections represent nodes, road segments serve as edges, and node attributes capture historical demand, event proximity, and real-time congestion scores obtained from live traffic APIs. Graph Neural Network (GNN) embeddings are employed to encode spatial-temporal dependencies within the traffic network, which are then used by a Q-learning agent to recommend optimal taxi hotspots. The reward mechanism jointly optimizes passenger waiting time, driver travel distance, and congestion avoidance. Experiments on a simulated Delhi taxi dataset, generated using real geospatial boundaries and historic ride-hailing request patterns, demonstrate that the proposed model reduced passenger waiting time by about 56% and reduced travel distance by 38% compared to baseline stochastic selection. The proposed approach is adaptable to multi-modal transport systems and can be integrated into smart city platforms for real-time urban mobility optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Minimum Weight Perfect Matching for Quantum Error Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00242v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realizing the full potential of quantum computation requires Quantum Error Correction (QEC). QEC reduces error rates by encoding logical information across redundant physical qubits, enabling errors to be detected and corrected. A common decoder used for this task is Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) a graph-based algorithm that relies on edge weights to identify the most likely error chains. In this work, we propose a data-driven decoder named Neural Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (NMWPM). Our decoder utilizes a hybrid architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract local syndrome features and Transformers to capture long-range global dependencies, which are then used to predict dynamic edge weights for the MWPM decoder. To facilitate training through the non-differentiable MWPM algorithm, we formulate a novel proxy loss function that enables end-to-end optimization. Our findings demonstrate significant performance reduction in the Logical Error Rate (LER) over standard baselines, highlighting the advantage of hybrid decoders that combine the predictive capabilities of neural networks with the algorithmic structure of classical matching.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMBWatch -- a Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network approach to detect Illicit Massage Business](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00075v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Illicit Massage Businesses (IMBs) are a covert and persistent form of organized exploitation that operate under the facade of legitimate wellness services while facilitating human trafficking, sexual exploitation, and coerced labor. Detecting IMBs is difficult due to encoded digital advertisements, frequent changes in personnel and locations, and the reuse of shared infrastructure such as phone numbers and addresses. Traditional approaches, including community tips and regulatory inspections, are largely reactive and ineffective at revealing the broader operational networks traffickers rely on. To address these challenges, we introduce IMBWatch, a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) framework for large-scale IMB detection. IMBWatch constructs dynamic graphs from open-source intelligence, including scraped online advertisements, business license records, and crowdsourced reviews. Nodes represent heterogeneous entities such as businesses, aliases, phone numbers, and locations, while edges capture spatio-temporal and relational patterns, including co-location, repeated phone usage, and synchronized advertising. The framework combines graph convolutional operations with temporal attention mechanisms to model the evolution of IMB networks over time and space, capturing patterns such as intercity worker movement, burner phone rotation, and coordinated advertising surges. Experiments on real-world datasets from multiple U.S. cities show that IMBWatch outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy and F1 scores. Beyond performance gains, IMBWatch offers improved interpretability, providing actionable insights to support proactive and targeted interventions. The framework is scalable, adaptable to other illicit domains, and released with anonymized data and open-source code to support reproducible research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI AISI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Perturbation Modeling Through Biomedical Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22251v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how small molecules perturb gene expression is essential for uncovering drug mechanisms, predicting off-target effects, and identifying repurposing opportunities. While prior deep learning frameworks have integrated multimodal embeddings into biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) and further improved these representations through graph neural network message-passing paradigms, these models have been applied to tasks such as link prediction and binary drug-disease association, rather than the task of gene perturbation, which may unveil more about mechanistic transcriptomic effects. To address this gap, we construct a merged biomedical graph that integrates (i) PrimeKG++, an augmentation of PrimeKG containing semantically rich embeddings for nodes with (ii) LINCS L1000 drug and cell line nodes, initialized with multimodal embeddings from foundation models such as MolFormerXL and BioBERT. Using this heterogeneous graph, we train a graph attention network (GAT) with a downstream prediction head that learns the delta expression profile of over 978 landmark genes for a given drug-cell pair. Our results show that our framework outperforms MLP baselines for differentially expressed genes (DEG) -- which predict the delta expression given a concatenated embedding of drug features, target features, and baseline cell expression -- under the scaffold and random splits. Ablation experiments with edge shuffling and node feature randomization further demonstrate that the edges provided by biomedical KGs enhance perturbation-level prediction. More broadly, our framework provides a path toward mechanistic drug modeling: moving beyond binary drug-disease association tasks to granular transcriptional effects of therapeutic intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Graph Neural Networks for Cognitive Task Classification in fMRI Connectomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24901v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cognitive task classification using machine learning plays a central role in decoding brain states from neuroimaging data. By integrating machine learning with brain network analysis, complex connectivity patterns can be extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging connectomes. This process transforms raw blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals into interpretable representations of cognitive processes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) further advance this paradigm by modeling brain regions as nodes and functional connections as edges, capturing topological dependencies and multi-scale interactions that are often missed by conventional approaches. Our proposed SpectralBrainGNN model, a spectral convolution framework based on graph Fourier transforms (GFT) computed via normalized Laplacian eigendecomposition. Experiments on the Human Connectome Project-Task (HCPTask) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.25\%. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/gnnplayground/SpectralBrainGNN to support reproducibility and future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spiking Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02401v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graphs or networks are usually heterogeneous, involving multiple types of nodes and relationships. Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) can effectively handle these diverse nodes and edges, capturing heterogeneous information within the graph, thus exhibiting outstanding performance. However, most methods of HGNNs usually involve complex structural designs, leading to problems such as high memory usage, long inference time, and extensive consumption of computing resources. These limitations pose certain challenges for the practical application of HGNNs, especially for resource-constrained devices. To mitigate this issue, we propose the Spiking Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks (SpikingHAN), which incorporates the brain-inspired and energy-saving properties of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) into heterogeneous graph learning to reduce the computing cost without compromising the performance. Specifically, SpikingHAN aggregates metapath-based neighbor information using a single-layer graph convolution with shared parameters. It then employs a semantic-level attention mechanism to capture the importance of different meta-paths and performs semantic aggregation. Finally, it encodes the heterogeneous information into a spike sequence through SNNs, simulating bioinformatic processing to derive a binarized 1-bit representation of the heterogeneous graph. Comprehensive experimental results from three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets show that SpikingHAN delivers competitive node classification performance. It achieves this with fewer parameters, quicker inference, reduced memory usage, and lower energy consumption. Code is available at https://github.com/QianPeng369/SpikingHAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge-Driven Federated Graph Learning on Model Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12624v4)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated graph learning (FGL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative graph representation learning, enabling multiple parties to jointly train models while preserving data privacy. However, most existing approaches assume homogeneous client models and largely overlook the challenge of model-centric heterogeneous FGL (MHtFGL), which frequently arises in practice when organizations employ graph neural networks (GNNs) of different scales and architectures.Such architectural diversity not only undermines smooth server-side aggregation, which presupposes a unified representation space shared across clients' updates, but also further complicates the transfer and integration of structural knowledge across clients. To address this issue, we propose the Federated Graph Knowledge Collaboration (FedGKC) framework. FedGKC introduces a lightweight Copilot Model on each client to facilitate knowledge exchange while local architectures are heterogeneous across clients, and employs two complementary mechanisms: Client-side Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation, which transfers effective knowledge between local and copilot models through bidirectional distillation with multi-view perturbation; and Server-side Knowledge-Aware Model Aggregation, which dynamically assigns aggregation weights based on knowledge provided by clients. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedGKC achieves an average accuracy gain of 3.88% over baselines in MHtFGL scenarios, while maintaining excellent performance in homogeneous settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[HeteroHBA: A Generative Structure-Manipulating Backdoor Attack on Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24665v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved strong performance in many real-world applications, yet targeted backdoor poisoning on heterogeneous graphs remains less studied. We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD. These results highlight practical backdoor risks in heterogeneous graph learning and motivate the development of stronger defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Graph Neural Network with Auxiliary Task Learning for Missing PMU Data Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24542v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In wide-area measurement systems (WAMS), phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurement is prone to data missingness due to hardware failures, communication delays, and cyber-attacks. Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior offline and online performance of the proposed method under high missing rates and incomplete observability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Networked Markets, Fragmented Data: Adaptive Graph Learning for Customer Risk Analytics and Policy Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24487v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial institutions face escalating challenges in identifying high-risk customer behaviors within massive transaction networks, where fraudulent activities exploit market fragmentation and institutional boundaries. We address three fundamental problems in customer risk analytics: data silos preventing holistic relationship assessment, extreme behavioral class imbalance, and suboptimal customer intervention strategies that fail to balance compliance costs with relationship value. We develop an integrated customer intelligence framework combining federated learning, relational network analysis, and adaptive targeting policies. Our federated graph neural network enables collaborative behavior modeling across competing institutions without compromising proprietary customer data, using privacy-preserving embeddings to capture cross-market relational patterns. We introduce cross-bank Personalized PageRank to identify coordinated behavioral clusters providing interpretable customer network segmentation for risk managers. A hierarchical reinforcement learning mechanism optimizes dynamic intervention targeting, calibrating escalation policies to maximize prevention value while minimizing customer friction and operational costs. Analyzing 1.4 million customer transactions across seven markets, our approach reduces false positive and false negative rates to 4.64% and 11.07%, substantially outperforming single-institution models. The framework prevents 79.25% of potential losses versus 49.41% under fixed-rule policies, with optimal market-specific targeting thresholds reflecting heterogeneous customer base characteristics. These findings demonstrate that federated customer analytics materially improve both risk management effectiveness and customer relationship outcomes in networked competitive markets.</p></details> |  |

Identifying optimal pacing sites remains challenging, largely due to patient-specific anatomical variability and limitations of current individualized planning strategies. In a step toward an in-silico approach, we develop two geometric deep learning models, based on graph neural network (GNN) and geometry-informed neural operator (GINO), to predict activation time maps on left ventricular (LV) geometries in real time. Trained on a large dataset generated from finite-element simulations spanning a wide range of synthetic LV shapes, pacing site configurations, and tissue conductivities, the GINO model outperforms the GNN on synthetic cases (1.38% vs 2.44% error), while both demonstrate comparable performance on real-world LV geometries (GINO: 4.79% vs GNN: 4.07%). Using the trained models, we develop a workflow to identify an optimal pacing site on the LV from a given activation time map and show that both models can robustly recover ground-truth subject-specific parameters from noisy inputs. In conjunction with an interactive web-based interface (https://dcsim.egr.msu.edu/), this study shows potential and motivates future extension toward a clinical decision-support tool for personalized pre-procedural CRT optimization.</p></details> |  |

Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (AI for Social Impact)</p></details> |

While physics-based numerical flood models are accurate, their substantial computational cost limits their use in operational settings where rapid predictions are essential. Models designed with graph neural networks (GNNs) provide both speed and accuracy while having the ability to process unstructured spatial domains. Given its flexible input and architecture, GNNs can be leveraged alongside physics-informed techniques with ease, significantly improving interpretability. This study introduces a novel flood GNN architecture, DUALFloodGNN, which embeds physical constraints at both global and local scales through explicit loss terms.

However, the competitive performance often relies on using handcrafted structural features as inputs, which increases computational cost and introduces bias into the otherwise purely data-driven network representations. Here, we eliminate the need for handcrafted features by introducing an attention mechanism and utilizing message-iteration profiles, in addition to an effective algorithmic approach to generate a structurally diverse training set of small synthetic networks. Thereby, we build an expressive message-passing framework and use it to efficiently solve the NP-hard problem of Network Dismantling, virtually equivalent to vital node identification, with significant real-world applications. Trained solely on diversified synthetic networks, our proposed model -- MIND: Message Iteration Network Dismantler -- generalizes to large, unseen real networks with millions of nodes, outperforming state-of-the-art network dismantling methods. Increased efficiency and generalizability of the proposed model can be leveraged beyond dismantling in a range of complex network problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Oral Presentation at the 40th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26), Main Technical Track</p></details> |

Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone. We discuss extensions of this approach to higher-dimensional Burgers systems and more general quantum partial differential equation solvers, highlighting learned error mitigation as a promising complement to physics-based noise reduction techniques on NISQ devices.</p></details> |  |

Yet inference remains challenging because the likelihood is often intractable. We show that, for a broad class of growing network models, information about model parameters is localized in the network, i.e., the likelihood can be expressed in terms of small subgraphs. We take a Bayesian perspective to inference and develop neural density estimators (NDEs) to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters using graph neural networks (GNNs) with limited receptive size, i.e., the GNN can only "see" small subgraphs. We characterize nine growing network models in terms of their localization and demonstrate that localization predictions agree with NDEs on simulated data. Even for non-localized models, NDEs can infer high-fidelity posteriors matching model-specific inference methods at a fraction of the cost. Our findings establish information localization as a fundamental property of network growth, theoretically justifying the analysis of local subgraphs embedded in larger, unobserved networks and the use of GNNs with limited receptive field for likelihood-free inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Existing detection approaches often fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies, temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable spectral filters and spatial-temporal differential modeling into a unified graph-based architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but also offers strong efficiency and resource allocation. Remarkably, SSTGNN accomplishes these results with up to 42$\times$ fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and resource-friendly for real-world deployment.</p></details> | Accepted to KDD 2026 |

| **[Task-driven Heterophilic Graph Structure Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23406v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to learn discriminative node representations for heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar labels and feature similarity provides weak structural cues. We propose frequency-guided graph structure learning (FgGSL), an end-to-end graph inference framework that jointly learns homophilic and heterophilic graph structures along with a spectral encoder. FgGSL employs a learnable, symmetric, feature-driven masking function to infer said complementary graphs, which are processed using pre-designed low- and high-pass graph filter banks. A label-based structural loss explicitly promotes the recovery of homophilic and heterophilic edges, enabling task-driven graph structure learning. We derive stability bounds for the structural loss and establish robustness guarantees for the filter banks under graph perturbations. Experiments on six heterophilic benchmarks demonstrate that FgGSL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and graph rewiring methods, highlighting the benefits of combining frequency information with supervised topology inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain matters: Towards domain-informed evaluation for link prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23371v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction, a foundational task in complex network analysis, has extensive applications in critical scenarios such as social recommendation, drug target discovery, and knowledge graph completion. However, existing evaluations of algorithmic often rely on experiments conducted on a limited number of networks, assuming consistent performance rankings across domains. Despite the significant disparities in generative mechanisms and semantic contexts, previous studies often improperly highlight ``universally optimal" algorithms based solely on naive average over networks across domains. This paper systematically evaluates 12 mainstream link prediction algorithms across 740 real-world networks spanning seven domains. We present substantial empirical evidence elucidating the performance of algorithms in specific domains. This findings reveal a notably low degree of consistency in inter-domain algorithm rankings, a phenomenon that stands in stark contrast to the high degree of consistency observed within individual domains. Principal Component Analysis shows that response vectors formed by the rankings of the 12 algorithms cluster distinctly by domain in low-dimensional space, thus confirming domain attributes as a pivotal factor affecting algorithm performance. We propose a metric called Winner Score that could identify the superior algorithm in each domain: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for social networks, Neighborhood Overlap-aware Graph Neural Networks for economics, Graph Convolutional Networks for chemistry, and L3-based Resource Allocation for biology. However, these domain-specific top-performing algorithms tend to exhibit suboptimal performance in other domains. This finding underscores the importance of aligning an algorithm's mechanism with the network structure.</p></details> |  |

While previous research has addressed dataset limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings, they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction. Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction. Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

While machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to cross-sectional classification and prediction tasks, effectively forecasting outcomes in longitudinal imaging studies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF). This model flexibly integrates both tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data, leveraging the temporal order of these variables within a coherent framework. By incorporating non-Euclidean and Euclidean sources of information from a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), the GNN-TF enables a comprehensive analysis that captures critical aspects of longitudinal imaging data. Comparative analyses against a variety of established machine learning and deep learning models demonstrate that GNN-TF outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior predictive accuracy for predicting future tobacco usage. The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of the proposed GNN-TF model successfully integrates multiple data modalities and leverages temporal dynamics, making it a valuable analytic tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Debugging Tabular Log as Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22903v1)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular log abstracts objects and events in the real-world system and reports their updates to reflect the change of the system, where one can detect real-world inconsistencies efficiently by debugging corresponding log entries. However, recent advances in processing text-enriched tabular log data overly depend on large language models (LLMs) and other heavy-load models, thus suffering from limited flexibility and scalability. This paper proposes a new framework, GraphLogDebugger, to debug tabular log based on dynamic graphs. By constructing heterogeneous nodes for objects and events and connecting node-wise edges, the framework recovers the system behind the tabular log as an evolving dynamic graph. With the help of our dynamic graph modeling, a simple dynamic Graph Neural Network (GNN) is representative enough to outperform LLMs in debugging tabular log, which is validated by experimental results on real-world log datasets of computer systems and academic papers.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRExplainer: A Universal Explanation Method for Temporal Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22772v1)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graphs are widely used to represent evolving real-world networks. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing such graphs, but the lack of transparency and explainability limits their practical adoption. Research on TGNN explainability is still in its early stages and faces several key issues: (i) Current methods are tailored to specific TGNN types, restricting generality. (ii) They suffer from high computational costs, making them unsuitable for large-scale networks. (iii) They often overlook the structural connectivity of explanations and require prior knowledge, reducing user-friendliness. To address these issues, we propose GRExplainer, the first universal, efficient, and user-friendly explanation method for TGNNs. GRExplainer extracts node sequences as a unified feature representation, making it independent of specific input formats and thus applicable to both snapshot-based and event-based TGNNs (the major types of TGNNs). By utilizing breadth-first search and temporal information to construct input node sequences, GRExplainer reduces redundant computation and improves efficiency. To enhance user-friendliness, we design a generative model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), enabling automated and continuous explanation generation. Experiments on six real-world datasets with three target TGNNs show that GRExplainer outperforms existing baseline methods in generality, efficiency, and user-friendliness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Epidemiology-informed Graph Neural Network for Heterogeneity-aware Epidemic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17372v2)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among various spatio-temporal prediction tasks, epidemic forecasting plays a critical role in public health management. Recent studies have demonstrated the strong potential of spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) in extracting heterogeneous spatio-temporal patterns for epidemic forecasting. However, most of these methods bear an over-simplified assumption that two locations (e.g., cities) with similar observed features in previous time steps will develop similar infection numbers in the future. In fact, for any epidemic disease, there exists strong heterogeneity of its intrinsic evolution mechanisms across geolocation and time, which can eventually lead to diverged infection numbers in two ``similar'' locations. However, such mechanistic heterogeneity is non-trivial to be captured due to the existence of numerous influencing factors like medical resource accessibility, virus mutations, mobility patterns, etc., most of which are spatio-temporal yet unreachable or even unobservable. To address this challenge, we propose a Heterogeneous Epidemic-Aware Transmission Graph Neural Network (HeatGNN), a novel epidemic forecasting framework. By binding the epidemiology mechanistic model into a GNN, HeatGNN learns epidemiology-informed location embeddings of different locations that reflect their own transmission mechanisms over time. With the time-varying mechanistic affinity graphs computed with the epidemiology-informed location embeddings, a heterogeneous transmission graph network is designed to encode the mechanistic heterogeneity among locations, providing additional predictive signals to facilitate accurate forecasting. Experiments on three benchmark datasets have revealed that HeatGNN outperforms various strong baselines. Moreover, our efficiency analysis verifies the real-world practicality of HeatGNN on datasets of different sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Causal Inference Under Network Confounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07823v5)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies causal inference with observational data from a single large network. We consider a nonparametric model with interference in both potential outcomes and selection into treatment. Specifically, both stages may be the outcomes of simultaneous equations models, allowing for endogenous peer effects. This results in high-dimensional network confounding where the network and covariates of all units constitute sources of selection bias. In contrast, the existing literature assumes that confounding can be summarized by a known, low-dimensional function of these objects. We propose to use graph neural networks (GNNs) to adjust for network confounding. When interference decays with network distance, we argue that the model has low-dimensional structure that makes estimation feasible and justifies the use of shallow GNN architectures.</p></details> |  |

Hence, they are critical components of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. While many existing systems depend on multiple sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam videos presents a more challenging, yet more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate improved spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to enhance state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets (DAD, DoTA and DADA) show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-accident scores than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Toward Real-World IoT Security: Concept Drift-Resilient IoT Botnet Detection via Latent Space Representation Learning and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22488v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although AI-based models have achieved high accuracy in IoT threat detection, their deployment in enterprise environments is constrained by reliance on stationary datasets that fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real-world IoT NetFlow traffic, which is frequently affected by concept drift. Existing solutions typically rely on periodic classifier retraining, resulting in high computational overhead and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a scalable framework for adaptive IoT threat detection that eliminates the need for continuous classifier retraining. The proposed approach trains a classifier once on latent-space representations of historical traffic, while an alignment model maps incoming traffic to the learned historical latent space prior to classification, thereby preserving knowledge of previously observed attacks. To capture inter-instance relationships among attack samples, the low-dimensional latent representations are further transformed into a graph-structured format and classified using a graph neural network. Experimental evaluations on real-world heterogeneous IoT traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains robust detection performance under concept drift. These results highlight the framework's potential for practical deployment in dynamic and large-scale IoT environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[GINTRIP: Interpretable Temporal Graph Regression using Information bottleneck and Prototype-based method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10996v2)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, but their inherent complexity makes them challenging to interpret. This is especially true for temporal graph regression tasks due to the complex underlying spatio-temporal patterns in the graph. While interpretability concerns in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) mirror those of DNNs, no notable work has addressed the interpretability of temporal GNNs to the best of our knowledge. Innovative methods, such as prototypes, aim to make DNN models more interpretable. However, a combined approach based on prototype-based methods and Information Bottleneck (IB) principles has not yet been developed for temporal GNNs. Our research introduces a novel approach that uniquely integrates these techniques to enhance the interpretability of temporal graph regression models. The key contributions of our work are threefold: We introduce the Graph INterpretability in Temporal Regression task using Information bottleneck and Prototype (GINTRIP) framework, the first combined application of IB and prototype-based methods for interpretable temporal graph tasks. We derive a novel theoretical bound on mutual information (MI), extending the applicability of IB principles to graph regression tasks. We incorporate an unsupervised auxiliary classification head, fostering diverse concept representation using multi-task learning, which enhances the model's interpretability. Our model is evaluated on real-world datasets like traffic and crime, outperforming existing methods in both forecasting accuracy and interpretability-related metrics such as MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

The need to process every neighbor for each node creates memory and computational bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce BLISS, a Bandit Layer Importance Sampling Strategy. It uses multi-armed bandits to dynamically select the most informative nodes at each layer, balancing exploration and exploitation to ensure comprehensive graph coverage. Unlike existing static sampling methods, BLISS adapts to evolving node importance, leading to more informed node selection and improved performance. It demonstrates versatility by integrating with both Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), adapting its selection policy to their specific aggregation mechanisms. Experiments show that BLISS maintains or exceeds the accuracy of full-batch training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 5th Muslims in ML Workshop co-located with NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Efficient Curvature-aware Graph Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01443v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph curvature provides geometric priors for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), enhancing their ability to model complex graph structures, particularly in terms of structural awareness, robustness, and theoretical interpretability. Among existing methods, Ollivier-Ricci curvature has been extensively studied due to its strong geometric interpretability, effectively characterizing the local geometric distribution between nodes. However, its prohibitively high computational complexity limits its applicability to large-scale graph datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a novel graph curvature measure--Effective Resistance Curvature--which quantifies the ease of message passing along graph edges using the effective resistance between node pairs, instead of the optimal transport distance. This method significantly outperforms Ollivier-Ricci curvature in computational efficiency while preserving comparable geometric expressiveness. Theoretically, we prove the low computational complexity of effective resistance curvature and establish its substitutability for Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Furthermore, extensive experiments on diverse GNN tasks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with Ollivier-Ricci curvature while drastically reducing computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional attack-based a posteriori robustness assessments incur prohibitive computational overhead. Recently, deep learning methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have been widely employed as surrogates for rapid robustness prediction. Nevertheless, these methods neglect the complex higher-order correlations prevalent in real-world systems, which are naturally modeled as hypergraphs. Although Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted for hypergraph learning, their topological expressive power has not yet reached the theoretical upper bound. To address this limitation, inspired by Graph Isomorphism Networks, this paper proposes a hypergraph-level Hypergraph Isomorphism Network framework. Theoretically, this approach is proven to possess an expressive power strictly equivalent to the Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test and is applied to predict hypergraph robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that while maintaining superior efficiency in training and prediction, the proposed method not only outperforms existing graph-based models but also significantly surpasses conventional HGNNs in tasks that prioritize topological structure representation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Reasoning of Large Language Models Integrating Graph-Structured Information for Pest and Disease Control in Tobacco](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21837v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a large language model (LLM) approach that integrates graph-structured information for knowledge reasoning in tobacco pest and disease control. Built upon the GraphRAG framework, the proposed method enhances knowledge retrieval and reasoning by explicitly incorporating structured information from a domain-specific knowledge graph. Specifically, LLMs are first leveraged to assist in the construction of a tobacco pest and disease knowledge graph, which organizes key entities such as diseases, symptoms, control methods, and their relationships. Based on this graph, relevant knowledge is retrieved and integrated into the reasoning process to support accurate answer generation. The Transformer architecture is adopted as the core inference model, while a graph neural network (GNN) is employed to learn expressive node representations that capture both local and global relational information within the knowledge graph. A ChatGLM-based model serves as the backbone LLM and is fine-tuned using LoRA to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, significantly improving both the accuracy and depth of reasoning, particularly in complex multi-hop and comparative reasoning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fairness-Aware Graph Representation Learning with Limited Demographic Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13540v3)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring fairness in Graph Neural Networks is fundamental to promoting trustworthy and socially responsible machine learning systems. In response, numerous fair graph learning methods have been proposed in recent years. However, most of them assume full access to demographic information, a requirement rarely met in practice due to privacy, legal, or regulatory restrictions. To this end, this paper introduces a novel fair graph learning framework that mitigates bias in graph learning under limited demographic information. Specifically, we propose a mechanism guided by partial demographic data to generate proxies for demographic information and design a strategy that enforces consistent node embeddings across demographic groups. In addition, we develop an adaptive confidence strategy that dynamically adjusts each node's contribution to fairness and utility based on prediction confidence. We further provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our framework, FairGLite, achieves provable upper bounds on group fairness metrics, offering formal guarantees for bias mitigation. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and fair graph learning frameworks, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in both mitigating bias and maintaining model utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Head Spectral-Adaptive Graph Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22291v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection technology has broad applications in financial fraud and risk control. However, existing graph anomaly detection methods often face significant challenges when dealing with complex and variable abnormal patterns, as anomalous nodes are often disguised and mixed with normal nodes, leading to the coexistence of homophily and heterophily in the graph domain. Recent spectral graph neural networks have made notable progress in addressing this issue; however, current techniques typically employ fixed, globally shared filters. This 'one-size-fits-all' approach can easily cause over-smoothing, erasing critical high-frequency signals needed for fraud detection, and lacks adaptive capabilities for different graph instances. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Head Spectral-Adaptive Graph Neural Network (MHSA-GNN). The core innovation is the design of a lightweight hypernetwork that, conditioned on a 'spectral fingerprint' containing structural statistics and Rayleigh quotient features, dynamically generates Chebyshev filter parameters tailored to each instance. This enables a customized filtering strategy for each node and its local subgraph. Additionally, to prevent mode collapse in the multi-head mechanism, we introduce a novel dual regularization strategy that combines teacher-student contrastive learning (TSC) to ensure representation accuracy and Barlow Twins diversity loss (BTD) to enforce orthogonality among heads. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively preserves high-frequency abnormal signals and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, especially showing excellent robustness on highly heterogeneous datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoEGCL: Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning for Multi-View Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05876v4)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has significantly propelled progress in Multi-View Clustering (MVC). However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks.

Policymakers, moderators and researchers have taken various routes to fight these campaigns and make online systems safer for regular users. To this end, our paper presents ALETHEIA, a system that formalizes the detection of malicious accounts (or troll accounts) used in such operations and forecasts their behaviors within social media networks. We analyze influence campaigns on Reddit and X from different countries and highlight that detection pipelines built over a graph-based representation of campaigns using a mix of topological and linguistic features offer improvement over standard interaction and user features. ALETHEIA uses state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for detecting malicious users that can scale to large networks and achieve a 3.7% F1-score improvement over standard classification with interaction features in prior work. Furthermore, ALETHEIA employs a first temporal link prediction mechanism built for influence campaigns by stacking a GNN over a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which can predict future troll interactions towards other trolls and regular users with an average AUC of 96.6%. ALETHEIA predicts troll-to-troll edges (TTE) and troll-to-user edges (TUE), which can help identify regular users being affected by malicious influence efforts. Overall, our results highlight the importance of utilizing the networked nature of influence operations (i.e., structural information) when predicting and detecting malicious coordinated activity in online spaces.</p></details> |  |

Attackers commonly target systems and infrastructure through methods such as malware, ransomware, or other forms of technical exploitation. Most traditional mechanisms to counter these threats rely on post-hoc detection and mitigation strategies, responding to cyber incidents only after they occur rather than preventing them proactively. Recent trends reveal social media discussions can serve as reliable indicators for detecting such threats. Malicious actors often exploit online platforms to distribute attack tools, share attack knowledge and coordinate. Experts too, often predict ongoing attacks and discuss potential breaches in online spaces. In this work, we present SENTINEL, a framework that leverages social media signals for early detection of cyber attacks. SENTINEL aligns cybersecurity discussions to realworld cyber attacks leveraging multi modal signals, i.e., combining language modeling through large language models and coordination markers through graph neural networks. We use data from 16 public channels on Telegram related to cybersecurity and open source intelligence (OSINT) that span 365k messages. We highlight that social media discussions involve active dialogue around cyber threats and leverage SENTINEL to align the signals to real-world threats with an F1 of 0.89. Our work highlights the importance of leveraging language and network signals in predicting online threats.</p></details> |  |

We present INSIGHT, a graph neural network that predicts survival directly from routine histology images. Trained and cross-validated on TCGA (n=342) and SURGEN (n=336), INSIGHT produces patient-level spatially resolved risk scores. Large independent validation showed superior prognostic performance compared with pTNM staging (C-index 0.68-0.69 vs 0.44-0.58). INSIGHT spatial risk maps recapitulated canonical prognostic histopathology and identified nuclear solidity and circularity as quantitative risk correlates. Integrating spatial risk with data-driven spatial transcriptomic signatures, spatial proteomics, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell references revealed an epithelium-immune risk manifold capturing epithelial dedifferentiation and fetal programs, myeloid-driven stromal states including $\mathrm{SPP1}^{+}$ macrophages and $\mathrm{LAMP3}^{+}$ dendritic cells, and adaptive immune dysfunction. This analysis exposed patient-specific epithelial heterogeneity, stratification within MSI-High tumours, and high-risk routes of CDX2/HNF4A loss and CEACAM5/6-associated proliferative programs, highlighting coordinated therapeutic vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
